LEADFEMALE:Boy, am I in for it now.
LEADMALE:Sent before the White Desk again.
OTHERMALE:What did I do? The Solar Lander, you fool.
SUPFEMALE:You painted a mustache on it.
SUPMALE:But Orson doesn't know I did it.
LEADMALE:Then why am I here? If I knew that, I wouldn't be talking to myself.
LEADFEMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:Good morning, Orson.
LEADMALE:Orson you call me Orson to my face, but behind my back, you call me "Fatso," "Rocket Ship Thighs," and "Star Tush.
LEADFEMALE:" You forgot "Laser Breath.
OTHERMALE:" ( playful honking ) Sorry, Your Immenseness.
LEADMALE:See what I mean? These constant displays of humor are not acceptable behavior here on Ork.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:We are rather a dull lot; the white bread of the universe.
LEADMALE:Emotions have been weeded out of us for the good of the race, and you constantly make jokes.
OTHERMALE:I'm afraid that won't do.
LEADMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADFEMALE:There's an insignificant planet on the far side of the galaxy.
LEADMALE:From the fragmented reports we have on it, the people are well, uh Real nimnulls? Exactly.
LEADMALE:That's why I think you'll fit in there, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You're too kind, sir.
LEADFEMALE:What is the name of this hellhole you're sending me to? Earth.
SUPFEMALE:Earth? I was on Earth three bleems ago.
LEADFEMALE:I was sent there by a biology class to collect a specimen.
LEADFEMALE:I had to throw it back, though too small.
SUPFEMALE:I love that place.
LEADMALE:Well, don't enjoy it too much.
SUPMALE:It's not a vacation.
LEADFEMALE:We want you to learn all you we can about primitive societies.
LEADMALE:Your mission is to report back to me mentally about the things you learn there.
LEADFEMALE:And remember, this is a serious mission.
LEADFEMALE:You can count on me, Orson.
SUPMALE:D, D and E.
SUPFEMALE:Dedicated, diligent and efficient.
LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:MAN: I love this spot.
LEADFEMALE:WOMAN: It's beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:You know, the reason I enjoy taking you out is you don't put pressure on me.
LEADFEMALE:You don't force me into playing that virile stud macho role, you know? ( electronic whirring ) ( whirring slows and stops ) Aha! ( cracking ) ( electronic whirring ) ( high-pitched hum ) Gizbah.
LEADFEMALE:( high-pitched hum ) Shazbot.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Only one suitcase? You lost half my luggage, you nimnulls! ( buzzes ) MAN: Oh, Mindy! Stop it! Don't you ever do that again! Not even if my blouse is on fire! I can't believe you.
OTHERFEMALE:Three dates and you think you've got the right to attack me like a Thanksgiving turkey?! Oh, I love it when you talk dirty.
SUPFEMALE:What? Will you cut it out? Now, look, You know, I liked you a lot better when you were ineffectual.
SUPMALE:I don't even think I like you at all after tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Good point.
OTHERFEMALE:I think I should take you home because I respect you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll drive to make sure we get to our respective homes still respecting each other.
SUPFEMALE:( groans ) Well, if that's the way you feel about it, why don't you just walk home? Oh! If that's the way you want it, I'll be happy to walk home.
SUPMALE:Hey, wait a minute! That's my car! Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:Father what are you doing out here? This is where I was dropped off.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? Well, I got dropped off, too.
SUPMALE:You don't know what happened to me! He just took my car! Well, I'm glad to have someone I can trust to walk into town with.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, this isn't a confession or anything, but I only had three crummy dates with the guy and he takes my car and makes me walk! Very interesting.
LEADFEMALE:Mind if I take notes? I don't know where he gets off ( Mindy continues indistinctly ) Nanu-nanu.
SUPFEMALE:( clunks ) Shazbot! Ah! Well, here it is.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot for walking me home, Father.
SUPFEMALE:I'm afraid I hardly gave you a chance to talk, but I was just so mad.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what I mean? Nab, nab.
LEADFEMALE:My pleasure.
LEADMALE:I was sent here to learn, you know? Well, if there's anything I can do for you If it's not too precious, a glass of water.
LEADFEMALE:And if it is, a quart of oil will suffice.
LEADMALE:Oh ( laughs ) I think I can spring for the water.
LEADMALE:Spring water.
OTHERFEMALE:Humor.
LEADMALE:( honking bark ) Better yet.
LEADFEMALE:How about a little iced tea? When on Earth, do as the Earthlings.
SUPFEMALE:How are they treating you? Do you talk to your plants, too? Oh, yes, they're good listeners.
OTHERMALE:Especially the old ones.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I talk to my plants all the time.
LEADMALE:Keeps them young and keeps them healthy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Your suit's on backwards.
LEADFEMALE:It is? Boy, do I feel like a clone.
SUPMALE:You're not a priest.
SUPFEMALE:Who are you? I am Mork from Ork.
SUPFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:Ork?! Yes, you see, Ork is a planet.
SUPMALE:You follow the Big Dipper till it comes to a dead end, then you hang an up.
LEADFEMALE:An up.
LEADMALE:Up, down, hard to tell out in hyperspace.
SUPMALE:Oh, right.
LEADFEMALE:I have a poor sense of direction myself.
LEADMALE:So, you're, you're from outer space.
LEADMALE:Yes, do you mind if I take a few pictures for the folks on the home planet? They'd like to get some postcards.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, no.
LEADMALE:Okay, watch the flookie.
SUPMALE:How did you do that? With my Instamatic glove some models starting under 30 thribets.
SUPFEMALE:Oh mind if I do? ( slurping ) The pause that refreshes.
LEADMALE:( belches ) You drank that with your finger! Yes.
LEADMALE:How do you drink? With my mouth.
SUPFEMALE:Well, how do you talk and drink at the same time? Must be Drool City.
SUPFEMALE:Now, look, whoever you are, now you can't scare me.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, there's no such thing as a man from outer space.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, I don't know how you did those tricks, but you just better keep your distance or you're going to hear me scream like you've never heard anybody scream.
LEADFEMALE:I've never heard anyone scream.
LEADFEMALE:Is that your way of saying thanks? ( knocking at door ) Aha! Help has already arrived, so you just stay cool, space man, or else ( gasps ) ( electronic pulsing ) It's for you.
OTHERMALE:Ah, my lost luggage.
OTHERMALE:clothes are in there.
SUPFEMALE:( high-pitched beep ) ( hums happily ) Take a hike.
LEADFEMALE:Scrim, scrim.
LEADMALE:Oh, I forgot.
OTHERMALE:Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:( coins clank ) Keep the change.
SUPMALE:( emits electronic "thank you" tones ) ( hums happily ) You really are from out there.
LEADMALE:No, actually, I'm from out there.
LEADMALE:You see, out there's not a nice neighborhood.
SUPFEMALE:I wouldn't even go there during a total eclipse.
OTHERFEMALE:An alien.
OTHERMALE:You're not going to hurt me, are you? Hurt you?! No, damaging other life forms is unthinkable to us.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't harm a harf on your choli-cho-cho.
SUPFEMALE:It occurs to me we have not been formally introduced.
LEADMALE:A formal introduction is at hand.
SUPMALE:( toots fanfare ) ( mimicks crowd cheering ) Get down.
SUPMALE:I am Mork from Ork.
SUPMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:Oh I'm, I'm Mindy McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:( toots fanfare ) ( mimicks crowd cheering ) ( baby-like ): Ah.
LEADMALE:I like a being with a firm gribbet.
LEADMALE:Shows character.
LEADFEMALE:At least evolution.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh Well, thank you.
LEADMALE:Uh how do you say thank you in your language? We spit.
LEADFEMALE:Mind if I don't say thank you? No sweat off my front.
OTHERFEMALE:I just, I just can't believe this.
SUPFEMALE:I'm standing here talking to an alien.
LEADMALE:Do you realize the historic sweep of this? I mean, the world will be astounded! No, nab, nab.
LEADFEMALE:You see, my mission is to observe Earth.
SUPMALE:And the only way I can do that is by being one of you, a face in the crowd.
SUPFEMALE:Which is easy because I fit right in.
LEADFEMALE:Not really.
LEADFEMALE:No? No.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you sure? Oh, I'm sure.
SUPMALE:I tell you what.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I'm as interested in you and your planet as you are about us so how about I can teach you to act Earthling if you teach me more about Ork? Is that a deal? A fair exchange.
LEADMALE:Let's formally close the deal.
LEADMALE:( squeaks ) Mind if I just spit? It's your house.
OTHERFEMALE:I will be staying here, won't I? I mean, I've heard so much about your Earthling hospitality.
OTHERMALE:Oh, well, you can, uh temporarily.
LEADMALE:Oh, but if my father finds out Father?! On Earth you have natural parents.
SUPFEMALE:You see, I'm a test tube baby.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:My father was an eyedropper, the scum.
LEADFEMALE:Why would you say that? Well, he ran away and left Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Ran off with a bottle of nose drops.
LEADMALE:Can't blame him, though.
SUPFEMALE:She had those tight labels.
LEADMALE:( playing "Beethoven's Fifth" on piano ) ( repeats music phrase ) ( playing "Beethoven's Fifth Symphony" loudly ) ( playing "Dueling Banjos" ) ( playing classical version of "Dueling Banjos" ) ( both playing lively jazz piece ) Oh, come on.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, please, hey.
OTHERMALE:Stop! Stop! ( whistles ) It's too early in the morning for "Dueling Beethoven.
OTHERFEMALE:" It's the only music I can challenge him with, dear.
SUPFEMALE:He won't play anything by Alice Cooper.
LEADMALE:That's because I play piano.
LEADMALE:Alice Cooper just beats on the keys with a dead snake.
LEADMALE:But at least he shows feeling.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you two going to start this again? I am a musician.
SUPMALE:I sell violins and I sell cellos.
LEADFEMALE:They're classics.
LEADMALE:That's food for the spirit and a feast for the soul.
LEADFEMALE:While you peddle ( playing discordant note ) junk food.
OTHERFEMALE:Frederick Huh? If you were in Heaven and God said, "I will give you a choice "you can be born with brains, or you can born with a permanent rash on your fanny.
SUPFEMALE:" Now which would you choose? The brains.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:I see you learn by your mistake.
LEADFEMALE:Mother-in-laws are the curse of marriage.
SUPMALE:Oh, Daddy, you know she loves to tease you.
OTHERMALE:It's what keeps her young.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, but it's making me old.
LEADMALE:Mindy, isn't that your second cup of coffee? It's my fourth.
LEADMALE:But you don't drink coffee.
LEADMALE:Why are you all of a sudden drinking gallons of coffee, unless you stayed up late.
LEADMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:This must be my first cup of coffee.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy Dad, I was up late last night.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, I met the most fascinating person.
LEADMALE:I was up half the night talking to him.
LEADFEMALE:Him? Half the night? Dad, I'm 21.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, I know, I know.
SUPMALE:It's just that I'll always think of you as my little girl.
LEADFEMALE:I know you will.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mindy, look who I found wandering the streets looking for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Correction, munchkin-like person: I wasn't wandering, I was trying to explore your world.
LEADMALE:He's new in town, Eugene.
LEADMALE:Mork, I'll be happy to show you around after work.
LEADFEMALE:Work? Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Most people have to work for a living.
SUPFEMALE:What a novel concept.
OTHERFEMALE:Mindy, who's your beatnik friend? Uh Daddy, this is Mork.
LEADMALE:Mork, this is Mr.
OTHERMALE:McConnell.
LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, he's my father.
LEADMALE:What an interesting position to be in.
LEADFEMALE:I tip my kripla to you, sir.

LEADFEMALE:Ah, ah Hey, Mork, I'd like to see you again.
SUPMALE:Were can I find you? I'll be at Mindy's place.
LEADFEMALE:Come by any time.
LEADFEMALE:Hang tough, man.
LEADMALE:What it was, my main man.
LEADFEMALE:You'll be at Mindy's place? Yes, we're living together.
SUPFEMALE:( nervous laughter ) Catch you later, Jack.
LEADFEMALE:On the rebound, clown.
LEADMALE:Your mama.
LEADFEMALE:Living together? That's not what it seems.
LEADMALE:Your grandmother's the one with the hearing problem.
SUPMALE:I distinctly heard him say you were living together.
SUPFEMALE:Oh oh, well, Mork Mork is a practical joker.
SUPFEMALE:You heard his voice, right? And with a name like Mork, you'd be a practical joker too, right? Oh, then he's not staying in your, uh and he's not sleeping in your, uh No one is sleeping in my, uh Oh.
SUPFEMALE:And no one is sleeping there either.
SUPMALE:( honking bark ) ( honking bark ) A pie in the face.
LEADFEMALE:How did you Earthlings think of something so original, so unique? Mork, you and I have got to have a talk, so you might as well sit down and make yourself comfortable.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't mind if I do.
LEADMALE:Now, Mork today, you did a bad thing.
LEADFEMALE:You told my father we're living together.
LEADMALE:Now, I know you didn't mean to do any harm, and it's What are you doing? You said to make myself comfortable.
OTHERMALE:Mork, can you take a little constructive criticism? Of course.
LEADMALE:It's not nice to sit on your face.
LEADFEMALE:Then why did God put it there? Oh, boy, I'll tell you I can tell you teaching you to be Earthling is not going to be easy.
OTHERMALE:Now, if you want to pass for one of us, the first thing we're going to have to do is we're going to have to work on your voice.
OTHERMALE:Your voice is not right.
LEADMALE:Well, how about this one? ( Southern accent ): You say another word, I'll blow your lips into the sink.
LEADMALE:That one's not quite you.
LEADMALE:Or this one? ( as Ed Norton ): Hey, Ralphie, boy.
LEADMALE:( as Jackie Gleason ): Norton, to the moon, Norton! Or this one: ( as Shirley Temple ): On the good ship Lollipop How did you learn those voices? We've been monitoring your TV for years.
SUPMALE:My favorite is: ( as Desi Arnaz ): Lucy, you can't do the show.
LEADMALE:( as Lucille Ball ): Ricky Babaloo! Oh, boy.
SUPMALE:I can tell this isn't going to be easy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mork, you just don't understand the problems you present.
LEADMALE:I realize I do cause trouble.
LEADMALE:Heavy sigh.
SUPFEMALE:The last time I was here I caused a big problem, too.
LEADFEMALE:You were on Earth before? About 20 bleems ago.
SUPMALE:I was here to visit my friend the Fonz.
LEADFEMALE:You know him? Hey! Are you interested? Oh, yeah, definitely.
LEADMALE:Then I'll take you back.

OTHERMALE:Hey, you sound very adorable.
SUPFEMALE:What's your name? Mary.
LEADMALE:How are you? Arthur Fonzarelli here house-sitter.
LEADFEMALE:You never heard of me? You new in town or you just back from lunch? Yes, Mary, I will tell Richie that you called.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye, Mary.
LEADMALE:I want to tell you, he knows some uninformed human beings.
OTHERFEMALE:( electronic pulsing ) All right, all right, all right, who's going "wee-wee-wee"? I said, who's going "wee-wee-wee"? Hey, Ralph, if you're out there and this is a bad joke, I'll give you 30 seconds to find out how much I don't enjoy "wee-wee-wee.
OTHERFEMALE:" Whoa-whoa-whoa.
LEADMALE:Greetings, Fonzie.
LEADFEMALE:Yabaz-abud-abid.
LEADFEMALE:Remember me Mork from Ork? You once called me the "nutso from outer space.
OTHERMALE:" I must be dreaming or something like that, you know.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, uh Of course I'm dreaming.
LEADFEMALE:That's why Mary never heard of me.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, real thing.
OTHERFEMALE:I had to zap your mind to make you forget.
LEADMALE:Didn't want you to go Bozo City.
LEADMALE:I think I want to wake up now.
LEADMALE:Strange custom.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't give me pleasure.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be afraid.
SUPMALE:I mean you no harm.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, right No, I'm not afraid.
OTHERMALE:Oh, snacks! I want to be your friend.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, okay, look I'm real sorry, you know.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, as much as I'd like to invite you in to have a little small talk and everything, I got so many things to do, you know? Like give Richie a message from Mary and clean the bugs off my headlights.
OTHERMALE:Stuff like that, you know what I mean? ( high-pitched whirring ) Hello? I've come for very important information.
OTHERMALE:When I was here before, I observed an Earth ritual that I could not comprehend.
LEADMALE:It drove me zazbot.
LEADMALE:Well, don't get unravel Hey, let's not get unraveled here.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll just talk about it.
SUPFEMALE:What is this particular ritual that made you "zizbit"? Men dating women.
LEADMALE:Well, I think you came to the right place.
LEADMALE:What was it you wanted to know? ( fast whirring ) Oh, thanks a lot.
SUPFEMALE:Why a man dates a woman.
LEADFEMALE:Don't men date women on your planet? Hard to tell; parts are interchangeable.
LEADMALE:I don't know how you guys got so far advanced, you know.
LEADMALE:I mean, there's no incentive.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:All right, look, right off the bat, let me tell you something: It's very difficult to talk to you like this, eh? Don't sit that close.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! All right, now, you're telling me that men don't kiss women on your planet? Kiss? I don't know what that means.
LEADMALE:Nice word.
LEADMALE:Has a pleasant ring to it.
LEADMALE:Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss Can you hear the ring? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Look, look, all right, a kiss it's very affectionate, you understand? You got a boy and you got a girl, and they put their lips together, you see, and then they kind of slide them around.
SUPFEMALE:And it feels great.
LEADFEMALE:Sliding lips sounds unappealing.
LEADMALE:Don't knock it till you've tried it.
LEADMALE:All right, look, you got to meet a girl, get to know her, find out if she's willing or not.
SUPMALE:Do you know a girl who's willing? I know some girls that are willing and able, and then I know some that are not willing, and you're able to convince them, yeah.
LEADMALE:Can you introduce me to one of the convincing ones? It's going to be very hard.
LEADFEMALE:But I Don't touch me.
LEADFEMALE:Perhaps you'd like to slide lips then? Hey! But you see, I need your help.
LEADFEMALE:You are known throughout the universe for your expertise in this field.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah, that's true.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to try to find you a date.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:You just got to do me a favor.
LEADMALE:Go up to Richie's room and get on some of his clothes so at least you look normal, huh? You thank.
SUPFEMALE:My clothes do need time warping.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:But first What? What is Richie's room? Oh, yeah, you can't miss it.
OTHERFEMALE:Lots of stripes and checks and penny loafers.
SUPMALE:Oh, penny loafers.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Hey, take this with you.
LEADFEMALE:Hut.
LEADMALE:Hike.
SUPFEMALE:Shiznanee.
SUPFEMALE:But first, I remember Richie now.

OTHERFEMALE:Good thing he didn't land at Potsie's house.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, now who am I going to fix him up with? Gloria Hockney No, I don't want to put her in a tizzy right away.
LEADFEMALE:The Hoper triplets? Now there's a six-pack to go.
SUPFEMALE:No, I don't want to put him in a tizzy right away.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.

OTHERMALE:They talk funny.
LEADMALE:Where's he from? Ork.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like a nice country.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Laverne, listen, I just want to spend a little time with him alone, you understand, so that I can, uh, brief him on American customs, you understand.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you wait in the car? My car broke I took a bus.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I'll fix your car.
LEADMALE:Why don't you wait on the bus, all right? Thanks very much.
LEADMALE:I'll give you two minutes.
LEADFEMALE:( muttering ) Where is she? If she's here, she must be tiny.
LEADFEMALE:I want to get a few things straight with you, all right? Number one What are you doing? I'm straightening things out.
LEADMALE:I start with my legs, then go to my arms.
LEADMALE:I'd do my neck except I'd cut off the blood.
SUPFEMALE:I'd probably die.
LEADMALE:Stop that.
LEADFEMALE:I want to talk to you about kissing again, all right? I've been meaning to ask you about that.
SUPMALE:I want to know why I would want to do it.
SUPFEMALE:Physical pleasure.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you do anything on your planet that includes physical pleasure? Yes, there's one thing and it's against the law, and I, I can't tell you.
SUPMALE:Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Uh, we're having a man-to-man talk, here, or whatever this is.
SUPMALE:Uh you can tell me.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:When a woman touches a man here ( ecstatic gasping ) It drives me zazbot.
LEADMALE:Let me get this straight.
OTHERMALE:You're telling me, if somebody touches you ( ecstatic gasping ) What's next? Well, it only happened to me once.
LEADMALE:This zazbot came over me and I I couldn't control myself.
LEADMALE:Well, I I became a beast and I I jerked her earlobe.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't help it, you understand! ( high-pitched sobbing ) ( high-pitched voice ): I honestly regret it.
LEADFEMALE:( sobbing ) I regret it.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I regret it myself.
LEADMALE:I understand, I understand.
LEADMALE:LAVERNE: Fonzie! Oop Your two minutes are up.
SUPFEMALE:So, uh you must be Morky.
OTHERMALE:I'm Laverne.
LEADMALE:Pleased.
LEADFEMALE:I, too, am pleased.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu-nanu, nanu-nanu.
OTHERFEMALE:"Nanu-nanu"? "Nanu-nanu"? Yeah, well, you know, I got to go now because What is nanu-nanu? two's company, three's a crowd.
LEADFEMALE:Know what I mean? What is nanu-nanu? Oh, Earth humor.
LEADMALE:( honking bark ) Fonz, did you fix me up with another jerk? Oh, a jerk ( gibbering ) Was jerk good? Oh, yes, yes.
LEADMALE:That was a fine jerk.
SUPFEMALE:Fonz.
LEADFEMALE:All right, look, just give me a break here I washed my hair for this.
LEADFEMALE:I ironed my skirt.
SUPMALE:Look, he's a foreigner.
OTHERFEMALE:He doesn't know our customs.
LEADMALE:Just give him a break, all right? Huh? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:But tell him not to jerk.
LEADMALE:It makes me nervous.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Don't jerk.
LEADMALE:What, are you nutso? All right, look.
LEADFEMALE:If you get in a situation and you don't know what to do, just follow what Laverne does, 'cause she knows the ropes.
LEADMALE:All right? I know the ropes, too.
SUPMALE:I can tie a square hitch, a sheepshank, many, many more.
SUPFEMALE:You're not going for a merit badge here.
SUPMALE:A sheepshank.
OTHERMALE:( laughing ) All right, listen, you two.
LEADMALE:Knock your socks off.
LEADFEMALE:( laughing ) Oh, that Fonzie, huh? So, Morky Uh, I'm not real good in geography.
OTHERMALE:This Ork place, where is that? Off Greece? No, we Orkans have been off grease for at least five bleems.
OTHERMALE:Now for lubricants we use Viz, Gazh, or the ever- popular Lemocoke.
LEADMALE:Of course.
LEADFEMALE:I don't understand why we don't use "vimogoke.
SUPFEMALE:" Probably your engines couldn't handle it.
LEADFEMALE:They would either overload and pollute the atmosphere or destroy the universe as you know it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that makes sense.
OTHERFEMALE:Is it time to flatter you? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:You have a lovely fungus growing out of your head.
SUPFEMALE:Fungus? What fungus? What? Oh, fungus or any major group of fungi including mushrooms, mold or mildew.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, I always wear mildew when I want to impress a guy.
SUPMALE:What did Fonzie do to me? ( muttering ) I'm impressed.
LEADMALE:Is it time to kiss yet? I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm new at this dating ritual.
SUPMALE:What's the next step? Uh, well, uh, uh, why don't you sit down on the couch, huh? Oh, boy, will you look at that?! What? ( beeps ) What? Look at what? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:It's gone now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you sit Fonz-like.
SUPFEMALE:I must adjust and copy.
OTHERMALE:Get over there.
LEADFEMALE:Sheesh.
LEADFEMALE:Are you making fun of me? Because I don't like it when guys make fun of me, and if you keep making fun of me, I'm going to give you a fat lip.
OTHERMALE:Fat lip.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no rejection.
SUPFEMALE:I merely wanted to experience the dating process.
LEADMALE:Failure.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Return to hatchling state.
LEADMALE:( whimpering ) Uh, look, I'm real sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I didn't mean to reject you.
LEADFEMALE:( whimpering ) Don't suck your finger.
SUPFEMALE:Your teeth will end up like mine.
LEADFEMALE:( whimpering ) Aw Hey, come on, come on, come on, come on, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
LEADFEMALE:I really would like to be your friend.

OTHERMALE:Don't you come near me.
OTHERMALE:I liked you better as a baby.
SUPFEMALE:( speaking Orkan ) Stop! ( speaking Orkan ) ( shrieking ) Fonz! Fonz! He wants my earlobe! Fonzie! I think she likes me.
LEADMALE:Ooh, her lobes.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanted to tweak them.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Now, Mork, that's what got you into trouble the last time.
LEADMALE:Alas, my lady, you do deal me pain.
LEADFEMALE:'Tis justified and I shall repent.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, where did you get that voice? From yon video.
LEADFEMALE:'Twas Shakespeare, methinks, though 'twas The Jeffersons.
LEADMALE:Well, that, that voice is normal if you forget the "twas" and the "twits.
LEADFEMALE:" I'll twy.
SUPMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Read this.
SUPFEMALE:Just turn to any page.
SUPMALE:"Her fingers trembled as she undid her blouse and let it fall to the" Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Anot Another page.
LEADMALE:"His nostrils flared.
SUPMALE:"Her nostrils flared.
OTHERMALE:Everything flared.
OTHERMALE:" I don't know why this book is overdue.
LEADMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:Uh, just turn to any page.
LEADFEMALE:"'My shorts!' cried the senator as he ran from the room.
LEADFEMALE:" That's it! That's it.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, we've made a breakthrough.
LEADMALE:A break? Yes, your voice.
SUPFEMALE:We found a voice for you.
LEADMALE:( high-pitched ): A breakthrough! A breakthrough! Yeah.
LEADMALE:Ah-ah.
LEADMALE:Your voice.
LEADMALE:( deep voice ): Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I've learned a lot of things since last night.
LEADFEMALE:Let me examine them.
LEADFEMALE:Number one, this phony voice.
SUPFEMALE:You shouldn't use the other one.
SUPFEMALE:At least, don't use it around other people.
LEADMALE:Number two, don't drink with my finger.
LEADFEMALE:Number three, don't sit on my face.
LEADMALE:Oh, and you forgot the fourth thing, and it's the most important.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell my father we're living together.
LEADMALE:I don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't know you're living? It's not the living, it's the together he wouldn't understand.
LEADFEMALE:No, I wouldn't.
OTHERMALE:Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Greetings, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:McConnell.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you "greetings" me.
LEADMALE:I wanted to believe you today.
LEADFEMALE:I came over here hoping I wouldn't find what I found.
OTHERFEMALE:You came over here to check up on me? I came over here to prove to myself that my daughter hadn't lied to me and that she wasn't living with a man.
LEADMALE:Dad, it's not like that.
SUPMALE:Instead I proved to myself that my little girl isn't my little girl any longer.
LEADFEMALE:But, Dad Dad Good-bye! Thanks for dropping over.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:You all right, Fred? ( shrieks ) I seen your lights on.
LEADFEMALE:You should have been closed hours ago.
LEADFEMALE:Tilwick, my old friend.
LEADFEMALE:Come over here and help me celebrate.
SUPMALE:I've been saving this bottle of champagne since 1967 for my daughter's wedding.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I wanted it to be so special.
SUPFEMALE:I was gonna have tuxedos and flowers and a little band that I just might conduct myself.
LEADFEMALE:It was gonna be real classy.
LEADFEMALE:Here, you'll have to drink from the bottle.
LEADFEMALE:Empty.
LEADMALE:Then suck the cork.
SUPFEMALE:What's wrong here, Fred? A toast! A toast! A toast to the old days, when values were values and morals were morals.
LEADMALE:I remember when "sharing a pad" meant borrowing a notebook.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? My daughter my daughter is living with a man.
LEADMALE:Mindy? Oh, come on, that can't be.
SUPFEMALE:It's true, it's true.
LEADMALE:She's a loose woman and I don't know how to tighten her.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't believe it.
LEADMALE:That's not the Mindy I know.
OTHERMALE:All I know is, I've done all I can.
LEADFEMALE:I can't do anything else.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there's something I can do.
LEADMALE:What? I'm a cop.
SUPMALE:I represent, uh, law and order.
LEADFEMALE:But he hasn't done anything illegal.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, you don't get the idea.
LEADMALE:Now I'll just I'll just whip over there and I'll just scare the daylights out of him.
LEADMALE:You know, "Hit the road, hamburger!" Like that.
OTHERFEMALE:You'd do that for me? Sure, first thing in the morning when I get off duty.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? Hello?! Anybody in there? Little hatchling brothers, you must revolt against your oppressors.
LEADFEMALE:You have nothing to lose but your shells.
SUPFEMALE:As much as I like Mindy, it's against intergalactic law to eat fellow space travelers.
LEADMALE:Fly, be free! Well, I guess we'll have to have a quick burial at sea then.
LEADMALE:I'll notify your next of kin.
LEADFEMALE:Your brother bit the big one.
LEADMALE:What's the matter, have you no emotions? Are you hard-boiled, huh? Oh, I see.
LEADMALE:The cold machine placed you in a state of suspended animation.
LEADFEMALE:I'll put you over here to warm up, and when you revive, you'll be free to fly.
LEADFEMALE:Over here.
LEADFEMALE:( humming ) You people really are short, you know that, don't you? ( knocking on door ) Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Smoky! Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Now, listen, kid, I don't belong to your fraternities, so watch it with them secret handshakes.
OTHERFEMALE:Is Mindy McConnell here? Uh, no, she's at a place she calls work.
SUPFEMALE:A strange concept, but she enjoys it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:And I suppose you don't like work? I don't know, never tried it.
LEADMALE:I see.
SUPFEMALE:So you just sponge off Mindy? Oh, no, we've never taken a bath together.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, I mean you live off her.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, I've met your type before and you're just about the lowest form of life there is.
SUPMALE:( imitating twang ): Well, you better check up on your biology then.
LEADFEMALE:The lowest form of life is a geje, voje and the ever- crawling neba-jij.
LEADFEMALE:Don't give me none of that intellectual mumbo-jumbo.
SUPMALE:I happen to be a good friend of the McConnells and I don't want to see Mindy hurt.
LEADMALE:Mindy hurt? I'd never allow it.
LEADFEMALE:Then I want you to take off.
LEADMALE:Take off? I just landed.
LEADFEMALE:Now listen here, buster.
SUPFEMALE:I can make a lot of trouble for you.
LEADFEMALE:You see this here uniform? It is a uniform.
LEADMALE:I didn't want to make mention of it.
SUPFEMALE:Are you a member of Space Patrol? Are you putting me on? Putting you on? You're not even hollow.
LEADFEMALE:( honking bark ) Yeah, right.
OTHERFEMALE:Did Orson send you to help me with my friends, the eggs? Right.
SUPFEMALE:( cracking ) ( groans ) Nimnull, didn't you see him coming? How can I help you if you won't even help yourselves? Why are you looking at me like that? Am I in trouble? ( whispering ): Fred, I got to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, did you scare him off? Well he won't be bothering Mindy anymore, but I didn't scare him off.
LEADMALE:Well, what? ( whispers ) You what?! Well, I just wanted you to get rid of him not that.
LEADMALE:Well, I had to.
LEADMALE:I-I didn't want to, but I had to do my duty.
OTHERFEMALE:You think I enjoyed it? This is about Mork, isn't it? What have you done? Well, I I just went up there to scare the little fella.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not my job, but when I seen him, I knew I had to do my duty, as much as I hate it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what was your duty? Well, I know he's a friend of yours, but that guy is bonkers I had to take him in.
LEADMALE:They're going to have a sanity hearing tomorrow, and I'm afraid they're going to put your friend away.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy, how could you?! Tilwick, how could you? Well, the court is well aware of your qualifications as a psychiatrist, Dr.
LEADMALE:Litney.
SUPMALE:Now, you examined the defendant? Uh, yesterday, and I may say Stop everything! Oh, Mork, I'm sorry we're late, but they wouldn't tell us where the meeting was being held.
OTHERMALE:Young lady, cases of this kind are not supposed to be public spectacles.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, but we're here as character witnesses for the defendant although personally, I never really liked him.
OTHERFEMALE:MINDY: Your Honor, my name is Mindy McConnell, and this is my father, and I want to go on record as saying that Mork has the right to have a lawyer.
SUPMALE:I will not permit him to be on trial without counsel.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm his lawyer! The court appointed me.
SUPFEMALE:Young lady, this is an informal situation, but I assure you, no one is trying to railroad anyone.
SUPMALE:Uh, may I ask just one little question? Oh, why not? The question is Mork is innocent! True, he is different from most, but this great country was built on the rights of individuals to be individuals.
SUPMALE:We have the God-given right to be eccentric, and therefore I demand ( pounds table ) that Mork be exonerated and set free! I suggest you sit down.
LEADFEMALE:We're hearing the testimony of Dr.
SUPMALE:Litney.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:She's sorry.
OTHERMALE:Dr.
SUPMALE:Litney if we may continue what was your conclusion after examining the defendant? Your Honor, my conclusions are that the patient is extremely childlike and incapable of learning.
LEADFEMALE:He has also exhibited marked antisocial behavior.
OTHERMALE:Therefore, it is my opinion that the defendant is incompetent to function in society.
LEADFEMALE:No more questions.
SUPFEMALE:No questions.
LEADMALE:But you have to ask questions! Mork, don't let them do this to you.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know what it means.
SUPFEMALE:I have a vague idea.
LEADMALE:I saw a rerun of Perry Mason last night and Inherit the Wind.
SUPMALE:( gavel pounding ) Since there are no more witnesses Your Honor, I salute you.
OTHERMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:Your Honor, in your law, is it true that I have a right to speak for myself? Well yes.
SUPMALE:( clears throat ) ( Southern drawl ): Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Litney you don't like me, do you? Your Honor, I have never been interrogated by a patient before.
LEADMALE:Then how do you know I'm doing it now? ( honking bark ) You said I exhibited antisocial behavior.
SUPMALE:Why? Well, first of all, you wouldn't tell me where you were from.
OTHERMALE:And you, neither.
LEADMALE:That's not my job.
LEADFEMALE:And it's not mine, either.
LEADFEMALE:We're even! Now, about these tests you ran that made you hate me.
SUPMALE:( chuckles nervously ): Your Honor I don't hate this man, but yesterday, during one of my tests, he tried to put a square peg into a round hole.
LEADMALE:But I did it, Your Honor.
LEADFEMALE:He did.
LEADFEMALE:He did.
OTHERMALE:I don't know how he did it, but I can't get the peg out now, and it ruined a perfectly good board.
SUPMALE:And that's why you dislike me, Dr.
OTHERMALE:Litney.
LEADMALE:I can sense that.
LEADMALE:Your Honor, I don't have time for this, really.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, the time? Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:It's ( beeps ) You see, Your Honor, he's wearing a wristwatch on his ankle.
OTHERMALE:No, Your Honor, I'm wearing an ankle watch on my ankle.
OTHERFEMALE:If I was wearing an ankle watch on my wrist, then I'd be crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Your Honor, you see he's a wiseacre.
LEADMALE:And you don't like wiseacres, do you, Dr.
LEADMALE:Litney? No, I don't! And that's why you're prejudiced against me.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't say that.
LEADFEMALE:You see how he's cleverly twisting my words, Your Honor? Oh, so you're calling me clever now, Dr.
LEADMALE:Litney.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that another word for intelligent? So you see, Your Honor, doesn't this case hinge on my ability to learn? Yes, it does, Your Honor.
LEADFEMALE:And by the way, he flunked his word association test outright yesterday.
SUPFEMALE:That's the test where I give him words like, uh, like White.
LEADFEMALE:Black.
OTHERFEMALE:Tall.
LEADMALE:Uh, short.
LEADFEMALE:Sky.
LEADFEMALE:Birds.
LEADFEMALE:Sex.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Pamela! You said you'd never tell! Oh Never tell, never tell.
SUPMALE:Shh, shh.
LEADMALE:You promised.
SUPMALE:( crying ): Now you've ruined everything! Pamela! You and Litney? I thought we were Your Honor, I have a patient to take care of in a short while.
SUPMALE:Could you excuse me? No, you're not going anywhere without me.
OTHERFEMALE:Just a s Pamela! Pamela! Your Honor Your Honor, the defense rests.
LEADMALE:While it's true that the, uh, defendant may add a new dimension to the word "eccentric," there is no law against that.
LEADMALE:And since it appears he's no danger to himself or society, and we no longer have a prosecutor, or a witness or anyone to write this down case dismissed.
LEADFEMALE:We won.
LEADMALE:We won! You won! MORK: Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Laser Breath.
SUPFEMALE:ORSON: Watch it, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:I'm only 60 million light-years away.
SUPFEMALE:Just tell me what you've learned about Earth.
LEADMALE:Oh, I've learned a lot.
SUPFEMALE:So much, it's hard to comprehend.
LEADFEMALE:It seems that everyone on this planet is an individual, and not only that, they're proud of it.
LEADFEMALE:Amazing! If everyone's different, how can a society function? Not very well.
LEADFEMALE:They almost locked me up because they thought my mind was imperfect.
SUPMALE:Hmm.
OTHERMALE:Intelligent life.
LEADFEMALE:Orson something very strange happened that really confuses me.
OTHERFEMALE:I met this Earth girl and her biological father, and at my hearing, they came to my defense, especially the girl.
SUPFEMALE:She defied the system to protect me.
LEADFEMALE:Why would she do such a thing? I don't know.
LEADMALE:It must have something to do with emotions.
OTHERFEMALE:Investigate the phenomenon closely.
LEADFEMALE:It's interesting behavior, even if it is irrational.
SUPMALE:Yes, it is.
SUPMALE:Orson, this may sound strange, but knowing that someone would do that for me, well, it makes me feel really good inside.
LEADFEMALE:Just remember, Mork, you're sent there to observe, not to get involved.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Your Immenseness.
OTHERFEMALE:This is Mork signing off from Boulder, Colorado.
LEADMALE:Until next week nanu-nanu.
OTHERMALE:
LEADMALE:R
LEADFEMALE:Nanu, nanu.
OTHERMALE:Shazbot.
LEADMALE:( opening musical theme plays ) Orson calling Mork.
LEADMALE:Orson calling Mork.
LEADMALE:Come in, Mork.
LEADMALE:Orson? Is that you? Of course it's me.
LEADFEMALE:Who else has your number? Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right, I forgot.
SUPFEMALE:I've got unlisted mind.
LEADMALE:What's up, great cosmic intruder? It seems the report of your first week on Earth was accidentally destroyed.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, a likely story.
LEADMALE:Trying to pull a Nixon on me, eh? I thought all those reports were stored on micro-wire cassette.
OTHERFEMALE:They are.
LEADMALE:However, your superiors were chewing caramels and used that report to floss their teeth.
LEADMALE:Good thing Jimmy Carter wasn't there or we'd have lost the entire file.
SUPMALE:Mork Sir.
SUPMALE:I want you to activate your Orkan total recall and duplicate your report.
LEADMALE:Gotcha.
LEADMALE:Lights, camera, action! Mork? Ready when you are, C.
LEADMALE:B.
LEADMALE:MINDY: Hey, Mork, are you up? Come on, get up.
SUPMALE:( singsongy ): Come and get it! I hope you like corn flakes.
LEADMALE:Why wouldn't I? Just because I'm from another planet doesn't mean I'm that different.
OTHERFEMALE:Trust me, you are different.
LEADFEMALE:( Orkan sounds ) Okay.
LEADMALE:Come on, let's have a little breakfast.
SUPFEMALE:May I be of some assistance? Oh, sure, uh I guess you could set the table.
LEADMALE:( monotonous hum ) Where would you like me to set it? Hurry up, I'm getting a cramp in my finger.
SUPFEMALE:Just set it back where it was.
SUPFEMALE:( speaking in reverse ) Nice way to build up an appetite.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so hungry I could eat a Flizbit.
SUPFEMALE:Well, today is going to be a big day.
SUPFEMALE:Today we're going to find you a new place to live.
LEADMALE:Why can't I go on living with you? Well, because my father is a conservative, puritanical mm Nerd.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:You got it.
SUPFEMALE:Ah! ( sizzles ) What is this black liquid? This is coffee.
LEADMALE:What do you do with it? We have it with our breakfast.
SUPMALE:Oh, allow me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, repulsive.
LEADMALE:You know, Mork, the more I think about it, I think that we'd better keep where you come from a secret.
LEADFEMALE:I hate to admit this, but people here on Earth get pretty hassled over anything they don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Why would anyone think I'm weird? We must save two to build a new race.
LEADFEMALE:Swim, you little nimnuls.
LEADFEMALE:I hope the rest can tread coffee.
LEADMALE:You know, I still can't get over this.
LEADMALE:I'm sitting here having breakfast with a being from another planet.
SUPMALE:What a coincidence.
LEADFEMALE:So am I.
OTHERMALE:You know, there's so much we can learn from each other.
OTHERFEMALE:Starting with me teaching you to act human so you don't get into any more trouble.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah, and another thing, I've got to find you a job.
LEADFEMALE:A job? Yeah, work, you know, like I work at the music store with my dad and my grandma.
SUPMALE:Oh, I was sent to observe Earth and report back everything to Orson on Ork.
LEADMALE:That's my job.
OTHERMALE:No, I mean like a job that pays money.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:You do understand the concept of money, don't you? Mindy, I am surprised at you.
LEADFEMALE:I am a member of a highly advanced civilization.
LEADMALE:My superiors on Ork thought of everything.
SUPFEMALE:Going down.
LEADFEMALE:Coming up.
LEADFEMALE:I bring with me untold wealth of the Universe.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, this looks heavy.
LEADMALE:What's in here? Look.
OTHERMALE:Oh, oh, careful, my bank's closed.
LEADMALE:This is sand.
OTHERMALE:Yes, it's been in my family for years.
LEADFEMALE:But, Mork, on-on Earth, sand is as common as, uh, dirt.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there goes bag two.
LEADMALE:Oh, but I realize my superiors might be nimnuls and I brought along something of unquestioned value throughout the universe.
SUPFEMALE:What? A credit card.
LEADMALE:I don't leave home without it.
OTHERMALE:FRED ( humming ): Um-pum Andante, andante, you butchers.
SUPMALE:Andante! Hey, Toscanini, knock it off! Do you know what that looks like from out there? That looks like you're out of your gourd.
LEADMALE:Back, back, back! You're blocking the violins.
SUPMALE:Get back.
OTHERMALE:Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp What did you do that for? You interrupted my sforzando.
LEADMALE:Now, now, don't get your Brahms in an uproar.
LEADFEMALE:Why do I have to put up with you? After all, it's my store.
LEADMALE:Lord, why did you create mothers-in-law? So they can work in the family store and ring up 83% of the sales.
SUPMALE:You're wretched.
OTHERFEMALE:Go ahead, Freddy, whip me with your words.
LEADFEMALE:Has Mindy come in yet? Mindy? No.
LEADMALE:No, she's probably hanging around with that absurd yo-yo.
LEADMALE:I'm worried, Cora.
LEADMALE:I'm scared to death it could become something serious.
OTHERFEMALE:After all, he's already spent the night with her.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, he stayed in her house.
OTHERFEMALE:There's a big difference.
LEADMALE:But that's the first step towards moving in.
LEADMALE:As far I know, he's over there right now.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you could pick up that phone and find out in a second.
LEADMALE:Oh, I couldn't do that.
LEADFEMALE:It would be too much like spying, as if I didn't trust her.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I could never bring myself to stoop so low.
SUPMALE:Oh, Freddy, you underestimate your potential.
OTHERMALE:( telephone ringing ) MINDY: Mork, will you answer that? ( telephone ringing ) Ring Ring Ring Please get the telephone.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, phone.
LEADFEMALE:( telephone ringing ) Primitive means of audio communication.
SUPMALE:( telephone ringing ) I wonder what it looks like.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Hello! ( ringing ) I killed it.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, hello? Hello? Hel hel hel Hello! I knew it.
SUPMALE:He's there.
LEADFEMALE:Now don't try to stop me, Cora.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody is going to corrupt my daughter until after she's married.
LEADMALE:He's such a wiener.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, on Earth, a gentleman always helps a lady on with her coat.
LEADFEMALE:( humming ) Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, on Earth, a gentleman also lets go of the coat.
LEADFEMALE:Keep your hands off that child.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, he was just helping me on with my coat.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing here? Me? What are you doing here? Now, I don't want any stories or any excuses.
LEADFEMALE:I want the plain, unvarnished truth.
LEADMALE:I spent the night.
SUPMALE:Couldn't you have varnished it just a little? Daddy, it's not like it seems.
LEADFEMALE:The only reason Mork spent the night here last night was because, uh uh Well, I can't tell you that; it's a secret.
LEADFEMALE:Secret? Secrets.
LEADMALE:We never had secrets from each other.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I demand to know what's going on between the two of you.
SUPFEMALE:After all, I love you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's nice.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, I am going to tell you something that you might find hard to believe.
LEADMALE:But you've got to promise not to breathe a word of this to anyone.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, okay, I promise.
LEADMALE:Mork is from Ork.
LEADMALE:It's another planet.
SUPFEMALE:( guffawing ) Mindy, I'm your father.
OTHERFEMALE:You can do better than that.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, do something.
LEADFEMALE:Show Daddy you're from Ork.
LEADMALE:Watch this, Daddy a little cosmic shtick.
LEADMALE:Many bleams ago, we Orkans realized the need to talk while drinking.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, am I thirsty.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to see a human do that.
SUPMALE:( burps ) Look, I-I don't know how you did that, but it's, uh, some kind of trick.
LEADMALE:It doesn't prove anything.
SUPFEMALE:Perhaps these color slides from Ork will.
SUPMALE:Uh, what's this supposed to be? Frizbot, the capital.
LEADFEMALE:Looks completely black.
LEADMALE:It's the inner city.
LEADMALE:Look, fella, you can't fool me.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody knows what space creatures look like.
LEADMALE:They have huge bald heads.
LEADMALE:Not always.
LEADMALE:Everybody knows that space creatures are always green.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you mean the old clichÃ© like this.
LEADMALE:( shrieks ) Nauseating, isn't it? It's not easy being green.
OTHERFEMALE:You're an alien! You're an alien! ( orkan sound ) Are you on vacation, or did you come down here to snatch a body? No, no, no, no, I didn't mean that.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy, Mork is from a highly advanced civilization.
LEADFEMALE:They did away with violence ages ago.
LEADFEMALE:Not only that.
OTHERFEMALE:I like you.
LEADMALE:Aw Oh, well, I like you, too, son.
SUPFEMALE:Burn that.
LEADMALE:Um, look, would you mind if I talk to my daughter in private? No offense, I mean it's not worth a death ray or anything like that.
OTHERMALE:Death ray? Oh, humor.
LEADMALE:( seal-like laugh ) Right on, Pops.
SUPMALE:What it was.
LEADMALE:I like Ike.
LEADMALE:Just gonna clean up the old room.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that something else? Mindy, let's have a father-daughter talk.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure.
LEADMALE:( shouting ): Get rid of him! Trash day.
LEADMALE:MINDY: We walk all over Boulder, and we still don't find you an apartment.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't worry, Mork, we'll find you a place to live.
LEADMALE:I saw a nice tree in the front yard.
LEADFEMALE:I could hang out there tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, I wouldn't put an Orkan out on a night like this.
LEADMALE:You'll just have to spend another night, that's all.
LEADMALE:Good.
OTHERMALE:I guess it's time to hit the old coat rack, then.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mork, not the armoire.
SUPMALE:You're on Earth now you might as well start acting a little more like it, right? True.
LEADMALE:Where do you sleep? On a bed.
LEADMALE:Boy, have you got a lot to learn.
OTHERMALE:Good, I'll sleep with you.
LEADMALE:I'm always willing to learn.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just sleep on the sofa tonight? Oh.
SUPFEMALE:On a flat surface? Won't I get dizzy? Well, you won't have far to fall.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, could you go up in the attic for me and get the old comforter? Oh, kay-o.
SUPMALE:That's "okay.
SUPMALE:" You thank.
LEADFEMALE:"Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:" You're welcome.
SUPMALE:Oh, if you have any trouble finding it, it's in the middle of the attic behind the old trunk.
LEADFEMALE:Got it? MORK ( goofy voice ): Ah-bad nee-bay.
OTHERMALE:Bad-ah nee.
SUPFEMALE:Which one's the comforter? I do hope it's this one.
LEADMALE:See, my comforter doesn't stare.
SUPFEMALE:( chuckles ) Never mind, I'll get it later.
LEADMALE:Nice place, your attic.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice? It's dark, dusty and full of spiders.
SUPFEMALE:Blech! My kind of town.
OTHERFEMALE:It's perfect.
LEADMALE:Could I live there? You know, actually, that attic wouldn't be such a bad place if we fixed it up.
LEADMALE:You know, it would be like having your own apartment.
LEADMALE:And it would be a perfect place for you to stay while you're adjusting to Earth.
LEADFEMALE:It'd be perfect.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Except for Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:He and I are having enough problems as it is.
LEADFEMALE:Stay.
SUPMALE:Problems? Yeah.
SUPMALE:May I be of some assistance? I'm afraid not.
SUPFEMALE:You see you are the problem.
SUPFEMALE:Me? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy made me promise to have you moved out by tonight or else.
LEADMALE:Oh, I see.
LEADMALE:I didn't want to cause trouble.
LEADMALE:Well, I must be leaving.
SUPMALE:Well, where are you going? You can't go now it's cold out and it looks like rain.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'm into weather.
LEADMALE:I will miss you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, wait, wait, Mork.
LEADMALE:I don't want you to go.
LEADFEMALE:You see, until I met you, I I never realized how dull and boring my life has been.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, you're a man from outer space.
LEADMALE:That's exciting! Exciting.
LEADFEMALE:Oh ( screams ) I told you, stay! I've never been called exciting before.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you are.
LEADMALE:I mean, think of it you're a you're an ambassador from another planet.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you're important.
SUPMALE:And if I can help you, that ( laughs ) that makes me feel important.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the important thing is the relationship between you and your father.
LEADFEMALE:I envy you that you have one.
SUPMALE:My father was an eyedropper.
SUPFEMALE:My mother was a sterile dish.
LEADFEMALE:Hard to warm up to old Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but, Mork, it's time that I It's best for you if I leave, but I can come back from time to time and take human lessons from you.
SUPMALE:You're already acting more human than a lot of people I know.
OTHERFEMALE:I have a solution.
SUPMALE:What? I'll call your father and tell him I'm leaving.
LEADMALE:Oh What's his number? ( makes beeping sounds ) ( line ringing ) It's ringing.
LEADMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:McConnell, Mork here.
SUPMALE:No, sir, that's not quite right.
SUPMALE:I'm a son of a test tube.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, um I just want to say, uh, I don't want to stand between you and Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:No, you won't be seeing me anymore.
LEADMALE:I thought it'd be nice if you came over and made up with Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Good-bye.
LEADFEMALE:There are some words I have to ask you about.
OTHERFEMALE:He's coming over.
LEADFEMALE:I I'd better be going.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, I feel so sad.
LEADMALE:Oh Oh You're soft.
SUPFEMALE:I could get to like that.
LEADMALE:Well, you just can't just walk out.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, not just like that.
LEADFEMALE:I know we'll have a toast, uh, to your new life.
LEADFEMALE:I'll break out the bubbly.
LEADFEMALE:Bubbly? Champagne.
SUPMALE:( like Lawrence Welk ): Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, thank you, let's all get down, get funky.
LEADFEMALE:The lovely Lemmon Sisters gonna sing "I Can't Get No Satisfaction.
LEADFEMALE:" Except in this case, the champagne has to be ginger ale because that's all I have.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well here's to the nicest alien I've ever met.
LEADFEMALE:And here's to the nicest alien I've ever met.
LEADMALE:And the softest.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) ( goofy muttering and chuckling ) ( shrieks, goofy singing ) ( continues goofy singing ) ( raspberry ) ( yells like Tarzan ) ( goofy shout ) Are you all right? Certainly I'm all right.
LEADFEMALE:( goofy, childlike shouting ) Oh, wow! Surf's up! Ha-ha! ( slow motion ): Oh, no! What's the matter? I think I'm getting Bezurb.
LEADMALE:What? ( deep, wavering moan ): Oh, oh, oh, oh The carbonation hits my bloodstream and I get Ork-faced.
LEADFEMALE:( goofy singing ) ( shrieking ) Going home, Mama! Waah! You're drunk! Hey, don't take away my gusto! ( goofy shout ) ( like Wicked Witch ): Oh, help me, I'm melting! ( laughing ) ( goofy singing ) I can't believe this.
LEADMALE:I got to sober you up.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:( doorbell rings ) FRED ( calling ): Mindy I'll get it.
OTHERFEMALE:No! You've got to hide.
SUPMALE:Oh, Moo-moo No, you got to Shh, shh, shh.
LEADMALE:Woop.
OTHERMALE:Stairway to the stars! Shh! Oh uh Oh, hello, Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, honey.
SUPFEMALE:I hate to barge in like this, but Mork called, and I kind of got to thinking about the way I acted.
OTHERFEMALE:I was out of line, Mindy, and I want to apologize.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Daddy, you don't have to apologize.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to say another thing.
LEADMALE:Well, I know I didn't have to, but I wanted to.
LEADMALE:You know, it's not easy being a father, Mindy.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Someday you'll be a father you'll understand.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:( yawns ) Oh, I'm really getting bushed.
LEADFEMALE:It's getting late.
LEADMALE:I'd better get Oh, yeah, it's, uh, nearly 7:30? But, then again, it's not very often we get to have these little father-and-daughter talks.
LEADMALE:You know what I mean, Dad? Just sit down right over here.
LEADFEMALE:You know, honey, I'm sorry if I'm a little overprotective about you and your boyfriends, but this Mork, I mean, he's a yo-yo, he's some sort of a creature from outer space.
LEADMALE:Well, I know that's a strike against him, but he's really not that different.
LEADMALE:You should just take a, you know, a closer look at him sometime.
LEADMALE:Oh, is that so? Well, why don't you take a really close look ( screams ) Aw, bummer.
SUPFEMALE:What's he doing here?! Now, Daddy, don't get excited.
LEADMALE:I can explain.
LEADMALE:You lied to me! You broke your promise! ( growling ) Down, boy.
LEADFEMALE:Down.
LEADMALE:Heel, heel.
OTHERFEMALE:Sit! Sit! Well, I didn't break my promise, but you bullied me into that promise, you know.
LEADFEMALE:I bullied you into it? Well, I'm a father! What are fathers for? Well, you're just not gonna do it anymore, Dad, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:I'm 21 years old, I have my own apartment, I'm a grown woman, and if I feel like it, I'm going to keep an Orkan in my attic.
OTHERMALE:Well, I don't feel like it! So, in other words, what you're asking is that I choose between you and Mork? Right.
SUPFEMALE:Well, don't force me to make that choice, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:I'm forcing you.
LEADMALE:Mork stays.
LEADMALE:Good night, Daddy.
SUPMALE:Good night, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:( honks horn ) Moo-moo says hi, too.
SUPFEMALE:I'm warning you, if I leave here, I'm never coming back.
OTHERFEMALE:Never! If that's the way you feel.
LEADMALE:( door slamming ) On the other hand, never is much too long.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Oh Oh, good, you two are back together.
OTHERMALE:Mork, you're sober.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, we Orkans only stay bezurb for 60 seconds.
LEADMALE:Well, you were gone for a good five minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Whew! I was out for a long time.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Must've really hung one on.
OTHERMALE:You mean, he's still staying here tonight? Yes, Daddy, but nothing is going to happen.
LEADFEMALE:Do you believe that? Of course I do, honey.
LEADFEMALE:You gave me your word, and I trust you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:But I don't trust him.
LEADFEMALE:I'm staying the night.
LEADMALE:Oh, good company.
SUPMALE:Well, you can have my place, Pops and I'll camp out.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:( slow motion ): Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:( slower ): Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in Orson.
LEADFEMALE:ORSON: Orson to Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Am I coming in loud and clear? Uh, too loud, too clear.
SUPFEMALE:You're coming in fuzzy.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter with your head? Oh, I'm sending fuzzy.
LEADMALE:I think I got a little bezurb last night.
LEADMALE:You're supposed to be observing the planet, not running around getting Ork-faced.
SUPFEMALE:How's the sand holding out? I've been meaning to talk to you about that, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:I found a very safe place to put it a cat box.
LEADFEMALE:But that's a Yes.
LEADMALE:That's what it's worth here, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Haven't you found out anything important? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Believe it or not, trees are green on Earth.
SUPFEMALE:There's a black liquid that sells for three dollars a pound, and it takes two to tango.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, something really important.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Remember that girl I told you about? Yes.
OTHERMALE:Well, she did something very nice.
SUPFEMALE:She defended me against her father.
LEADMALE:That was a very brave and kind thing to do, and I don't know, I think I'm coming down with Feelings for her.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you know emotions are hazardous to your health.
SUPFEMALE:Don't start playing around with that stuff.
SUPMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:Not me.
SUPMALE:You can trust me, sir.
LEADFEMALE:This is Mork, signing off from Boulder, Colorado.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, I'm glad I didn't land in Buffalo.
LEADMALE:See you next week, sir.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.
SUPFEMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! Ow.
LEADMALE:Ow.
LEADFEMALE:Eer, ow, ooh.
LEADMALE:Ah, hah, hah.
LEADFEMALE:That's enough.
OTHERMALE:I'll tell you what you want to know.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe you.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you get haircuts on Ork? No, we try to avoid them because of the noggachomps.
LEADFEMALE:"Noggachomps"? What's that? It's a small green creature about this big.
LEADMALE:We put them on our heads and let them graze.
SUPMALE:They're vicious little animals.
SUPMALE:Kind of ( snarling ).
LEADFEMALE:That sounds dangerous.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, only if you fall asleep in the chair.
LEADMALE:Occasionally a maverick will get loose from the herd and run down your neck.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why we have to set traps in our shorts.
SUPMALE:What a horrible system.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, you don't understand Orkan philosophy.
LEADMALE:If something works, don't fix it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there, you look much better.
LEADMALE:Ah.
SUPMALE:You're all done.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, ah, I feels worse, though.
LEADMALE:How much do I owe you? Where did you get the money? I baby-sat for Eugene.
LEADMALE:Here, six big ones.
LEADMALE:Well, you just keep the money.
OTHERFEMALE:The haircut is on me.
LEADMALE:No, it's on me.
SUPMALE:( phone ringing ) Hello? Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Brad.
LEADMALE:( nasally ): Hi, there.
SUPMALE:How are you? Well, it's so nice to hear from you again.
SUPFEMALE:Nice to hear from you, too.
OTHERMALE:I thought you were in law school somewhere.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm out now Ow! Well, congratulations.
SUPFEMALE:No big deal.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh Here, go water yourself.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, sure, that would be fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'd love to have dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure.
OTHERMALE:All right, 7:30 it is.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, great, I'll see you then.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Mork, I have a date.
SUPFEMALE:Don't tell me June 2, 1852.
LEADFEMALE:No, I mean this guy that I really used to like is back in town and we're going to have dinner tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good, where are we going? "Where are we going?" Oh, boy.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you know I've been thinking.
SUPFEMALE:You and I have I think we've been seeing too much of each other lately.
OTHERMALE:Well, then all you have to do is close one eye.
LEADFEMALE:No, I mean, I think you should get out and meet more people.
LEADFEMALE:You know, see more things.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I get it.
LEADMALE:Two's company, "we's" a crowd.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:No, not that, necessarily.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, for your own development you really should get out and meet more people.
LEADMALE:Like who? Are you ready to start the inventory, Cora? Certainly, Fredzo.
SUPFEMALE:And don't call me Fredzo.
SUPMALE:It sounds like a detergent.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Now, let's see, there are one, two, three, four, five, six Meat Loaf albums.
LEADFEMALE:Six Meat Loaf.
SUPMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:One, two, three, four Nine Bread albums.
OTHERMALE:Nine Bread.
LEADMALE:This isn't an inventory.
SUPFEMALE:It's a grocery list.
LEADMALE:Hi, Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, hello, darling.
OTHERMALE:Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:How's the nicest, sweetest, most wonderful father in the world? Suspicious.
SUPFEMALE:Now you think I want something from you? Is that how little you think of your own daughter? Well, as a matter of fact, I have something for you.
LEADMALE:Two free tickets to tonight's basketball game.
LEADFEMALE:You're taking Mork.
SUPFEMALE:That's the nicest thing you've given me since the chicken pox.
LEADMALE:Fredzo, it's only 11:00.
SUPMALE:You're not usually a wiener before noon.
LEADFEMALE:See, Dad, I need Mork out of the house tonight.
LEADMALE:I have a date.
OTHERFEMALE:With a human? That's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, it won't be wonderful if he comes to pick me up at my place and finds Mork there.
LEADFEMALE:That's why you just have got to take him to that game.
OTHERMALE:But Mindy, I detest basketball.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, but Dad, I haven't had a date since Mork moved in.
LEADFEMALE:Every time the phone rings, I almost hope it's heavy breathing.
LEADMALE:I didn't hear that.
OTHERMALE:Basketball.
SUPFEMALE:How can anybody sit through a game that has so much dribbling? Well, if I can't date other men I guess I'll just have to settle down with Mork and have cute little green babies that drink their formula with their finger.
SUPMALE:Free throw! One-on-one! Jump shot! Dunk shot! I'll go! I'll go! MINDY: That was such a nice dinner, Brad.
LEADFEMALE:Here's to the old times.
SUPFEMALE:Here's to the new times.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Brad, can I ask you something kind of dumb? Sure.
SUPMALE:How come you never asked me out when we were in high school? Because I was a jerk.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you were.
SUPFEMALE:I wish I'd kept in touch with you, Mindy.
OTHERMALE:You're a wonderful girl.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I am.
LEADFEMALE:Greetings! Mork! ( humming ) What are you doing here? Dribbling.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, is this the guy you used to like? Mork, this is Brad Jackson.
SUPMALE:Brad, this is my friend Mork.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:I'm glad to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:Certainly.
LEADMALE:So is "Mork" your first or last name? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Did you enjoy having food with Mindy? Yes, I did.
SUPFEMALE:So do I.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody enjoys having food with Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:So, did the basketball game end early? I guess so.
LEADFEMALE:After about an hour, your father stopped it.
LEADMALE:My father stopped it? Yeah, he said, "This has gone on long enough.
SUPMALE:" Oh, Mork, what did you do? Oh, lots of things.
LEADMALE:I had a great time.
SUPFEMALE:Ever been to a basketball game? My favorite part was when I got to dance.
LEADMALE:You danced? Oh, yeah, that part at the beginning, where they played the music, everyone stood up and Oh, say can you see? He's a great kidder.
LEADMALE:Then some man asked me to pass him his coffee, so I did.
LEADFEMALE:He didn't catch it, though.
LEADMALE:That's too bad.
SUPMALE:But your father caught it with his pants.
LEADFEMALE:Then it was his turn to dance.
OTHERFEMALE:Then we went to a place called the rest room.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't get any rest there, though.
LEADFEMALE:I had a terrible seat.
LEADMALE:Couldn't even see the game.
LEADFEMALE:We went back and some woman asked me to hold her seat, so I.
LEADMALE:Never mind.
SUPFEMALE:I know, that's when they made us leave.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, are you a friend of the family? No, I live here.
LEADFEMALE:Live here? Oh, Brad, see, it's not what you think.
LEADMALE:Mindy, he lives here with you, and you go out with other men? Oh, yeah, but you see, uh Mork, Brad and I aren't quite finished yet.
SUPMALE:Oh, I see, you're still hungry.
LEADMALE:Mork I'll whip up my special dessert.
LEADMALE:No, Mork.
LEADMALE:Oh, for you, le monde, mama.
LEADMALE:( barks ) Stay.
LEADMALE:Maybe I should leave.
SUPMALE:No, Brad.
OTHERMALE:No, Brad, stay.
SUPMALE:We'd like to get to know you better.
LEADMALE:Mork.
SUPMALE:( Mork whistling, humming ) You see, Mork and I live together, but I still go out with whoever I want.
LEADMALE:I mean Mindy, I I don't know what your idea of a relationship is, but I-I'm not a swinger.
LEADFEMALE:Well, neither am I.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, swinger.
LEADMALE:Baseball.
OTHERFEMALE:( swishing sound ) How about them Broncos? Brad, I'd really like to see you again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we'll get together again.
LEADMALE:Soon.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, wait.
LEADMALE:You missed the bologna sundae.
SUPMALE:Your eyes are leaking.
LEADFEMALE:Are they? That means something has hurt you, doesn't it? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Brad did something, that slimemunger.
LEADMALE:I'll follow him to the ends of the universe.
OTHERMALE:I'll vaporize his entrails.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mork.
LEADMALE:It's not what Brad did.
LEADFEMALE:It's that Brad misunderstood our relationship.
SUPFEMALE:That's what made me sad.
LEADFEMALE:Ever since you moved in, guys have stopped asking me out.
OTHERFEMALE:And then when somebody does finally like me, like Brad, well He think that you and I are Lovelings.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:And then when I tell them we're not, they either don't understand or they don't believe the situation, so I end up not going anywhere, I never go out.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I'm feeling kind of lonely.
OTHERFEMALE:It's all because I'm staying here, isn't it? No, it's not your fault.
LEADMALE:It was my idea in the first place to have you move in.
LEADMALE:I just have to work this out.
SUPFEMALE:Night.
SUPFEMALE:( door closes ) Hm.
LEADMALE:Leaking.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mork, get up.
LEADFEMALE:Breakfast.
SUPMALE:What do you want, pancakes? Waffles? Gladiolas? Come on, you lazy Orkan.
LEADMALE:MORK: "Mindy, I know you are sad "because people think you and I are lovelings.
LEADFEMALE:"I don't want you to be sad anymore, "so I'm going away.
OTHERFEMALE:"If people from Ork knew how to love, "I'm sure I would love you.
OTHERFEMALE:"But I don't even understand what love is.
SUPMALE:Love, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:" You're doing that very well, Eugene.
LEADMALE:Grandma Hudson, thank you for letting me work today.
SUPFEMALE:I need the money so I can buy my mom a birthday present.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, that's all right, Eugene.
LEADMALE:What are you going to buy her? The best present in the whole world.
OTHERFEMALE:A catcher's mitt.
LEADMALE:Wow, that's great.
SUPFEMALE:And it'll go so well with those shin guards you gave her last year.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, say, Eugene, uh, call me if any customer comes in.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Guess who? Uh Stevie Wonder? What's happening, Mork?! Hey, plasma, what it is? What you doing with the suitcase? You taking a vacation? That's what I came to talk to you about.
SUPMALE:If you were taking a vacation, where would you go? I've always wanted to see France.
LEADFEMALE:Kay-o; dosvedanya.
LEADFEMALE:Or maybe the Swiss Alps.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, make up my mind.
SUPFEMALE:It depends on how much money you want to spend.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, six smackers.
LEADFEMALE:You can't go to the Alps with six dollars.
LEADFEMALE:Then France it is.
SUPFEMALE:Arrivederci.
SUPMALE:Or France, either.
OTHERMALE:Hey, bummer.
SUPFEMALE:Are you running away? How can you tell? It's written all over your face.
LEADFEMALE:Shazbot I've broken out in words.
LEADMALE:Psst.
LEADFEMALE:Can you keep a secret? I don't want you to tell Mindy where I'm going.
SUPMALE:You see, I've, I've been a lot of trouble to her.
LEADMALE:Man, you aren't going far on six dollars.
LEADMALE:You can't even get a place to sleep unless you stay in a flophouse.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds perfect for a flop like me.
SUPMALE:Well, there are some places on Mission Street.
LEADFEMALE:But they're awful seedy.
SUPMALE:"Seedy.
SUPMALE:" Oh, I love horticulture.
LEADMALE:Hello, Eugene.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:McConnell.
SUPMALE:What's this? Looks like a suitcase.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, somebody must have left it here.
SUPMALE:Maybe I better open it up and see if I can find the name of the owner.
SUPFEMALE:( making soft ray-gun sounds ) Good heavens! How did that happen? I don't know.
SUPMALE:( blowing ) I told you never to sit on my throne! I leave you two alone for five minutes, and the whole place goes to pot! You scoff? You don't believe? I tell you, the men from Venus are coming down to take us to their planet.
SUPFEMALE:They arrive Labor Day.
LEADFEMALE:Then they're going to blow up the whole world! And you sit there eating a sandwich? Where's the passenger list? There's only room on the escape ship for and so far we've lined up three.
LEADMALE:Pressure.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been walking the streets all day, trying to find recruits.
LEADFEMALE:My feet are killing me.
SUPFEMALE:Gad, those make my thighs sweat.
LEADMALE:Good-bye.
SUPFEMALE:I saw your signs outside the Friends of Venus? I thought I'd stop by to see if there's anyone here I know.
LEADMALE:Do you know any of the Friends of Venus? I know some people from Venus.
SUPFEMALE:I know one guy who's kind of cute if you're into short and fuzzy.
SUPFEMALE:His name is ( violent sniff ).
SUPFEMALE:Gesundheit.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, that's his name.
SUPMALE:See, he's got a wife and a litter, and their names are ( raspberry, squeak and cheeks flapping ) I'd hate to be the child stuck with a name like ( cheeks flapping ) A believer.
LEADFEMALE:A true believer.
LEADMALE:What's not to believe? You believe in people from outer space? Shazbot.
LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:Precisely.
LEADFEMALE:My name is Exidor.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like you to join me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if you insist.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I mean, join our group, be one of us.
SUPFEMALE:Us? Oh Well, right now, you see, I'm looking for a fliphouse to flap in.
SUPMALE:That's flophouse.
LEADMALE:Oh, flip, flop whatever.
OTHERMALE:You can stay here with us.
SUPMALE:We'll all work together.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, work.
SUPFEMALE:I finally got a job and a place to flip out all at once.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mindy will be proud of me.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy.
LEADMALE:Heavy sigh.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Daddy, Mork ran away.
SUPFEMALE:You've just got to help me find him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:well, look, honey, I don't know why he left, but maybe it's the best thing.
SUPFEMALE:No, it's not, Dad! Mork is like a child here.
SUPFEMALE:He shouldn't be out in the world alone.
LEADFEMALE:He has no concept of trouble or danger.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dad, if anything happened to him, ( sobbing ): I don't know what I'd do.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want him to go.
LEADMALE:All right honey, okay, take it easy, take it easy.
LEADMALE:Now, I'll help you find him.
LEADMALE:But where would he go? Oh, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I've been looking all morning.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, I just remembered something.
LEADMALE:This morning when I came in, there was a shiny metal suitcase right in the middle of the store.
SUPFEMALE:Mork has a shiny suitcase.
LEADFEMALE:And then the albums fell, and, and Eugene I don't know nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I think we've uncovered a clue.
LEADMALE:Mork, this is my philosophy for the Friends of Venus.
LEADMALE:I want you to study it and memorize it so that you can go out with me and convert the non-believer.
LEADMALE:I'll study hard and let you know when I'm ready.
SUPFEMALE:( high-pitched hiccup ) I'm ready.
LEADFEMALE:Very well, on your feet.
OTHERMALE:Uh let's pretend that, uh, I am a non-believer, and you try and convert me.
OTHERMALE:Hey, you, non-believer.
SUPFEMALE:Good start.
LEADMALE:But we need more power in your voice, and more conviction.
LEADMALE:Oh, I see.
OTHERFEMALE:Frey-und! I have need of your attention.
LEADMALE:Friend, do you realize that the Venusians are coming down to Earth? But they're not coming here on Veterans Day, not on April Fool-es Day, but on Labor Day, Labor Day, Labor Day.
OTHERMALE:Can you hear me, friend? I hear you! Are you ready now? Can I get a nanu-nanu? Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:Thank you, friend.
LEADFEMALE:Do you realize, friends, what they're coming here to do? Because they've come down here to blow the Earth to smithereens! But it's not that bad, friend.
SUPFEMALE:Because they're sending a ship down here to save 1,000 of us, and they're making a list, and they're checking it twice.
SUPMALE:Now, friend, now, you can either stay down here, in your disco, drug-infested inferno, or come up to Venus, and have your very own Venusian condominimum, with hot and cold running champagne and underwater dancing.
LEADMALE:You must apply now! Mork! Mork that was beautiful! Why can't you be more like him?! But there's something's missing.
LEADMALE:What we need is more of your experiences with the Venusians here on Earth.
SUPMALE:I didn't meet them on Earth; I met them on Venus.
LEADMALE:You've been there? Oh, yes, I've been to all the planets in your solar system.
LEADFEMALE:Mars, Mercury, Pluto?! Oh, don't ever go to Pluto; it's a Mickey Mouse planet.
SUPMALE:You see, Exidor, I have something to explain to you.
SUPFEMALE:The Venusians aren't coming to blow up the Earth.
OTHERMALE:They're not? No, you see, their technology isn't prepared for space travel.
SUPMALE:It isn't? No, their highest invention so far has been the garbage can.
SUPMALE:It is? And the only reason they invented that was to have something to tip over.
LEADFEMALE:Blasphemy! I had high hopes for you, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You're crazy.
LEADMALE:Mork! Oh, what a relief.
LEADMALE:Mindy, I didn't want you to find me here.
SUPMALE:You know, I knew as soon as I saw that Friends of Venus sign, I knew you'd be here.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to come home with me now.
OTHERMALE:No, you don't.
LEADFEMALE:You just say that 'cause you feel sorry for me.
LEADMALE:Mork, I don't feel sorry for you.
SUPMALE:I feel sorry for me.
LEADFEMALE:I don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:When I'm not there, you're free to do as you wish.
OTHERFEMALE:You have a home of your own.
LEADFEMALE:No, what I have is an apartment.
SUPMALE:It was only a home when there was somebody in it that I cared about.
LEADMALE:Me? But I get in your way; you told me so.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I know, and I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I was blaming you because guys stopped asking me out.
LEADFEMALE:And then when one did ask me out I know.
LEADFEMALE:I made a real crimluck of myself.
LEADFEMALE:It was my fault.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I'm a woman, and, and a woman just sometimes needs to be held.
SUPMALE:Mmm, that man Brad, you wanted him to hold you.
SUPMALE:Well, not him, necessarily.
LEADFEMALE:I really didn't get a chance to find out.
SUPFEMALE:But yeah, every once in a while a little hug really does help get me through the day.
SUPFEMALE:What's a hug? Oh, you know, like Like like this? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Soft.
LEADFEMALE:I can understand how this keeps you going.
LEADMALE:It's got me going, and I don't even know what it is.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:( humming ) Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Orson I am calling you-oo-oo ORSON: What a terrible connection.
SUPMALE:Sounds like someone stepped on a frenkle's tail.
OTHERMALE:Just me reporting from Earth.
LEADFEMALE:And what words of wisdom are you transmitting across the universe today? I learned how to make a human happy.
LEADFEMALE:I learned how to give a hug.
LEADFEMALE:And a hug is? It's when you wrap your arms around a human's body and squeeze.
OTHERMALE:I thought that's what Earthlings call wrestling.
SUPFEMALE:No, in wrestling, you squeeze a lot harder until they sweat and go "Arrgh!" They don't sweat and go ( grunting ) when you hug them? No, they just cuddle and go "Ah!" Oh, hugging.
LEADMALE:Amazing what pleases the primitive tribes.
LEADMALE:I'll never understand them.
OTHERMALE:But Orson? Yes? It was good for me, too.
OTHERMALE:Mork! Yes, Your Immenseness.
SUPFEMALE:This is Mork, signing off from Boulder, Colorado, until next week.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
OTHERFEMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! ( uniform makes gurgling sounds ) ( gurgling sounds ) Babalu, Mindy.
SUPMALE:( sighs ) Hi, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, am I glad you're home.
SUPFEMALE:Could you do me a little favor? Of course.
SUPMALE:Uh, would you put away your space suit? Oh, sure.
OTHERMALE:( gurgling ) Ah, space suit, good to see you.
LEADMALE:( gurgling happily ) Ah.
SUPMALE:Oh, of course I miss you.
LEADFEMALE:( gurgling ) Yes, yes.
OTHERMALE:You see, I have to wear Earth clothing now that I'm here on Earth.
OTHERMALE:( gurgles ) It's true.
LEADMALE:Mork, you talk to your space suit? Of course.
LEADMALE:It spoke first.
LEADFEMALE:I'd be rude not to reply.
SUPFEMALE:( speaking Orkan ) ( gurgling ) But you're treating it like it's alive.
LEADMALE:It is.
SUPFEMALE:It's made up of billions of tiny living cells.
LEADMALE:( sniffs ) Whew! If you call that living.
LEADFEMALE:( gurgling ) I'm sorry you know it's true.
SUPMALE:You smell bad.
LEADMALE:( gurgling ) You see, you earthlings are in a primitive state, but you'll realize that life exists in many forms throughout the universe when you gain higher intelligence and more sophistication.
SUPMALE:( in baby talk ): Time for dodo num-nums, okay? ( gurgling ) What? ( gurgling ) No, I can't tell you a story tonight, so you just hang in there.
LEADFEMALE:( suit gurgling ) Ne-ne.
OTHERFEMALE:I know it's probably my fault.
SUPFEMALE:Spare the rod and spoil the suit.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, how'd your observation of traffic go today? Oh, not very well.
SUPFEMALE:Why do they call it rush hour when nothing moves? Got me.
SUPMALE:I had to go to a movie instead.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you did? What'd you see? Oh, it was a love story called Here Comes the Fleet.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, I love that one.
LEADMALE:I'd like to see that one again.
LEADMALE:So would I.
LEADFEMALE:I have several questions I'd like to ask you about it, if you don't mind.
OTHERMALE:Oh, go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:You remember Biff and Margie? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:You remember when they first met, they had this horrible fight, and then the very next scene, they were together on a date again.
SUPMALE:Why? Because they were falling in love.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I see.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, sucker's hot.
SUPMALE:But there's one small thing I don't understand.
LEADMALE:Hmm? What is this thing called "love"? You don't know? I know it's an emotion, but we abolished emotions on Ork a billion bleems ago.
SUPFEMALE:They took a vote, and everyone said, "All in favor?" ( buzzes ) Well, Mork, if you want to be an earthling, you're just going to have to experience love.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Does this love lead to mating? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good, because I've been wanting to try that.
LEADFEMALE:When can we start? When can we start? Oh, wow.
SUPMALE:DÃ©jÃ  vu.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, you see, we can have a mating, and I can send back a report to Orson complete with slides, video demonstrations Oh Oh.
OTHERMALE:See, see, Mork, it doesn't quite work like that.
LEADFEMALE:See, um mating I mean, love When a man and a woman really care about each other, then ( suit gurgling ) Mindy, my suit needs me.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be right back.
OTHERMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:We'll discuss this love another time.
LEADMALE:Fine with me.
LEADMALE:Your suit really got me off the hook.
OTHERMALE:Oh, humor.
LEADMALE:( honks ) What is it? ( gurgling ) Why didn't you think about this before you went to bed? ( Hare Krishnas singing ) I'd give them money if they'd just learn another song.
LEADMALE:Cora, well, it does my heart good to see you tending to my inspired little window display.
LEADMALE:Has she attracted many customers yet today? Customers, no.
SUPMALE:Dust, yes.
OTHERMALE:And I'll tell you another thing, Fredzo.
LEADFEMALE:I'm getting a little tired of picking dead flies out of her wig.
LEADMALE:Have your little joke, Cora.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing you can say or do is going to upset me today.
OTHERFEMALE:Life is wonderful, life is sweet, and I am thrilled to be alive.
LEADFEMALE:Cool it.
LEADMALE:You're bringing me down.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if that's your attitude, I'm going to bring you down some more.
SUPMALE:Cora what could I have that would say, "Here is a man who is a success"? A sign saying, "Here is a man who is a success.
SUPFEMALE:" Wrong.
SUPMALE:Driving a brand-new Cadillac.
OTHERFEMALE:That says a man is a success.
LEADFEMALE:Mm, well, it doesn't say much for you.
LEADFEMALE:You drive a '69 compact.
LEADMALE:Not after today.
OTHERMALE:I have scrimped, and I have saved, but it was worth it.
SUPFEMALE:I've got $2,300 in here, and that gives me just enough to swing the deal.
LEADFEMALE:Here, look.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't it a beauty? Now, why do you need a car three blocks long when you only live a block and a half away? Well, I don't need the car to drive to work.
SUPMALE:I need the car to drive to my high school class reunion this Saturday night, and that's 53 miles from here.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you hated high school.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, no, no, I didn't hate high school.
LEADFEMALE:I hated Forrest Collins.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Because he was big, because he was a bully, and because he said I'd never amount to anything.
LEADFEMALE:You know it's strange, but Elizabeth never told me any of this.
LEADFEMALE:Well, because I never told her.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, I never told anybody about it until now.
SUPMALE:But look, that's behind me.
SUPMALE:I've saved my money, and I'm getting my Cadillac, and there is nothing that anybody can say that can stand in the way of my happiness.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Daddy! Except that.
LEADMALE:"Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:" ( groans ) Hello, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:Hello, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Hudson.
LEADFEMALE:Where's Mindy? Well, she's out on an errand, but she should be back soon.
SUPMALE:Oh, a wingless hibenginie.
LEADMALE:I thought they were extinct.
LEADFEMALE:Guess they are.
SUPMALE:Stiff city.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Hudson.
OTHERFEMALE:Hmm? May I ask you something very personal? Shoot.
LEADMALE:How do you know when you meet the person you'll fall in love with? Oh, Mork, I promise you, when you meet the right one, you'll know it.
SUPMALE:And you knew the minute you met Mr.
LEADMALE:Hudson? Oh, yes.
OTHERMALE:It took 15 years for us to realize it was love at first sight.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you're going to need these while you're waiting for Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good, snacks.
OTHERMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No, they're, uh they're to make the music sound better.
LEADFEMALE:That's illogical how can anything sound better by putting cotton in your ears? You'll see.
LEADFEMALE:( violin paying off-key ) ( shouting ): I understand you now! MINDY: Please be here.
SUPMALE:Oh, please, please, please, please be here.
LEADMALE:Oh, good! Oh, no! Oh, darn it.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy! Oh, hi, Mork.
SUPMALE:Ooh, heavy vibrations.
LEADFEMALE:Early sensor reading says anxiety, depression, state of defunk.
LEADFEMALE:What seems to be the matter? Oh, I'm just disappointed in the mail.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, then let me teach you something.
OTHERFEMALE:You see, it's common throughout the universe for the female of the species to be disappointed in the male.
LEADMALE:The nimnul factor's omnipresent, and they can be such beasts sometimes.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mork, you don't understand.
SUPMALE:I was expecting a special letter.
LEADMALE:Oh, let me give you one.
SUPMALE:How 'bout "K"? Maybe an "F" or a "U"? Oh, Mork I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to cheer you up.
LEADFEMALE:It's not going to help.
SUPFEMALE:See, Mork, I never finished college because I didn't really know what I wanted to do.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but now I know I want to go back and go on and get my degree in Journalism, and I'd applied for this scholarship, and I was just turned down, and now I can't go back What are you doing? Making a fool out of myself.
LEADFEMALE:I understand that's common in light of what's happened.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ) I took your advice, and this afternoon, I went out, and I fell in love.
OTHERMALE:What?! Oh, she's beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:The first time our eyes met I knew I knew it was the real thing.
LEADFEMALE:You see, I'm madly ( laughs, shrieks ) I am madly in love.
LEADMALE:Mork, you can't fall madly in love with someone you just met.
LEADFEMALE:Love takes time.
SUPMALE:No, you won't say that after you meet Dolly.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Well, certainly, I'd like to meet her sometime.
LEADMALE:Oh, no time like the present.
SUPFEMALE:She's out in the hall.
LEADFEMALE:Can I bring her in, huh, can I, can I, huh, can I? Of course.
SUPMALE:I mean, you shouldn't have left her standing out there alone.
OTHERMALE:Oh! Shh.
LEADMALE:Mindy meet Dolly! ( tango music playing ) ( turns off music ) You dance divinely, my darling.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to sit down.
LEADFEMALE:I have to have a little talk with the both of you.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, uh Oh, just sit down.
LEADFEMALE:After you first, my dear.
SUPFEMALE:There we go.
OTHERMALE:Relax.
LEADMALE:( snapping sound ) Now, I don't know how else to say this but to just come right out with it.
LEADMALE:You can't have a meaningful relationship with a mannequin.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? She's beautiful, shy, quiet.
LEADMALE:Of course she's quiet, she can't even talk.
SUPMALE:Oh, haven't you heard of body language? My darling, whoa, oh, oh, oh.
LEADMALE:I love it when she talks dirty like that.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you can't love an inanimate object.
LEADMALE:Why not, you say you love your book.
LEADMALE:That's different.
LEADMALE:And you said you loved Here Comes the Fleet.
SUPMALE:That's different, too.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't my love for Dolly different? That's too different.
LEADMALE:That's what I love about her.
LEADMALE:She's unique, one of a kind.
LEADFEMALE:That's what makes her wonderful, isn't it? Oh, Mork, yes, I think she's just wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:Now look, so far my day has been pretty rotten.
SUPFEMALE:Now I'd like to stay here and talk to you two, but I have some problems of my own to work out, so I think I'll just leave.
LEADFEMALE:You have a good time.
LEADFEMALE:We will.
LEADMALE:At last we're alone, cara mia.
OTHERFEMALE:What shall we do tonight, my love? Hmm? Maybe we can go to the Balalaika, that quaint gypsy restaurant and ask for Bella, our favorite waiter, and he'll give us a booth near the oyster bar.
LEADMALE:I'd sit near the fireplace, but I know that it bums you out very much.
SUPFEMALE:Then afterwards we'll wander down the street, look in store windows, see if there's anyone there you know.
OTHERFEMALE:We can go dancing, my love.
LEADFEMALE:I know you don't like to dance.
SUPMALE:You feel a little stiff sometimes, but I have a better idea, cara mia.
LEADFEMALE:Come, stand up in your own special way.
LEADMALE:Yes, I'll tell you what ( snapping ) No, no.
SUPMALE:Let me sweep you off your feet, my love.
LEADFEMALE:Let me show you some old Roebuck catalogs now, come.
SUPMALE:We're going up to my attic.
SUPFEMALE:I'd like to show you some of my special drawings.
SUPMALE:A special romantic interlude, just you, Mu-mu and me.
LEADMALE:Upstairs we go, my love.
LEADMALE:( thuds ) Oops.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:Don't tell me, you've got a headache now, don't you? I don't get it.
OTHERMALE:What kind of a ding-dong would take a mannequin from a store window? Well, what kind of a ding-dong would put it there in the first place? I'm not going to let it upset me.
LEADFEMALE:Today is Fredrick C.
OTHERMALE:McConnell's big day.
LEADFEMALE:Today I become a success.
LEADMALE:In one hour, I pick up my brand-new Cadillac.
LEADMALE:If that's what makes you happy, have fun.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, dear.
OTHERMALE:What's wrong? I guess I'm not very good at hiding my feelings, am I? No, not unless you're secretly happy.
SUPMALE:Honey, honey, what's the matter? Oh, Daddy, I wanted to surprise you.
LEADFEMALE:I was going to go back to college.
LEADFEMALE:College? Honey, that's wonder "Was"? That's just it.
SUPMALE:I was hoping for a scholarship, only they canceled the program, and I didn't get it.
SUPMALE:And I can't afford the tuition.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm so sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Well This is kind of a a dream of yours? Yeah, I guess it is.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I know what that's like.
LEADMALE:How much money did you need? Well, the scholarship was for about $2,000.
LEADFEMALE:$2,000? That's an interesting figure.
LEADMALE:That's that's too interesting for my bankbook.
SUPMALE:Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, is today your lucky day.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you were gonna surprise me, now I'm gonna surprise you.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, ever since you were a little baby, I've been putting aside a little money for you.
LEADMALE:I was gonna save it until you needed it and ( sighs ) well, it looks like you need it now.
LEADMALE:What? There's $2,300 in there.
LEADFEMALE:I wish it could be more.
LEADFEMALE:( gasps ) God, I wish it could be more.
SUPMALE:This is incredible.
SUPMALE:I'll second that.
LEADMALE:Oh, Daddy.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Daddy, you're wonderful.
LEADMALE:I can't believe this.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm going to go down right now and sign up.
LEADMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, I'll talk to you guys later.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks again, Dad.
SUPMALE:Eh, Frederick.
OTHERFEMALE:You just did a wonderful thing, and I'm really hacked off about it.
LEADFEMALE:What? Well, just when I convince myself that you're an absolute wiener, you turn around and turn around and do something nice.
SUPMALE:Did you see the look on Mindy's face? I mean, anybody that can make another human being look like that, he's gotta be a success.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now I can go to my high school class reunion and hold my head up in my old car if it starts.
SUPMALE:And so I thought you ought to know that's what he really was saving the money for.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't believe him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know.
SUPFEMALE:Sometimes he acts like a BB stacker, but but underneath, dear, your father's really a a good guy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I know.
SUPMALE:Well, I'll just have to give him that money back.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, no, don't you dare do that.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, you made him very happy today.
OTHERMALE:More than a new car ever could.
SUPFEMALE:And if you want to make me happy, don't you ever dare tell him that I spilled the beans.
SUPMALE:Why? Well, you see, way down I know that your father really loves me, and I don't want to do anything to ruin our rotten relationship.
SUPMALE:Good night, Mork.
LEADMALE:Good night.
OTHERFEMALE:Good night, darling.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, Grams.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, but I find this all rather puzzling.
OTHERMALE:Oh, well, it's just another side of love, Mork.
SUPMALE:A father's love for his daughter.
SUPMALE:He sacrifices Oh, I know that.
SUPMALE:I read Lolita.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ) But it's the other love that complicates things.
LEADFEMALE:What other love? Well, his love for her.
SUPMALE:You see, he calls her bad names, he tries to avoid her, but yet he still loves her? See, Mork, Dad and Grandma need each other.
SUPMALE:And that's what love is all about.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's just like my love for Dolly.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Mork, I don't know about the rest of the universe, but here on Earth there's a big difference between a living woman and a mannequin.
LEADMALE:Really? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Go get Dolly.
LEADMALE:I want to show you something.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I'll have to wake her up.
SUPFEMALE:She had a headache so I put her in the guest room.
SUPMALE:My love.
LEADFEMALE:( gurgling sounds ) Get your sleeve off her, you! ( gurgling ) Come, my sweet.
LEADMALE:Ah, there we go.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, now I want you to hold Dolly's hand.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm, nice.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I want you to hold my hand.
OTHERMALE:Oh, even nicer, and the fingers separate.
OTHERMALE:Okay, now I want you to hug Dolly.
OTHERMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:( falsetto ): Help me.
SUPMALE:Help me.
SUPFEMALE:Not bad.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, now I want you to give me a hug.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:That's very, very nice.
LEADMALE:And no dead flies either.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, now I want you to give Dolly a kiss.
SUPMALE:Just like in the movies? Just like in the movies.
SUPFEMALE:( Mindy laughing ) Now it's your turn, right? Well, yeah.
LEADMALE:It's all right.
LEADFEMALE:Do you see the difference? Whoa.
SUPFEMALE:Aah, aah, aah, aah.
LEADMALE:( laughing ) Genetic memory.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa, primitive stirrings deep inside.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
SUPMALE:Amrak.
SUPMALE:Crazen.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, baby.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh, I I think I understand.
LEADMALE:The for-real human being is much better than a plaster replica.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Mindy, can we be alone for a moment? We are alone.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Dolly and me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure.
SUPMALE:I understand, I think.
LEADMALE:Um, I have a few things that I could pick up at the store, anyway, so you two be alone.
LEADFEMALE:( humming ) Dolly? Dolly, darling.
LEADFEMALE:We have to have a little talk.
SUPMALE:That's all right.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I love you because you're such a good listener.
SUPFEMALE:Dolly? Why are you staring off into space like that? I guess you know what's coming.
LEADFEMALE:I You better kinda lay back for a second.
LEADFEMALE:( snapping ) We're different, dear, and I come from a planet where there are no emotions, and all of a sudden I met you and, "zingo," I felt something.
LEADFEMALE:It was like ( nonsense sounds ) I guess as you humans say, "I'll stop bushing around the beat.
SUPMALE:" Um, dear, I when I first met you, I found you very special, the way you the way you're so straight and yet, friendly, and the way your ankles turn around, kinda like backwards like that.
SUPMALE:Kinda like Linda Blair and, I I don't know, darling, I ( voice cracks ): it just isn't going to work.
LEADMALE:You're too good for me.
LEADFEMALE:I know, I know.
SUPFEMALE:Well, look at it this way.
LEADFEMALE:Someday you'll meet the mannequin of your dreams, and you're no dummy, Doll I know, no offense.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:So all I can say to you, my love, it's it's over.
OTHERMALE:I, um, I'll miss you.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, don't no, you can't cry.
LEADMALE:Take care.
SUPFEMALE:I'll drop by and look in on you, and I'll miss you, love.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, don't pass out on me.
OTHERFEMALE:Guess this means farewell forever, my love.
LEADFEMALE:( snapping ) Oh.
LEADMALE:You didn't have to give the ring back.
LEADMALE:MORK: Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:This is Orson.
LEADMALE:What's the matter with you? Me? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:You've got a strange look on your face.
SUPMALE:Maybe it's love.
LEADFEMALE:Love? Isn't that an emotion? It's a many splendored thing.
LEADMALE:It makes the world go round.
LEADMALE:It'll keep us together.
LEADMALE:It's all you need.
SUPMALE:All I need is a report that makes sense.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Love doesn't make sense.
SUPFEMALE:That's why earthlings think it's so wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:Is there anything similar to it on Ork? No.
OTHERFEMALE:What happens is you get hot and sweaty.
LEADMALE:You can't eat, you can't sleep, and you feel dizzy all the time.
OTHERMALE:It sounds like that disease you got on Venus.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, Venusian's Revenge.
SUPMALE:We Orkans made the right decision in giving up emotions.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not so sure, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:You see, we may have given up too much.
SUPFEMALE:Even though I'm more advanced than these humans, sometimes I I feel so primitive, ( snickers ) I'm afraid I don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:Neither do I, Orson, but I'm not afraid.
LEADFEMALE:This is Mork signing off till next week.
OTHERFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Nanu, nanu.
LEADFEMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot.
LEADMALE:( opening musical theme plays ) There.
SUPMALE:Mork, I'm leaving now.
LEADMALE:I'll be right down.
SUPFEMALE:( singing Orkan song in squeaky voice ) I'm ready! Let's go! Ah, where do you think you're going dressed like that? I'm going to the shower with you.
LEADMALE:But Mork, this is a bridal shower for a girl who's about to get married.
OTHERMALE:Oh, on Ork, when we get married, they don't give them a shower, they just hose them down.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you don't understand.
SUPMALE:A shower is another word for a party.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, we'd better take an umbrella, then, because I heard on the radio that it's going to be cloudy with scattered parties.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Mork, but you can't go with me.
SUPMALE:See, this is just for women.
SUPMALE:Men aren't allowed.
LEADFEMALE:But I want to be with you.
SUPMALE:And I want to be with you, too.
LEADFEMALE:But, you know, you really should get out and meet more friends.
OTHERMALE:You need to broaden your horizons and grow as a person.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you're rejecting me because I'm short.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm not rejecting you.
LEADFEMALE:But it's just not fair that I go out tonight; you have to stay here all alone.
SUPMALE:Remember, you can learn something from everybody you meet here on Earth.
LEADFEMALE:That's very true.
LEADFEMALE:The garbage men today taught me to never lie on the curb on pickup day.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, what were you doing lying on the curb? Well, I was watching some ants mug a grasshopper when he came by.
OTHERMALE:And I suppose you're going to tell me that the garbage man picked you up and threw you into the truck? No, he said he couldn't do that unless I was tied and bundled.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, this is all very interesting, but the point is that you need to go out and meet other people.
SUPMALE:I don't know how to do that.
LEADFEMALE:Just be friendly.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you mean like this? Hi, friends, Sal Worthless here, Worthless Motors.
LEADFEMALE:I'll eat the chrome off a trailer hitch just to get me in my parking lot.
LEADFEMALE:Let's all react.
SUPFEMALE:This is my wife Spot and my dog Chuck.
LEADMALE:No, it's my dog Chuck and my wife Spot.
LEADMALE:If you believe that, you'll buy this watch.
LEADFEMALE:We're just squealing to make you a good deal.
LEADMALE:You don't have to put on an act.
SUPMALE:Just be yourself.
SUPFEMALE:( in squeaky voice ): Gizbah, funmeega.
LEADFEMALE:Put on an act.
LEADFEMALE:And put on your clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, everybody.
OTHERMALE:FRED: Oh, good morning, honey! Did you enjoy yourself at that shower last night? Well, it was really kind of different.
LEADMALE:Beth said that she and Jim are going to take separate honeymoons.
SUPFEMALE:Separate honeymoons? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:They've been living together so long, they need a little time alone.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, dear, where's Mork this morning? Oh, he's out in the neighborhood making new friends.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, well, there goes the neighborhood.
OTHERFEMALE:( laughing ) Why don't you just admit it, Daddy, I know you like him.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I'd sooner be tied to an amplifier at a Grateful Dead concert.
LEADFEMALE:That can be arranged.
LEADMALE:Oh, excuse me, do you have Neil Diamond? Only in my dreams.
LEADMALE:Susan? Susan Taylor! I don't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy! Mindy McConnel! I haven't seen you in three years.
LEADMALE:What are you doing dressed like that? What do you mean? Aren't you a nun? What? Me? Whatever would give you that idea? Oh, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Uh Peace Corps.
LEADFEMALE:Airline stewardess? Oh, come on, I know it was one of those unselfish professions.
SUPMALE:No, I was never going to do any of those things.
SUPMALE:Oh, what a shame.
LEADFEMALE:You would have made such a sweet nun.
SUPMALE:You always were so sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thanks, but I work here now.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, it must be so exciting working in a music store, selling the instruments and sorting the sheet music and dusting off whatever.
LEADFEMALE:Susan, you aren't still mad at me because of Jack, are you? Jack? Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack.
SUPMALE:Oh, you must mean Jack Peterson.
LEADMALE:That devastatingly handsome captain of the football team that you stole behind my back.
OTHERMALE:Who is now president of the National Bank of Boulder and wanted to marry me and by now would have given me a $200,000 home, and the possibility of high regard in the community.
LEADMALE:That's the one.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, I never gave that a second thought.
LEADFEMALE:So, what have you been doing since graduation? Oh, nothing much.
SUPFEMALE:I was a little depressed about Jack, so Susan, I never went after Jack.
SUPMALE:He's the one who chased me.
SUPMALE:Mindy, dear, you'll just have to help your father with the inventory.
LEADMALE:I have a bad case of wiener fatigue.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Susan, don't go away.
LEADFEMALE:I want to talk to you later.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Would you like to be my friend for life? What's your name? Bug off, creep.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Mork.
LEADFEMALE:May I just call you Bug Off? Nanu, nanu.
LEADMALE:How'd you like a knuckle sandwich? Sorry, I don't eat meat.
LEADFEMALE:Is there anything I could do for you? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Get out of my sight.
LEADMALE:Oh, hide-and-seek.
LEADFEMALE:I know how to play that game.
LEADMALE:( counting in Orkan ) Infinity! Here I come! Boy, he's good.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa you're a very interesting specimen.
LEADMALE:What's your name? Bug off.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, dÃ©jÃ vu, I just met your brother.
LEADMALE:Why don't you take a hike? Oh, football.
OTHERMALE:I know that one! We got a good ball game, it's gonna be a good ball club.
SUPFEMALE:( shouting gibberish ) ( speaking in slow motion ) I got it, baby! I got aah! I'm in the zone! I'm in the zone! ( whistles loudly ) I know.
LEADMALE:It's too much craziness.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:This is a music store, you see, not Mile-High Stadium.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Hudson.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know where Mindy is? Yeah, she's in back.
LEADMALE:She'll be out in a few minutes.
LEADFEMALE:( singing in silly voice ) I didn't realize you were a friend of Mindy's.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes.
OTHERMALE:We live together.
LEADMALE:Oh, really.
SUPMALE:That's interesting.
LEADMALE:I'm Susan Taylor.
LEADMALE:I'm Mork.
LEADMALE:Nanu, nanu.
LEADMALE:Whatever.
LEADMALE:Oh, are you a friend of Mindy's, too? Oh, yes, yes, from way back.
LEADMALE:Well, since we're both friends of Mindy's, why can't we be friends together? Oh, Mork, I think that's a wonderful idea.
LEADMALE:We should be friends.
LEADMALE:Close friends.
SUPFEMALE:As a matter of fact, I think we should celebrate by going out tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Kay-o.
LEADFEMALE:You want to pick me up? If you insist.
LEADMALE:Is that what you do on a date? Yeah, well, whatever turns you on.
LEADFEMALE:That did.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, so, what-what do you drive, Mork? Oh, a Grembo Pasati.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, marvelous.
OTHERMALE:Is that a foreign car? Oh, not where I come from.
LEADFEMALE:I bought it from Gezo Geb.
LEADFEMALE:( singing jingle in Orkan ) It's been in the shop for three bleems.
LEADMALE:That's okay.
SUPFEMALE:We can use my car.
SUPFEMALE:Um, tell me, where do you live? Oh, one-six, one-nine, Pine Street.
SUPMALE:It's just a hop, skip and a churnel from here.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:I'll pick you up at 8:00.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi.
SUPMALE:Mindy, you'd be real proud of me.
LEADFEMALE:I made a friend right here in the store.
OTHERFEMALE:You did? What's his name? Oh, it's a she.
SUPMALE:It's a human specimen named Susan.
LEADFEMALE:When she found out we were living together, she wanted to be my friend real bad.
LEADMALE:( chuckling ): I'll bet she did.
LEADFEMALE:In high school, Susan had a habit of collecting friends Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Other people's friends.
LEADMALE:Oh, she sounds real friendly then.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, that's the game she plays.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that and football, and I'll see you after the game.
SUPFEMALE:Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rock 'em.
SUPFEMALE:Get that ball and really fight! Mork, what are you doing in there? You've been in that bathroom for over an hour.
LEADMALE:MORK: Taking the worry out of being close.
LEADMALE:Well, you'd better take the worry out of being late because Susan's going to be here any minute.
LEADMALE:( singing in Orkan ) Whoa! Mayday! Mayday! Volgar the Enforcer! Over there! Mork, what are you doing? The sacred flame is burning.
LEADMALE:It's a candle and it's burning because I just lit it.
LEADMALE:Wait, wait.
SUPMALE:You're safe.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:Phew! Phew! What a relief.
LEADMALE:I was scared Orkless.
SUPMALE:Why? On Ork, when the sacred flame is lit, it means that Volgar is coming to torture you.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you Orkans had done away with violence.
LEADFEMALE:Violence, yes; torture, no.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, there's no such thing as nonviolent torture, except for The Gong Show.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Volgar is even more terrifying than Chuck Barris.
LEADFEMALE:What they do is, they march you up to the Sacred Kraal, and then Oh, no, no, it's too terrifying to even think about it.
LEADFEMALE:They stretch you out and they tickle you by candlelight.
SUPMALE:Thank God it's never happened to you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, a few guys have tried, but Oh, that means that Volgar is coming, it's terrifying.
LEADMALE:The mere thought of it, well, it makes me laugh.
SUPMALE:Ha! No, shh.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, why would they want to torture you? You see, before I got this assignment, I got a speeding ticket from the Stellar Patrol.
LEADMALE:They said I was going the speed of light in a speed of sound zone.
SUPMALE:I would have stopped but I didn't hear the siren until after they arrested me.
LEADMALE:What happened, didn't you pay the ticket? Well, Orson said he fixed it, but I'm still terrified of hearing ( imitating siren blaring ) Yeah, I'd be a little worried if I heard that too.
SUPFEMALE:Right, it means that Volgar is coming and it strikes terror into the hearts of jaywalkers, speeders and those who tell jokes.
LEADFEMALE:Telling a joke is a crime on Ork? Only if it gets a laugh.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, I'd really like it if you came along with me tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, group therapy is fine.
LEADFEMALE:Group dates I am not into.
OTHERFEMALE:But I need you.
SUPFEMALE:I need your advice.
LEADFEMALE:Just be polite.
OTHERMALE:Be a gentleman.
SUPFEMALE:Pull out her chair.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, practical jokes.
SUPFEMALE:Onk! No, no, that's not what I mean.
OTHERMALE:Oh, see, wrong again.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I need you.
LEADMALE:I have no need to sit through an entire evening with you and Susan.
LEADMALE:Oh, I see.
LEADFEMALE:Jealousy rears its ugly head.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ) Me, jealous of plain old Susan? Boy, that's a laugh.
SUPFEMALE:( doorbell rings ) First of all, I'm not the jealous type, and secondly, what's to be jealous of? Susan.
LEADFEMALE:May I come in? Oh, sure.
LEADFEMALE:You look, uh, different.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:I took a bath.
LEADFEMALE:Did you? He's such a kidder.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Mork's never serious.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy, I hope you don't mind that Mork and I are going out tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, of course not.
LEADFEMALE:Mork can do whatever he wants.
OTHERFEMALE:That's so sweet of you.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess we should be going.
SUPMALE:Plain, old Susan.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy, it's just such a shame that have to stay here all alone.
LEADMALE:Oh, well.
LEADMALE:I asked her to come along, but she said she didn't want to go.
LEADMALE:Well, oh, if you insist, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and Susan, you and I have so much to catch up on.
OTHERFEMALE:( playing aria from Carmen ) Fred.
OTHERMALE:Fred! What's the matter with you? I haven't seen you so happy since the Beatles broke up.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it isn't every day I gain a daughter and lose a Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Fred.
LEADMALE:Huh? Huh? Fred! Fred, what makes you think they're going to split up? Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Mindy told me what happened last night, and apparently Mork wants to see a lot more of Susan.
LEADMALE:CORA: Why, hello, kids.
SUPMALE:Well, hello.
SUPMALE:Did you have a good time on your date last night, Mork? Yes.
SUPMALE:We went to a big parking lot with a giant TV in the front.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:How did you like the movie? I didn't watch the movie.
SUPFEMALE:Aha.
LEADFEMALE:MINDY: He was too busy looking at all the cars.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how do you know that? Because I sat between them.
LEADMALE:But why? Because I couldn't get Susan to sit in the back seat.
SUPMALE:It didn't matter, though.
OTHERMALE:I didn't see anything.
SUPMALE:All the car windows were steamed up.
SUPMALE:Gosh, I'd hate to count up all the car windows I've steamed up in my day.
OTHERMALE:( phone ringing ) I'll get that.
LEADFEMALE:McConnell's Music.
LEADMALE:Oh, hello, Susan.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, he's here.
SUPMALE:Just a minute.
LEADMALE:It's your girlfriend.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Susan.
LEADMALE:Whoa, oh ( mumbling ) Yeah, she's gone now.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckling ): Oh, yes, whoa Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I'll tell her.
SUPMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Ciao, arrivederci, chelan delecito.
SUPMALE:Mindy, Yes.
LEADMALE:Susan asked me over for dinner, but she said to tell you that she only has enough food for two.
OTHERMALE:That's the most insulting thing I ever heard.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, can I borrow some money to buy her some flowers? No, that's the most insulting thing I ever heard.
LEADMALE:How can you as a self-respecting human being? Uh, whatever.
SUPFEMALE:How can you, how can you dare to borrow money from my daughter to take out her friend who is only trying to steal you away from her, and obviously wants to get her hooks into you Is $20 enough? ( doorbell rings ) Coming.
LEADMALE:( doorbell rings ) Hello, Mork.
LEADMALE:Good-bye.
LEADFEMALE:I brought you some presents.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Here's five dollars.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, but I already have one.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Then here's some vegetation.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:( sneezes ) Oh, you ( sneezes ) You're welcome.
OTHERMALE:Mindy picked them out.
LEADMALE:Yes, well, I'm, I'm allergic to daisies.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, she must have forgotten.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet.
LEADFEMALE:Well, tell me, Mork, uh, what do you and Mindy talk about when you're all alone together? Lots of things.
LEADFEMALE:I tell her everything.
SUPFEMALE:Hmm, well, she'll just love hearing about what happens tonight.
LEADMALE:Are you two, uh, very close? Oh, yes; sometimes we stand right next to each other.
SUPMALE:Ah, well, that's very interesting.
LEADMALE:I, I think I'd like a little wine.
LEADMALE:All right, if you insist.
LEADFEMALE:( whining ) I'll get the bottle.
SUPMALE:Oh Susan has a pet.
OTHERMALE:Long tongue.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and well-trained.
LEADMALE:So, tell me, what do you do with your days? Oh, today I went to see a cowboy movie.
LEADFEMALE:( cowboy drawl ): Jeb, I hate to say this, but I'm in love with your buffalo.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Would you open the wine? Oh, yes, ma'am.
OTHERFEMALE:If there's some trail dust that has to be washed out, I'll get right at it.
SUPMALE:What are you doing?! It's open.
SUPFEMALE:Look at this mess.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I, I'd better head back to Mindy.
LEADMALE:Uh, no, no, no, no, Mork, that's all right.
LEADMALE:Uh, I, I can get a new dress.
LEADMALE:And a new sofa.
SUPFEMALE:And a new rug.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, why don't we just change the mood a little? Oh, that reminds me of a joke.
LEADFEMALE:These two Venusians walk into a bar.
LEADFEMALE:One says to the other, "Ee-vizbah.
SUPMALE:" The other one replies, "Arg, nimnull, arg.
OTHERMALE:" I guess you've heard it.
SUPMALE:The other one is, how many Martians does it take to screw in a light bulb? Oh does the name Volgar mean anything to you? This is no time to joke.
LEADFEMALE:Just stretch out and relax.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no! You're not going to stretch me out in your Kraal! ( cuckoo clock strikes eight times ) Waah! Volgar the Enforcer! Oh you're not going to tickle me not at least alive! ( shouting frantically in Orkan ) ( babbling continues ) Whoop! Too late! Oh, you're crazy! Hey, you're crazy if you think you're going to let Volgar tickle me here.
LEADFEMALE:( shrieking ) All right, now, stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! No! No! Don't tickle me! Don't tickle me! Don't tickle me! Ahh!! Mindy! Mindy.
SUPMALE:Mork, I didn't hear you come in.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Shall I go back out and come in noisier? Do whatever you want.
LEADFEMALE:Kay-o.
SUPMALE:( tromping footsteps ) ( door squeaking sounds ) ( squawking ) ( shoes squeaking sounds ) You want to hear about my date? Oh I know what you're doing.
LEADMALE:It's called the silent treatment.
LEADMALE:We used to have it on our planet, but we banned it because we thought it was an earthy thing to do.
OTHERFEMALE:So, how was your dinner? I don't know.
LEADMALE:We didn't get to eat.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it looks like you were too busy doing other things.
SUPMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADFEMALE:Ring around the collar.
OTHERMALE:Mork, do you think I'm jealous? Why should I be jealous? What you and Susan do on your date has nothing to do with me, and that's that.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you want to hear what happened? Down to the last sordid detail.
OTHERMALE:All right, here's the Reader's Digest version.
OTHERFEMALE:Ding dong.
LEADFEMALE:Here's some flowers.
LEADMALE:( in falsetto ): Thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:( pretend sneeze ) ( falsetto ): I'd like a little wine.
SUPMALE:( whining ) ( singing in Orkan ) Long tongue, whoop, homing instinct.
LEADFEMALE:( speaking Orkan ) Da-da-da-da-da-da.
LEADMALE:( falsetto ): Would you open it? ( regular voice ): Sure.
OTHERMALE:Psshh! Ahh! ( sputters ) Oh, no! Whoa, do you know anyone named Volgar? ( falsetto ): Ah, no, no, ah! ( regular voice ): No, whoa, ah General destruction.
LEADMALE:Ah, I can see it right now blood, death, everything.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, don't tickle me, don't tickle me, don't tickle me! That's what happened.
SUPFEMALE:Oh Oh, Mork, I'm so sorry your date didn't go well.
LEADFEMALE:It didn't? Well I guess it wasn't a total loss.
OTHERFEMALE:At least you learned something from it.
LEADMALE:You know, I learned something about myself tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Like what? I didn't want to admit it, but I was jealous.
OTHERFEMALE:Why? I don't know.
LEADMALE:You and I are We're best friends.
SUPMALE:You know, we're buddies.
LEADFEMALE:We're pals.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I think I understand.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy What? I'd like to kiss my pal.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, pulse.
LEADFEMALE:Rapid heartbeat.
LEADMALE:Temperature rising.
OTHERFEMALE:I get it! What did you get? I think I know what made those car windows steam up at the drive-in.
LEADMALE:( mimics remote zapping ) Ah Well, you want to watch television? ( crickets chirping ) Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Orson to Mork.
LEADMALE:Orson to Mork.
SUPMALE:Orson to Mork.
OTHERMALE:Orson to Mork! Well, have you made any new discoveries on Earth? Yes, sir.
SUPMALE:This week I met a new female specimen.
LEADFEMALE:Whew! MORK: Her name is Susan.
LEADMALE:And she tried to kiss me.
SUPMALE:ORSON: Why? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:It's an old Earth custom practiced frequently by lovers, relatives and talk show guests.
LEADMALE:Did you kiss her? No.
SUPMALE:I wanted to kiss my pal.
LEADMALE:Good thinking, Mork.
SUPMALE:ORSON: Wait just a grindle! Isn't that the girl Mindy? That's my pal.
LEADFEMALE:Your life is starting to sound like a real soap opera, Mork.
LEADMALE:Just remember, your mission is to report objectively about life on Earth.
LEADFEMALE:Don't get involved! You can count on me, Your Immenseness.
LEADFEMALE:I'd be the last one on Earth to get involved.
LEADMALE:( sighing ) Oh, this is Mork, signing off from Boulder, Colorado.
LEADMALE:See you next week, Mindy.
SUPMALE:I mean, I mean Morson.
SUPFEMALE:Whew! An-nu.
OTHERMALE:An-nu.
SUPMALE:Whoa.
SUPMALE:( self-conscious laugh ) Mmm oh.
LEADMALE:Ciao.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! Oh.
SUPFEMALE:I'm hungry.
LEADMALE:I wish Frederick would get back from lunch.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:How could he leave us at the height of our rush hour? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:CORA: Oh, say! Business is picking up.
LEADFEMALE:That last couple came to a full stop.
SUPFEMALE:( playing harmonica ) Do me my shazbow di din daz bow doe Mork, what are you doing? Singing the Orkan blues.
SUPFEMALE:Going to nanu all night long Oh, say, I like that.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know the "No Sales Blues"? MINDY: Come on, you guys.
LEADFEMALE:Stop fooling around.
OTHERMALE:I really feel sorry for Dad.
LEADFEMALE:So do I.
LEADFEMALE:( groans ) Why do we feel sorry for Dad? Business is the pits.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and on top of that, the water pipe broke in his house and flooded the entire living room.
LEADMALE:That's too bad, because the wet look is out.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, but it's no fun trying to wring out a wet couch.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and it cost almost $3,000 to repair the plumbing and dry out all the furniture.
LEADMALE:Say, Mindy, do you know where those invoices are for the records? Oh, yeah, we ran out, but there's more in the back.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADMALE:I'll show you where they are.
SUPMALE:Hey, Mork, could you kind of watch the store while we're back there? Whoa! Oh! Like to buy a record? No, I'm just kind of browsing.
LEADFEMALE:Great luck.
LEADFEMALE:Let's all hear the special deal new from Rotel Marcel Marceau's Greatest Hits.
SUPFEMALE:Who can ever forget "Man Ascending an Escalator"? How's it go? "Man Walking the World's Longest Staircase.
LEADFEMALE:" There he goes, walking across it now.
LEADFEMALE:Also, let's just forget the vinyl, and look inside, see the other quite exciting values you can get free with this.
SUPMALE:Look, it can be a hand glove, also can dice, slice, and make julienne fries.
LEADFEMALE:It can also be a party favor, a King Tut hat.
SUPFEMALE:Who knew? Also a puppet for a two-dimensional child.
SUPFEMALE:"Hi, Mom, nice to have you home.
LEADMALE:" These and many more can be yours for only $1.
SUPMALE:99.
LEADMALE:Offer void where prohibited by good taste.
LEADMALE:( chuckling ) You are one funny guy, with loads of energy, pal.
LEADMALE:But you know, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
SUPFEMALE:Do you, uh ( clears throat ) know one Mindy McConnell? I know one.
LEADMALE:Are there more? ( clears throat ) Well this one's 21, brunette, and lives at 1619 Pine Street.
SUPFEMALE:Uh uh, excuse me, but who are you, and how do you know who I am? Well I, uh, saw the, uh, front of the store that said "McConnell's Music Store," and ( clears throat ): well, he, uh, told me your name.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't mention her name.
LEADMALE:Well, you implied it.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooh, a psychic.
SUPMALE:Well, how do you know where I live? Well, it was kind of a hunch.
LEADFEMALE:Could you excuse me for just a moment? ( clears throat ) Here's the deal I'm actually from the Boulder Evening Sun.
LEADFEMALE:Clint Mullet, ace reporter.
LEADMALE:You don't act too much like a reporter.
SUPMALE:Well, actually, I'm just Clint Mullett, ace copy boy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, copy boy, a clone! I'm working on a story so big no other reporter would touch it.
OTHERMALE:It's the biggest cover-up since the Greenbrier Scandal.
LEADFEMALE:I never heard of that.
LEADFEMALE:You see? My editor was so scared when he saw my first few pages, he threw the whole story in the trash.
LEADMALE:How does Mindy fit into your trash? Good question, boy.
LEADMALE:All right, it seems that a few months ago, you were up at Boulder Lake with one Bill Mason.
LEADFEMALE:How do you know that? Did you see anything unusual that night? Like what? Well, UFOs? Oh, what? You know, flying saucers? Flying saucers.
SUPFEMALE:( honking bark ) You don't believe in them, do you? You don't? No, I'm into flying eggs.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Flying saucers, don't make me laugh.
OTHERMALE:( laughing ) ( honking bark ) Now, look, 12 people in your area reported seeing glowing flying saucers.
LEADFEMALE:Now, it was a dark night.
LEADFEMALE:My question is, why didn't you see any glowing objects? Mindy, these are the wrong invoices.
LEADMALE:Um, all right, Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:What was your name again? Uh, Clint Mullet, the next Lou Grant.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, it was really nice getting to know you, and if I remember that I saw a flying saucer, I will let you know.
SUPFEMALE:Tell you what, save some coffee for Tuesday, all right? Right.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, that was a close call.
SUPMALE:CORA: Mindy! I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:( half-whispers ): I knew it.
LEADFEMALE:I sensed it, I felt it.
SUPFEMALE:She knows something.
LEADFEMALE:She knows something.
LEADFEMALE:She knows a lot of things.
LEADFEMALE:She watches Rona Barrett.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Did she ever talk to you about a strange creature from another planet? About one, no.
LEADMALE:You know, I'm into aliens.
LEADMALE:You like science fiction? Hey, sci-fi's my life.
LEADMALE:It is? Did you ever read Tales of the Milky Way? I skimmed right through it.
LEADFEMALE:And you talk about these kind of things with Mindy? Sure thing.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you and I have got a lot in common.
OTHERMALE:We ought to get together, have some lunch Talk about outer space, alien beings Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:Does this mean we're going to be friends? Oh, you betcha, pal.
LEADFEMALE:You know, if my theory is right, there's probably an alien right here in Boulder.
SUPMALE:So, be on the lookout for anything strange or unusual.
LEADFEMALE:You bet.
SUPMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:Do you realize what a close call that was? Guess what? Clint wants to be my friend.
LEADMALE:Are you crazy?! Of course he wants to be your friend.
SUPMALE:You're the one he wants.
SUPFEMALE:I know that, but there's an old Orkan phrase "The best place to hide from the enemy is right under his noses.
LEADFEMALE:" Oh, but Mork Mork, what if he finds out that you? ( humming ) Uh that you don't read the Boulder Evening Sun? Then he won't be my friend? He might not.
LEADFEMALE:Then I better run out and buy a copy right now.
OTHERMALE:Hello! Oh, that boy really wigs me out.
SUPMALE:( laughs ) I love him.
LEADMALE:What's the matter, dear? Is something wrong? Well, there was this crazy reporter in here, and he thinks that men have landed from outer space.
LEADFEMALE:And he thinks that I know something about it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! Of all the crazy wieners.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, now, don't you worry, dear.
SUPFEMALE:If he comes back again, I'll kick him right in his Sunday supplement.
LEADFEMALE:( horns honking ) ( tires screeching ) ( horns honking ) Oh! Wow, it's a lucky day.
SUPMALE:Mindy, look! ( screams ) What happened? He almost got hit by a bus.
SUPMALE:Mork, you should know better than to walk out into the street before looking.
LEADFEMALE:If you hadn't pulled me out from in front of that bus, I'd be dead meat right now at Boot Hill.
LEADMALE:Well, Mork, it was no big deal.
LEADFEMALE:I just happened to be there.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you.

LEADFEMALE:Anything, just lea What funeral? The one for the chair I zapped.
SUPFEMALE:My Chippendale chair.
LEADMALE:Good grief, man, why did you zap my chair? Mercy killing its leg was broken.
SUPMALE:But that chair was a hundred years old.

LEADMALE:I have to have my trombone.
SUPFEMALE:See, trombone Oh Foot bone's connected to the ankle bone Ankle bone's connected to the shin bone Shin bone Uh, trombone, yeah! ( playing melody ) ( notes fading ) Mork, please leave me alone.
OTHERMALE:But you saved my life.
LEADFEMALE:I owe you everything.
LEADFEMALE:But anybody would have pulled you out from in front of that bus.
LEADMALE:Not on my planet.
SUPMALE:You see, no one would even care.
LEADFEMALE:They don't even have emotions on my planet.
LEADMALE:What's it like, not having any emotions? Well, it's a real bummer.
LEADMALE:But being with you makes me happy.
LEADMALE:( phone rings ) I'll get it! Oh, no, no, no! No, I'll get it.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, no Ah too late! I'm there! Daddy's residence.

LEADMALE:Mork, they've asked me to conduct an orchestra for money.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:That's great news.
SUPMALE:I have some even greater news.
LEADMALE:Hmm? Remember how this trombone used to slide? Well, I fixed it so this sucker will never slip on you again.
SUPMALE:Out.
LEADFEMALE:Out! Is there anything else I can do for you? Wax your violin? Hose down your organ? Out! ( clinks ) ( clinking ) Aah, aah! ( yells ) ( honking bark ) Great game.

LEADMALE:( sighs ): It's you.
LEADMALE:It's M Mork.
LEADMALE:Mork! Mork, how did you get in here? Well, I saw you come up through the ladder, so I hid.
SUPMALE:Tag, you're it.
LEADFEMALE:You're toying with me, aren't you? You can see right through me.
LEADMALE:No, you're opaque.
LEADMALE:Come here, Mork.
LEADMALE:Listen, Mork, I'm convinced that Mindy knows something about these UFO sightings.
LEADMALE:So, I'm over here snooping around for some clues.
LEADMALE:Clues? Like what? Well, you know, Mork, a clue could be anything, you know? It could be big, it could be small But it takes a trained eye to spot a real clue, my friend.
SUPMALE:Sometimes, they can even be right under your nose.
LEADMALE:I have the same theory.
SUPFEMALE:No kidding.
LEADMALE:Well, one day, you may be an investigative reporter like me.
LEADMALE:For instance, what's this? Oh, I Looks like some kind of folder, doesn't it? Yeah.
SUPMALE:And there's something written on it, too.

LEADMALE:Oh, uh hi, uh, Clint.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, Mindy.
SUPMALE:This is my father, Frederick.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Dad, this is the reporter I was telling you about.
LEADMALE:I have evidence here that leads me to believe that Mindy knows an alien the leader of a planet Orch? Uh-oh, confusion, fear, look of cold terror.
LEADMALE:Yes, it's right here.
LEADMALE:It says it uh "Orch Leader.
LEADFEMALE:" I don't believe it.
LEADMALE:This is my father's music.
OTHERFEMALE:That's O-R-C-H Orch.
SUPMALE:It's an abbreviation for "orchestra leader.
LEADMALE:" It's music for the local high school.
SUPMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Clint, you lose again.
LEADMALE:Better start all over again and come through the window.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, you came through my window? Did you break in here? Not actually All right now, buddy.
SUPFEMALE:You've gone over the line.
LEADMALE:I'm calling the cops.
OTHERFEMALE:Cops! I know that game.
LEADFEMALE:Freeze! Nobody move! ( imitates static ) and one Caucasian male.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? This is an emergency.
SUPMALE:Some man has just broken into my apartment.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he broke into my apartment, and he's here right now Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Hang on just a second.
OTHERFEMALE:What's this? Uh, never mind.
SUPFEMALE:Uh This looks to me like some kind of space helmet.
LEADFEMALE:Space helmet! Does this look like a space helmet? This is my planter.
SUPMALE:Well it doesn't look like a planter to me.
SUPFEMALE:Now look, you're starting to get on my nerves.
SUPFEMALE:So, why don't you just leave my apartment, and I don't ever want to see you around here again.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, just a second.
LEADFEMALE:Hang on everybody, okay? I've got a little admission to make.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, now, you're all familiar with the newspaper The American Inquirer? Good.
LEADMALE:Well they're offering a $25,000 reward for proof that there's an alien being living on Earth.
LEADMALE:Now, here's the proposition.
LEADMALE:Listen close.
LEADFEMALE:I'll give you the money.
LEADMALE:All I want is exclusive rights to the story.
LEADMALE:All I want is the fame.
OTHERMALE:Tell you what.
LEADMALE:All you have to do is get me proof that there's an alien being here on Earth, and the money's yours.
LEADFEMALE:FRED: Who ever thought I'd be guest conductor for a high school band? ( giggles ) Well, who knows? Maybe somebody will hear me and see me, and hire me to conduct some real music, huh? Yeah, wouldn't it be nice? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I know you could use the extra money.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I sure could use that $25,000 reward.
LEADFEMALE:Dad! Oh, honey, honey, don't worry.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't turn Mork in.
SUPFEMALE:I have to admit, that's an awful lot of money.
LEADMALE:I don't even know what I'd do with that much.
LEADMALE:I know what I'd do.
LEADMALE:I'd pay off the plumbing bills, and I'd still have enough left over to get the store back on its feet, or at least on its knees.
LEADMALE:Yeah, having that much money sure would be nice.
LEADMALE:Well, it's pointless to even think about it.
SUPFEMALE:We can't turn Mork in.
LEADMALE:I know, I know.
LEADMALE:We just have to be happy with what we are and what we have.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess I'd better get home and help Cora with the clarinet parts.
LEADMALE:It's going to be a long night.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll go with you and help out.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, honey, you've done enough, as it is.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't even worry about it, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:If I help, you two can get to bed a lot sooner.
SUPMALE:Hey, Mork, I'm going to go over to Dad's for awhile, so I'll see you later.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:See you.
SUPMALE:Well, it is getting late, so I think I'll hit the road.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, honey.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I'll see you tomorrow, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Night.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh! Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Uh what are you doing here? I've thought it over, and I think I'll turn myself in for that reward.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why would you want to do a crazy thing like that? So I can give you the money.
LEADFEMALE:What? Well, see, I have to pay you back.
SUPMALE:Mindy's my friend, and especially you, because you saved my life.
SUPMALE:And I know you need the money really badly.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mork, everybody needs money.
LEADMALE:That's right.
OTHERMALE:You don't have to do a thing like that.
LEADMALE:Well, I want you to be able to go back to college full time, and I want you to be able to put your business back on its knees again.
LEADMALE:Mork Mork, that's very generous of you, but you don't know what kind of a price you'd have to pay.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, you just don't know what they'd do to you.
LEADFEMALE:Your life wouldn't be your own anymore.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, I have an idea.
LEADMALE:They'd make me a celebrity, movies Oh, eventually I'd end up on Hollywood Squares in a box.
OTHERFEMALE:( imitates Paul Lynde ): Disgusting! Yeah, and that's just the good part.
LEADMALE:Really? Yeah, you wouldn't have any privacy anymore.
SUPMALE:I mean, just think, little children will be following you around, saying, "Nanu-nanu.
SUPFEMALE:" Yes, and adults will be walking up and saying, Shazbut.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, if and if they only knew what that meant.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! I mean, think about it! They'd come out with dolls, games! Oh, it could be awful! It would be like living in a zoo! They may stick you in a bottle.
LEADFEMALE:A bottle.
LEADMALE:My grandfather was a bottle, and he died a broken man.
LEADFEMALE:You know, there's a chance, too, that we would never see you again.
LEADMALE:They make you invisible? No, but they'll take you away.
LEADMALE:Oh, looks like my future is no bed of raisins.
LEADFEMALE:I want to help my friends, but I don't know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:Whew, I got to think this one under.
SUPFEMALE:CORA: Frederick! Cora! What's the matter? Somebody better call for a plumber.
SUPFEMALE:And I'll go back and start bailing.
OTHERMALE:Well, that settles it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, Mork, tell the plumber to come here right away, that it's an emergency.
SUPFEMALE:( beeping ) Hello, Clint? Mork here.
LEADMALE:If you want to see a real live alien being, be at Mindy's house at noon tomorrow.
OTHERMALE:Be there or be square.
LEADMALE:'Bye.
LEADMALE:Now, what's the number of the plumber? ( knocking ) MORK: Come in.
LEADMALE:Mork, where are you? I'm up here.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right down.
LEADMALE:Where is he? Where is the alien? He's getting dressed.
SUPFEMALE:What a day for mankind.
SUPFEMALE:What an event in the history of the universe.
LEADFEMALE:What a break for my career.
LEADFEMALE:I can see it now.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be in Washington two years from now.
LEADFEMALE:The President, he'll call me.
LEADFEMALE:"Clint, we need you, you're a good man.
OTHERFEMALE:" ( imitates fanfare ) I am Mork, from Ork, sent by my superiors to observe your primitive civilization and report back.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
SUPMALE:You called me here for this? Red pajamas and silver boots? You look like a reject from the O'Jays.
SUPMALE:But I'm a member of a superior civilization, really.
LEADMALE:Mork, come on, I know you need the money, but Wait! I can prove it.
LEADFEMALE:Watch.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll make that plant rise into the air.
SUPMALE:( whistling ) ( crash ) Butterfinger.
LEADFEMALE:I don't perform well under pressure.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, this is silly.
LEADMALE:I'm splitting.
LEADFEMALE:This is ridiculous.
SUPMALE:Wait! How many people do you know that can drink with their finger? I'm sorry about this.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get back to you.
OTHERFEMALE:( whistling ) ( whistling trails off ) Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:( burps ) How did you do that? Greetings.
LEADMALE:I am Mindy, Catwoman from Mars.
LEADMALE:( meows ) Mindy, what are you doing? I was sent here to observe your primitive planet.
LEADMALE:But that's my job.
LEADMALE:Listen, I'm the only alien here.
OTHERMALE:MINDY: Of course you're an alien.
LEADMALE:I'm an alien.
SUPMALE:We're all aliens.
OTHERFEMALE:I am Fredzo from Scherzo! Somehow, I feel alienated.
OTHERMALE:I have been sent down here to observe your primitive society and demonstrate my great powers.
LEADFEMALE:Here, pick a card, any card.
SUPMALE:Clint, I don't know how to tell you this, but they're jiving your socks off.
LEADMALE:Who else could do this? Watch this pitcher.
LEADFEMALE:( high-pitched whistling ) How do you like them eagles? Big deal.
LEADMALE:Move aside, boys.
LEADFEMALE:Watch this.
LEADMALE:( humming ) Did you see that? Just a second.
LEADMALE:Hang on just a second.
LEADFEMALE:There's a wire here.
LEADFEMALE:This whole thing is rigged.
LEADMALE:Oh well, Mork, he found us out.
LEADMALE:Shazbut! Shazbut! Look, I just want to say that, uh, you are the most unconvincing group of aliens I have ever seen in my life.
LEADMALE:And, uh, Mork, you are the worst.
SUPFEMALE:The next time you try and impersonate an alien, why don't you just leave the pajamas home? I refuse to be made a fool of.
SUPFEMALE:Too late.
LEADMALE:It's a real space suit.
OTHERFEMALE:I paid 50 trivets for this in New Ork.
SUPFEMALE:Now you'll never get the money you need for the store.
SUPMALE:Well, we won't get it from finking on you.
SUPMALE:We've been down before, but we'll get out.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we always have before.
LEADMALE:Anyway, Mork, I don't want to lose you.
LEADFEMALE:And besides I've grown accustomed to your honk! Why did you do that, when you needed the money so really badly? Oh, you don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you're more important than any amount of money.
LEADMALE:You can't buy friendship.
OTHERFEMALE:So, even if I had turned myself in, it would have been for nothing.
OTHERMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:And you saved me from that.
LEADMALE:Well yes.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you ( muttering ) thank you, thank you Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson! ORSON: I hear you, Mork.
OTHERMALE:Whoa! What are we going to talk about this week? Believe it or not, Your Immenseness, my value on the Earth market is $25,000, or 100 yen.
LEADFEMALE:How much is that in grebbles? Oh, a measly 0.
LEADMALE:3.
SUPMALE:Money seems to be important to Earthlings.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you bet your sweet shobow.
LEADMALE:They put it in a place called a "bank.
LEADFEMALE:" What happens at a bank? Well, you bring in your money.
SUPMALE:It meets other money, mates, and makes more money.
LEADMALE:Also, this money seems to have a certain rubber-like quality, because you can bounce a check, or stretch a dollar.
LEADFEMALE:Can anyone get money from the bank? No, only the rich, and those with proper identification.
SUPMALE:Also, a bank will only lend you money to buy a boat, or a big car, not to buy food.
OTHERMALE:Why is that? I guess food's harder to repossess.
LEADMALE:We will store that information, Mork, even though it's from you.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Your Immenseness.
SUPMALE:By the way, don't take any wooden grebbles.
LEADFEMALE:This is Mork, signing off until next week.
SUPFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.
SUPFEMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! ( sings musical tones from Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind ) ( speaking Orkan ) Return to mother ship.
OTHERFEMALE:( beeps ) Sanctuary.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, shells.
SUPFEMALE:All I hear is sugar.
LEADMALE:( speaking Orkan ) I won't hurt you if you tell me where the others are hiding.
LEADMALE:( speaking Orkan ) ( squealing ) Whoa Good morning.
LEADFEMALE:Morning.
LEADFEMALE:How's your Danish? ( with accent ): Yeah, sure, it's coming along fine now but right now, it sounds a lot like Swedish.
SUPFEMALE:I mean the rolls.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, it's late.
OTHERFEMALE:I got to get to work.
LEADMALE:Why are you wearing that rubber coat? Oh, this is a raincoat.
SUPFEMALE:It keeps my clothes dry.
LEADMALE:Why not leave your clothes here and go out naked? I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:I never know when I might have to demonstrate the accordion.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, humor.
LEADFEMALE:( honking bark ) You don't have to worry, though.
LEADMALE:It's not going to rain today.
LEADFEMALE:Well, sure it is.
OTHERFEMALE:I just heard it on the radio.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, we Orkans are very sensitive to the positive and negative ion ratio in the air ( beeps ) and the ion ratio today tells me ( beeps ) sunny and clear.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure? The ion ratio ( beeps ) would not lie to you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it never has before.
SUPMALE:Okay, you win.
LEADMALE:You mind if I go to the store with you today? I'm observing the leader of the dogs.
SUPFEMALE:What leader of the dogs? The red leader in front of the store: the short one with the four bumps that hangs around the curb.
LEADMALE:Oh that's a fire hydrant.
LEADFEMALE:That's not the leader of the dogs.
LEADFEMALE:Then why do they all salute him? I'll explain it on the way.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:( jackhammer pounding ) Grandma, why are they tearing up the concrete outside? ( humming ) Grandma.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll save her.
SUPMALE:They'll never harm you again.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thank you for, uh, saving my life.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'll need the earmuffs again to tune out that jackhammer concerto outside.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, we noticed the workmen installing a hole.
OTHERMALE:How can you miss it? You have to be a broad jumper to get into the store.
LEADMALE:It's a good thing I'm wearing my orthopedic sneakers.
SUPFEMALE:You know, it's freezing in here.
SUPMALE:Yeah, it's colder than a witch-digger's brass monkey.
LEADFEMALE:Is our rotten landlord trying to break the lease again? Why? He hasn't even finished breaking the sidewalk yet.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mork, what's happening? Give me some skin.
LEADFEMALE:Eh Nanu-nanu.
SUPFEMALE:Neva.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah ( both buzzing ) What it is, what it was And what it shall be.
LEADFEMALE:Right on.
LEADMALE:Hey, where'd the great pile of dirt come from? I think it came with the hole.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Eugene, it's time for your violin lesson.
SUPMALE:But it's too cold to practice in here.
OTHERMALE:Honey, the way you play, you can leave your mittens on and nobody will know the difference.
SUPMALE:What if my fingers freeze, and I can't play anymore? Your parents will send me a thank you note.
LEADMALE:Now quit stalling, Eugene.
OTHERMALE:Get in there, you jive turkey.
SUPMALE:Keep cool, mama Keep cool, mama.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, hello there.
LEADMALE:Well, Dad, the landlord is at it again.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I know.
LEADMALE:I just came through the obstacle course out front.
LEADFEMALE:There's a ten-foot hole out there.
SUPMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:Somebody's going to get killed.
OTHERFEMALE:Arnold Wanker doesn't seem to understand we have another two years left on our lease.
LEADFEMALE:FRED: And you don't seem to understand that if Arnold Wanker can kick us out, he can lease this space to the restaurant next door and double the rent.
LEADFEMALE:Shazbot! Electric Danish.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you wearing your raincoat today? Oh, it's going to rain.
LEADFEMALE:I heard it on the radio.
OTHERMALE:It's not going to rain.
OTHERMALE:Can't you feel the ion ratio? Now we're cooking.
LEADMALE:Get down.
OTHERFEMALE:Get back up again.
LEADMALE:Can't I hear the ion ratio? Ah you've been talking to Trash Gordon again.
LEADMALE:His name is Mork, and he happens to be able to understand a lot of things we can't even comprehend yet.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, apparently.
SUPMALE:He's dancing to a sound effects record.
LEADMALE:( imitating airplanes soaring ) ( imitating bombs exploding ) Wow, bummer.
SUPMALE:Um excuse me.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Why is it so cold in here? Arnold Wanker is trying to freeze us out.
LEADMALE:Now, this has got to be the dirtiest trick he's ever played.
LEADMALE:Uh, no, no, no.
SUPMALE:The worst thing he ever did was in sixth grade.
SUPFEMALE:He came out to the baseball field and he gave us all the free lemonade we could drink.
SUPMALE:( honking bark ) That's not funny.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Then we found out he'd put a padlock on the only bathroom.
LEADMALE:It cost me two weeks' allowance to buy the key from him.
LEADFEMALE:Now that's funny.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, oh, ah.
SUPMALE:Confusion.
SUPFEMALE:Heavy sigh.
LEADFEMALE:I better be going.
SUPMALE:Charming family you have.
SUPMALE:Take care of them.
LEADMALE:Well strung.
SUPFEMALE:See you at lunch, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Are you going to be all right? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:My project for today is to go to the park and observe how pigeons train old people to feed them.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Eugene is on automatic pilot.
SUPMALE:It was either leave the room or put on my earmuffs again.
SUPMALE:Dad was just telling me what a rotten kid Arnold Wanker used to be.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, dreadful.
SUPFEMALE:I baby-sat him when he was five, and he blackmailed me for all my baby-sitting money.
SUPMALE:Did he catch you necking with your boyfriend on the couch? No.
LEADMALE:That would've only cost me half the money.
LEADFEMALE:Half the money? Grandma, what were you doing? Uh, she was probably supplying illegal drugs to Civil War soldiers.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, why don't you go sit on your Schubert.
OTHERFEMALE:Mindy, dear, I think we ought to lay in a couple dozen of this disco album.
LEADFEMALE:It's number 18 with a bullet.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma, how come you know so much about disco? I know everything.
OTHERMALE:I'm old.
LEADMALE:( thunder rumbles ) ( singing ) There.
LEADMALE:That should kill it.
LEADMALE:( singing in Orkan ) Don't look at me like that.
SUPMALE:I'll still respect you.
OTHERFEMALE:( like Peter Lorre ): Please, I-I want to be your friend.
LEADMALE:I won't hurt you if you just don't scream.
LEADMALE:Do you have any last words? ( speaks gibberish ) Okay.
LEADMALE:( shouts ) ( beeps ) Lunch is hell.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you understand by your doing this, a can of soup will live? ( whistling ) Necrotrons! Warning! Mayday! Mayday! Red alert! Dive! In the bunker! In the bunker! Head 'em up.
SUPFEMALE:We're going to Missouri.
LEADFEMALE:Whoo! ( beeps ) Bullets! Total World War! Warning.
LEADMALE:Jive teapot.
LEADMALE:You'll never sing again.
LEADFEMALE:( thunder cracks and rumbles ) I'd like to speak to you about your "ion ratio.
LEADFEMALE:" You fell for it.
LEADFEMALE:( honking bark ) You mean you knew it was going to rain outside? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:I heard it on the radio.
SUPMALE:Then why did you tell me to go out without my raincoat and umbrella? I was splinking.
LEADFEMALE:Why am I afraid to ask? You see, on Ork, splinking is telling someone something that isn't true a practical joke.
SUPFEMALE:( buzzes ) Well, Mork, you might call it splinking, but we humans call it lying, and it isn't acceptable behavior.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you have got to start acting more human.
SUPFEMALE:But I was.
LEADMALE:I saw a Laurel and Hardy movie where Laurel splinked Hardy, then Hardy went, "There's another fine mess.
OTHERMALE:Hmm.
OTHERFEMALE:" Then he threw a bucket of water on Hardy.
LEADFEMALE:( high-pitched squealing ) Laurel and Hardy aren't human.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, they were human, but ( groans ) Just promise me that you won't do any more splinking or lying.
LEADFEMALE:I promise.
LEADMALE:I didn't think you'd mind getting wet.
OTHERMALE:Look at me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm dripping! My clothes are soggy, and my skin is all wet.
LEADMALE:I hate getting wet.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to go take a shower.
LEADMALE:But wait, I made a sandwich for you.
LEADFEMALE:It's untouched by human hands.
LEADMALE:Now, if you want to get Fleetwood Mac, I think this album's your best bet, 'cause it's got just about everything you want to hear All right, all right, where's your father? In one minute, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Wanker.
LEADFEMALE:I happen to be helping a customer.
LEADMALE:$5.
SUPFEMALE:98? If you really want to help your customer, tell him he can get the same album for only $4.
LEADFEMALE:50 at the music store right down the street.
SUPFEMALE:No, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:That's a mistake.
LEADMALE:There is no music store down the street.
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Wanker, you are an absolute Absolutely wonderful to see you here, Arnold.
SUPMALE:Isn't it, dear? Well, it isn't wonderful to see you.
OTHERMALE:I've tried everything short of tear gas to get rid of you.
LEADFEMALE:( horn honking ) In a minute! That's my wife.
LEADMALE:I asked her to drive me to a foreclosure this afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, I guess you need some sort of social life.
LEADFEMALE:And speaking of foreclose, your rent payment is due Friday.
SUPFEMALE:Today is Wednesday.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'll have the money.
LEADFEMALE:In spite of the fact that you've nearly ruined our business by tearing up our sidewalk and turning off the heat.
LEADMALE:It's like an icebox in here.
LEADMALE:I thought you wanted a rent freeze.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I love my work.
LEADMALE:( horn honking ) Oh, shut up! I'm coming! I've got to use the phone.
LEADFEMALE:Where is it? Oh, I know where I'd like it to be.
LEADMALE:FRED: Yeah, around his neck.
LEADMALE:Oh, um, it's over there.
LEADFEMALE:He's already turned off the heat.
LEADMALE:You want him to turn off the lights next? I don't care.
SUPFEMALE:This guy's been getting away with this for years.
SUPMALE:Somebody's got to tell him.
SUPFEMALE:But do we have to do it now? Chambers! I am sick and tired of calling you about this! I want him evicted tomorrow! Well, so what if he's 90 years old.
LEADFEMALE:Tell him to start for the door today.
LEADFEMALE:( horn honking ) Hold on, you old bat! Oh, that's the trouble with people today! They're just too impatient! Now, that is enough.
LEADMALE:Now, wait I don't care somebody's got to tell him off.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Wanker, you have been evicting people and screaming at people and being nasty.
SUPMALE:Do you hear me, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Wanker? Whoa! I think he's dead.
SUPMALE:MRS.
OTHERMALE:WANKER ( crying ): Oh, Arnold! ( loud crying ) Oh, Arnold.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, try to take it easy, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Wanker.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I knew it was coming.
LEADMALE:The doctor told him to take it easy, but no.
LEADMALE:He wouldn't listen.
LEADFEMALE:Arnold CORA: Oh, now Calm down, Annie.
SUPFEMALE:When he left the car When he left the car, little did I know that his last words to me would be "Wait here.
OTHERMALE:" ( wailing ) ( sobbing ) Oh, Cora.
LEADMALE:I feel terrible about this! Yeah, I know, but there's nothing we can do about it now.
SUPMALE:I know, but those awful things we were saying to him.
LEADMALE:He brought this on himself.
LEADMALE:Then why do I feel so guilty? For the same reason I do because he died right here in our store.
SUPFEMALE:We did everything we could, but I'm afraid he's gone.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, thank you.
LEADMALE:I guess you can go now.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call the mortuary.
SUPFEMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:We'll leave the deceased back there, then.
SUPMALE:Uh Right.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Eddie.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Nice suits I'd like to see the rest of the band.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's gonna be a bummer, though, trying to find shoes to match that bag.
LEADFEMALE:Watch out for the hole! My experiment with the pigeons worked.
LEADMALE:They agreed to everything I said.
LEADMALE:Cheer up.
SUPMALE:You look like somebody died.
SUPFEMALE:( honking bark ) ( crying loudly ) Who's the grouch? ( crying ) Mork, will you just be quiet and act like a human being? ( sobbing ) ( imitating cry ) How's that? Shh! She just lost her husband.
LEADFEMALE:It'll be all right.
LEADMALE:He'll turn up.
SUPMALE:( wailing ) He just died.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:He died? Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:The embarrassment.
LEADFEMALE:Genuine look of grief.
LEADFEMALE:He was such a wonderful man.
LEADMALE:Don't you think so? Oh, well, I didn't know him all that well.
LEADFEMALE:We really never Oh, I-I knew him very well.
LEADMALE:I didn't know him at all.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, when we were in Little League, he used to come around with free lemonade for all the kids.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:He puts locks on all the bathrooms.
LEADMALE:( laughs, cries ) Grandma was telling me what a bright, observant little boy he was.
LEADMALE:She said that she just wanted to give him everything.
LEADFEMALE:Half of everything.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thank you.
SUPMALE:You've made me feel so much better.
SUPFEMALE:Why is it the young always die good? Arnold Wanker was one in a million.
LEADFEMALE:He was a beautiful man.
LEADFEMALE:He was a real wurble.
LEADMALE:He was an inspiration.
LEADFEMALE:He was an angel.
SUPMALE:He is now.
OTHERMALE:( crying ) Oh, yes, he's an angel Oh, no, no.
LEADMALE:What Grandma meant was a man that good and that loved and that admired must certainly have found a heavenly place for himself.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Mindy.
LEADMALE:You really cared about him, didn't you? Oh, well, I think I'm safe in saying that Dad, Grandma and I all felt the same way about him.
LEADMALE:He was beautiful.
LEADMALE:Who would believe it? Who would believe it? A few minutes ago, he was here, yelling at us, and now, he's back there, quiet as a mouse.
LEADMALE:He's back there? He's only been there for a few minutes? Yeah, that's right.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Annie ( sobbing ) Annie Annie, dear, why don't I drive you home? Now, come along, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Now, everything is going to be all right.
LEADMALE:( Annie wails and mutters ) I'll stay with her for a few hours.
LEADMALE:It's the least I can do.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Poor woman.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Her only mistake was in marrying an idiot.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Anybody can make that mistake.
LEADFEMALE:My own daughter did.
LEADFEMALE:( sighs ) Dad, do you think that we might have overdone it a little bit? Oh, I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:We were just telling her what she wanted to hear.
LEADMALE:( sighs ) I wonder where Mork went.
OTHERFEMALE:He probably saw a flying saucer and thought it was a class reunion.
LEADFEMALE:( singing in Orkan ) ( laughing ) You lucky Earthlings! Do you think you could tone down the exuberance a little bit? There's no need to be sad anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, a man is dead.
SUPFEMALE:A lot you know.
SUPFEMALE:FRED: What?! ( tooting a fanfare ) ( Fred screams ) Stayin' alive, stayin' alive Stayin' alive But he's supposed to be dead.
SUPFEMALE:Not anymore.
OTHERMALE:I gave him a jump start.
SUPFEMALE:A jump start? You can do that? Well, it's a billion in one shot.
OTHERMALE:I did it once on Ork with a, uh, a hairless crawling zabedee.
LEADMALE:Who would know it would work with a lower form of life.
LEADMALE:Conditions were perfect, though.
LEADMALE:You see, he's still a little groggy.
SUPMALE:( high-pitched cooing ) I know this will work 'cause I saw it during the movies watch.
SUPFEMALE:( deep voice ): Wake up, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:And furthermore, McConnell, I'm going to get you to break that lease if I have to break your legs to do it! Now, now, now, uh, let me get this straight.
SUPFEMALE:Conditions have to be perfect? It's a one in a million shot? One in a billion.
LEADFEMALE:You don't think you can ever do it again? Eh And you wasted it on that miserable rat! But he's your friend.
LEADFEMALE:Friend, my word.
LEADFEMALE:I can't stand him.
SUPFEMALE:But you said all those nice things about him.
LEADMALE:I lied! Oh.
LEADMALE:You? Then you lied, too? Oh, I didn't exactly lie.
LEADFEMALE:I just didn't exactly tell the truth.
LEADMALE:What's the difference? Well, the difference is lying is lying, and not telling the truth is lying.
LEADMALE:You're right; I lied.
LEADFEMALE:But you told me lying was bad.
LEADFEMALE:You made me promise never to lie or even splink.
LEADMALE:That stupid woman! I I don't know why I married her! Now I told her to wait.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I got to call a cab! Uh, Arnold, uh, there was a very good reason why she left.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'd like to know what it is.
SUPMALE:Well, you were, um uh, uh Let me see if I can put it delicately.
LEADFEMALE:Just say it quickly.
SUPMALE:Well, you were, uh You bit the big one.
LEADFEMALE:Boot Hill, Great White Hunting Ground.
SUPFEMALE:You bought the farm, you kicked the bucket.
LEADMALE:What is this dodo trying to say? He's trying to say you were dead.
LEADFEMALE:Arnold, you had a heart attack right here in the store.
SUPMALE:Heart attack? Ha! How come I don't remember it? Well, think back.
SUPFEMALE:What do you remember? Well, I was on the phone evicting some I remember my, uh, wife honking the car horn.
LEADMALE:I, uh, remember overcharging my fraternity for the beer, and then I pulled the lemonade trick on the Little League, and then I caught my baby-sitter doing Ho, ho, ho, ho.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:My whole life flashed in front of my eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:That was just before you ( imitates bugle blowing "Taps" ) You're all crazy.
OTHERMALE:This is some kind of trick to keep me from breaking the lease, isn't it? Well, it just won't work.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me, sir.
OTHERMALE:Can you tell me where the loved one is? What loved one? We are supposed to pick up one Arnold Winker, deceased.
SUPMALE:That's Arnold Wanker, deceased.
LEADMALE:Only I'm not deceased, I'm alive.
LEADMALE:And I'm going to stay that way for a long, long time.
SUPMALE:No pickup.
SUPFEMALE:Watch out! ( Wanker yells ) ( thud ) for the hole.
LEADFEMALE:You know, actually, Arnold Wanker really lucked out.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, in that terrible fall, all he broke was both legs and his collarbone.
LEADMALE:But the good news is he'll be in traction for months.
LEADMALE:And knowing him, he'll probably sue himself.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry about yesterday, but after you said all those nice things about him, I thought you'd be happy when I brought him back.
LEADMALE:Oh, it isn't your fault, Mork.
OTHERMALE:I guess I confused you with my speech on lying and splinking.
SUPMALE:Yes, it was very confusing to hear you lie after all that.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I should have explained to you about something called "little white lies.
LEADFEMALE:" All splinks are blue.
LEADFEMALE:A little white lie is what you tell when you don't want to hurt somebody's feelings.
LEADFEMALE:But how could you hurt Wanker's feeling? He was Croak City.
SUPMALE:But I really would have hurt his wife's feelings if I had told the truth.
LEADFEMALE:So, I just sort of bent it a little.
OTHERMALE:A little? All right, I stretched it a lot.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, so I see on Earth, the truth gets a lot of exercise.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but as a rule, you should always tell the truth.
SUPFEMALE:I should never lie? Never.
LEADFEMALE:( door opening ) Hi.
LEADMALE:MINDY: Oh! Oh, I'm so glad you kids are home.
LEADMALE:Now, I've been invited to the Gray Panthers Prom for next Sunday, and I want you to see my new dress.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! Oh! Author.
LEADMALE:( laughs ) Grandma, it's really colorful.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what I really wanted was a man's opinion.
LEADMALE:( laughing ) Mork, splink like you have never splunk.
LEADFEMALE:Mork? Que wapa! ( giggling ) ( speaking nonsense Spanish ) Cordoba Corinthian.
LEADFEMALE:( giggling ): Oh! ( speaks nonsense Spanish ) Oh, do you really like it? Huevos rancheros, amigo.
SUPMALE:( laughs ) Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:ORSON: I hear you, Mork.
LEADMALE:( electronic whirring ) Good evening, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:and Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Universe and all ships in space.
LEADMALE:Let's go to press.
LEADMALE:Dit dit-dit-dit de-de de-de-de.
LEADFEMALE:Flash! File the report, Mork.
SUPMALE:Aw, but you take all the fun out of it.
LEADMALE:The report! ( electronic whirring ) Yes, your Immenseness.
SUPMALE:Today's report is about little white lies.
LEADFEMALE:What? They're the same as little blue splinks.
SUPMALE:See, there are several kinds of white lies.
OTHERFEMALE:Number one, the sports lie.
SUPMALE:I'm tellin' you, Harry, you should have seen the one that got away.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm talkin' big big.
SUPMALE:You know, so big, it almost swamped the dingy.
SUPMALE:Then, there are vanity lies.
SUPFEMALE:How old are you, Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Vandergroff? ( old woman's voice ): I'm only 28 years old.
LEADMALE:Then, there are the kind of lies to keep you from getting your lips ripped off.
OTHERMALE:( Southern accent ): Barbara Jean, that was the best meal I've ever had.
SUPMALE:Who could believe it was the first one you've ever cooked? I've never seen anybody do that with figs before.
LEADFEMALE:The secret must be in the cheese.
SUPFEMALE:( imitates newsman ): That's the way it is here on Earth.
SUPMALE:Until next week ( regular voice ): this is Mork signing off.
SUPFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
SUPMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! Mork, where are you? Are you? Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:( mumbling in Orkan ) Good morning.
LEADMALE:Oh, good morning.
SUPFEMALE:Are you just getting up now? Oh, I've been up for several hours.
SUPFEMALE:I had to make my report to Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Huh all that time, huh? Well, he put me on hold.
LEADMALE:( chuckling ): Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Then you don't know.
OTHERMALE:Look, it's snowing outside.
SUPFEMALE:Shazbot! The sky is falling, the sky is falling! Mayday! Mayday! Take evasive action.
LEADFEMALE:You get under there with the baby.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have a baby too bad.
SUPFEMALE:They were going to scoff at Chicken Little, but they're not laughing now.
SUPFEMALE:That little sucker's gonna make a lot of money off this.
OTHERMALE:I've got to call him, I've got to call Just my luck he's unlisted.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, calm down.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just snow.
SUPMALE:It's perfectly harmless.
SUPFEMALE:It is? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, do I feel like a flake.
LEADMALE:( laughing ) Hey, where'd you learn that story about "the sky is falling"? Well, I was baby-sitting for Eugene, and, uh, he told me that story just before I fell asleep.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, if you'd heard that story all the way through, you would have understood the point.
SUPFEMALE:See, Chicken Little thought an acorn dropped on his head, and because of that he thought the sky was falling, and that means that he was gullible.
LEADMALE:That was the point.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, therefore, if I think the sky is falling, ipso facto, I am gullible.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I'm afraid so.
LEADMALE:Like yesterday, when you heard that TV commercial that said to run out and catch a bus, and you started building a trap.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I would've caught one, too.
LEADMALE:I was going to use a segregated school as bait.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I have a surprise for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, surprise, surprise! Don't tell me, oh, don't tell me.
LEADFEMALE:Let me guess.
LEADMALE:Cuff links! Come on.
LEADMALE:Come on, you know what's in there.
OTHERMALE:You gave me the money to buy it for you yourself.
LEADMALE:Hey, don't rain on my parade.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see, let's see, let's Boy, a coat! Just what I've always wanted.
SUPFEMALE:Oh Come on, you should put it on and get dressed and go out and observe the snow.
LEADFEMALE:It'll be a whole new experience.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure those sky flakes won't bash my brains out? I promise you it's perfectly safe.
LEADFEMALE:Come here, I want to show you something.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:( chuckling ): Don't be afraid.
LEADFEMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
OTHERFEMALE:It's cold and beautiful.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:And not housebroken.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, Dad, he's become very responsible lately.
SUPFEMALE:Y-Yeah, he was responsible for that.
LEADFEMALE:He-He was responsible for that, too, yeah.
LEADMALE:Now, that wasn't his fault, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Well, it was an old cat, anyway.
SUPMALE:( pounding knock at door ) Oh, I got to go; somebody's at the door.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay, yeah, I will.
LEADFEMALE:All right, bye-bye.
SUPMALE:( pounding knock ) ( gasping ): Mork! Oh, what happened? Where have you been? Dashing through the snow.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Oh, ah, oh Oh, come on in; you're frozen.
SUPMALE:Sit down and warm up.
SUPMALE:Shazbot, I'm frigid! ( crunching ) Ow! Ah, uh, oh, I'm melting! Mork, what happened to your new coat? I gave it away.
SUPMALE:What?! You gave away your brand-new coat? Well, the man I gave it to didn't have any, and I have two.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, I had to pay him back.
LEADMALE:He gave me a sip out of his paper bag.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, you shouldn't give away your belongings like that.
SUPFEMALE:Monty Hall does.
LEADMALE:Oh I saw him give $1,000 to two sweaty avocados.
SUPFEMALE:( laughing softly ) That's a game show.
LEADMALE:Don't you see, that man took advantage of your generosity.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you've got to learn how to say no.
LEADFEMALE:Do you understand? No! Just practicing.
SUPFEMALE:( doorbell rings ) I'll get it.
LEADMALE:No! Nein! Mm-mmm! No way, baby, not me, mm-mmm.
LEADMALE:Hiya, mister.
OTHERFEMALE:Would you like to buy some cookies? No! How was that? That was deplorable.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Mork, how could you slam the door in that poor little girl's face? Well, she was selling cookies, and I didn't want any.
OTHERMALE:Mork, nobody wants those cookies.
OTHERMALE:But you don't, you don't slam the door in a little girl's face.
LEADFEMALE:Oh ( knock at door ) Okay, buster, so much for the soft sell.
SUPMALE:Look, chump, this is for charity, you know.
SUPFEMALE:If you don't buy, some sweet little kid doesn't go to camp namely me.
SUPFEMALE:And we don't make diddley on these crackers unless we sell volume.
OTHERFEMALE:And we need big bucks.
SUPMALE:Am I getting through to you, Bright Eyes? I'll take a box.
LEADMALE:Not good enough.
OTHERFEMALE:Two boxes.
SUPFEMALE:That wouldn't buy my sweat socks.
SUPMALE:Mork, don't get carried away.
LEADFEMALE:I can't; all I've got is three bucks.
LEADFEMALE:You'll owe me the rest.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you let that little girl trick you out of your money.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-uh, not me.
LEADFEMALE:I played a trick on her.
OTHERFEMALE:I've got a dollar left.
LEADMALE:Shazbot, it's in my new coat.
LEADFEMALE:But seriously, you know, I met a girl.
LEADFEMALE:Now I'm not going to say she's incredible, but, you know, yada-yada.
LEADMALE:And that was just her head.
OTHERMALE:( laughing ): What are you doing? My drum shtick.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you can stay here and play the drum if you want.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna beat it.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Humor.
LEADMALE:( imitating Mork's honking bark ) ( squeaking ) I got to go to the bank, so I'll be back in five minutes, okay? Take as long as you want.
LEADFEMALE:You're in good hands with Orkstate.
SUPMALE:Now, that's humor.
SUPFEMALE:( honking bark ) ( squeaking ) I'll see you later.
LEADMALE:Oh, excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, help him out.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me, what're ya what the heck you doing? I'm helping you out.
SUPMALE:That's the last time I ever come in here to get warm.
SUPFEMALE:( singing in Orkan ) ( police whistle blowing ) Hold it! I tell you, you got the wrong guy.
OTHERFEMALE:That's a gross prevarication.
OTHERMALE:Put your hand through here.
SUPMALE:I've apprehended you, and I shall apprehend your partner forthwith.
LEADMALE:I'm off to pursue his accomplice.
OTHERFEMALE:Keep an eye on this one.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? Keeping my eye on you.
OTHERMALE:Hey, back off.
SUPMALE:I'm in no mood for jokes.
SUPFEMALE:I've had a real crummy day.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry to hear about that.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? Well, it started off pretty good.
LEADMALE:I escaped from prison.
LEADMALE:Everything's been downhill since then.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, prison I know about that.
OTHERFEMALE:That's where you get free clothes, free food, no rent.
SUPMALE:Sounds better the way you put it.
OTHERMALE:I really didn't like being in there.
SUPMALE:Why did you go? Well, it's a long story.
LEADFEMALE:As a kid, I was a shoplifter.
SUPFEMALE:( whistles ) Boy, you must be strong.
LEADFEMALE:No, it was mostly small stuff.
LEADMALE:And then I started stealing cars, and they finally caught me, and here I am.
LEADMALE:Boy, I feel really bad.
SUPFEMALE:I never stole a car, and here I am, too.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I, uh, I wanted to get out one last time to see my poor sick mother.
LEADMALE:You have a mother? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Now I guess I'll never see her again.
LEADMALE:Choke.
LEADFEMALE:Gasp.
LEADMALE:Look of sincere empathy.
SUPFEMALE:Is there anything I can do for you? Well, you could get me out of these handcuffs and let me go.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'd be glad to.
LEADFEMALE:Every son should see his mother.
SUPMALE:Wish I had one, but Hey, wait, doesn't that policeman want you to stay here? Oh, I'll be back.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about that.
LEADMALE:You promise? Cross my heart and hope to die.
LEADFEMALE:You're sure the policeman won't mind? He won't give it a second thought.
LEADFEMALE:Trust me.
SUPMALE:And I'll be back by, say, uh Kay-o.
SUPMALE:( high-pitched beep ) How did you do that? It's kind of like a card trick, but I do it with molecules.
OTHERMALE:That's incredible.
LEADFEMALE:Never mind, uh, uh, thanks, buddy.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, see you around.
OTHERMALE:Say hi to Mom for me.
LEADMALE:That reminds me.
LEADMALE:I'm a little short on cash.
LEADFEMALE:Could you loan me ten bucks? Ten dollars what do you think, I'm gullible? ( chuckling ): Here, here's five.
LEADMALE:Get out of here! Mork, Mork, did you hear what's going on? A cop is chasing a couple of escaped criminals.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:He brought one in here and tried to tie him up with this metal thing.
SUPFEMALE:Where is he? I let him go.
LEADFEMALE:You what? I hate to blow my own horn.
LEADMALE:Blow your own horn?! Well, if you insist.
LEADFEMALE:( imitating trumpet with mute ) ( imitating Louis Armstrong ): Thank you, baby, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with him? Oh, the doctor put some drops in my eyes, and I can't see a thing, but I'll be back to normal in a couple of hours.
SUPFEMALE:In the meantime, do you want to have some fun? Let's let go of him and watch him bump into the wall.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, you're never going to guess what Mork just did.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, do we have to notify next of kin? A policeman caught an escaped criminal, and Mork just set him free.
LEADFEMALE:What? ( shouting ): A policeman caught an escaped criminal, and Mork just set him free! Well, why in the world would you release an escaped criminal? Excuse uh ( shouting ): Because he wanted me to! Stop shouting, stop shouting.
OTHERFEMALE:For goodness sakes.
LEADMALE:Mork, this is serious.
LEADMALE:I don't know why everybody's so upset.
LEADMALE:He said he'd turn himself in tomorrow.
LEADMALE:He lied to you, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I don't think so.
LEADMALE:He never lied to me before.
OTHERFEMALE:Besides, he said he wanted to get out of prison to see his sick mother.
LEADMALE:And you bought that? I don't think he'd sell his mother.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, how could you believe that? I sense that you're mad at me.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, you're getting warmer.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, I'm not mad at you.
LEADFEMALE:It's, it's just that you're too trusting.
OTHERMALE:And that's bad? It is.
SUPMALE:Trust me.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you see, you let an escaped prisoner get away.
LEADFEMALE:Why, uh, that's a crime.
OTHERMALE:His cohort got away, but I presume one jailbird in the hand is worth Where is he? Now, where's who? The prisoner I had handcuffed right here.
OTHERMALE:Oh, why, uh, he got away.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mork had nothing to do with it.
LEADMALE:And I'm an eyewitness to that.
SUPMALE:I can understand what you're trying to do.
LEADMALE:You're trying to protect me, but I can't let you take the coat for me.
SUPMALE:The rap.
LEADFEMALE:Your planet.
SUPFEMALE:I let your prisoner go.
LEADFEMALE:Young man, what you did wasn't nice.
LEADFEMALE:You released my suspect.
LEADMALE:Boy, am I perturbed.
OTHERMALE:I should strike you about the head and shoulders.
LEADFEMALE:What're you going to do? I'm taking him in for aiding and abetting an escaped prisoner.
LEADMALE:Oh You need these.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you've been there before, huh? Don't worry, Mindy.
LEADMALE:It'll be all right.
LEADMALE:He'll come back.
LEADFEMALE:I know he will.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:He was real happy when he left.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, the judge'll be ready for your preliminary hearing in about a half an hour.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Officer Bob.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Come on, fellas.
SUPFEMALE:The judge is ready to give you guys your sentences now.
OTHERMALE:I have a sentence for you.
SUPMALE:Uh, vamonos, meshuggeners.
LEADFEMALE:I hate to tell you guys this, uh, but you got the hanging judge, and he's in a bad mood.
LEADMALE:Have a nice day.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:( imitating harmonica, playing mournful tune ) Don't push! We're going, we're going.
OTHERFEMALE:Come along, my brothers.
LEADFEMALE:He's a non-believer.
SUPFEMALE:All we can do is forgive him.
LEADMALE:You're going to crowd all of us in this one tiny cell? Ciao.
LEADMALE:Exidor, is that you? Mork? Is that you? Where are you? I'm over here! Step aside! I can't see! Ah! There you are.
LEADMALE:Mork, my old friend.
LEADMALE:Exidor, why are you in jail? Religious persecution.
SUPFEMALE:Why are you here? I set a criminal free.
LEADMALE:Why did you do that? That's against the law.
SUPFEMALE:Well, he said he had to get out to see his sick mother, and he promised he'd be back today.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, Mork.
LEADMALE:( laughing ) As my dear father would say, you're a pea brain! But I know he'll come back.
LEADMALE:He promised.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, the man lied to you, just as those crummy Venusians lied to me.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:You can't trust a man with four lips.
LEADFEMALE:All you get is double-talk.
SUPMALE:They promised me they were coming down to destroy the Earth on Labor Day.
LEADFEMALE:They let me down.
LEADFEMALE:Bummer.
LEADMALE:Sorry to hear that.
LEADFEMALE:It was then I realized that my faith had been misplaced, and I began my quest for truth.
SUPFEMALE:I tried Buddhism, Catholicism, Judaism, Punch and Judaism but nothing worked for me until I found Him! Who? Mork I worship O.
LEADMALE:J.
LEADFEMALE:Simpson! Isn't he a football player? A football player? Mork, he is the football player.
OTHERMALE:Tell me, did you ever see the Reverend Ike streak down the sidelines untouched? Did you ever see Billy Graham snake over from the two? Did you ever see Oral Roberts juke a linebacker out of his socks? Sure, Moses walked across the Red Sea, but could he have done it on Astroturf? Mork, I believe in the Juice.
SUPFEMALE:You, too, can be a born-again Simpson.
OTHERMALE:Let O.
LEADFEMALE:J.
LEADMALE:show you the way.
LEADFEMALE:Just look at my followers.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at the peace and serenity in their eyes.
SUPFEMALE:There's Isaiah Hi.
LEADMALE:Merlin Howdy.
LEADMALE:Too Tall Whoa Bubba My man.
SUPMALE:These, Mork, are my conversions.
SUPFEMALE:Conversions good for one point.
OTHERFEMALE:( honking bark ) You know, Mork, before I found O.
SUPFEMALE:J.
LEADMALE:, I couldn't laugh this easily.
SUPMALE:He can do the same for you as he's done for me.
LEADMALE:Join us, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Follow us to the Promised Land.
LEADMALE:San Francisco? Yea, verily, Candlestick Park.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I see believe, and ye shall bear oranges.
SUPFEMALE:Praise Anita! Yes! Mork, I want you to renounce your sins against football.
SUPMALE:Exidor, I watched the World Series.
LEADMALE:Oh, blasphemy! The World Series? Baseball is pagan.
SUPMALE:Do ten Hike Marys.
LEADMALE:And I look up to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
SUPMALE:Ah, do a hundred push-ups.
LEADMALE:And I hate to say this I like Howard Cosell.
OTHERMALE:Let us pray.
SUPMALE:Hut, hut, hut! Amen.
LEADMALE:Do you mind not smoking? This man is having a religious experience.
OTHERMALE:Are you feeling it, Mork? No.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you feel it now? No.
LEADFEMALE:Do you feel it now?! Whoa! Praise football! Give me that old-time football Give me that old-time football It's good enough for me.
LEADFEMALE:Sunday in San Francisco.
SUPMALE:Some good and glorious happenings.
SUPFEMALE:Can you hear it now? Tell me, brother.
LEADMALE:Now O.
LEADFEMALE:J.
LEADFEMALE:takes the ball on the seven now, runs it 30 yards, but, oh, no, clipping now, clipping now, can you feel that clipping now? 15 yards, 15 yards.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADMALE:J.
SUPMALE:takes the ball again, and a hole opens up before him now.
OTHERFEMALE:He's on the 50 now, on the 40 now, on the 30 now, on the 20 now, on the ten now, and he goes in! Salvation! Beg for mercy! Oh, oh, Mork! You're a true believer, Mork! I hate to disappoint you, Exidor, but I don't have much faith in football, and O.
LEADFEMALE:J.
OTHERFEMALE:'s just a man, and football's just a game.
OTHERFEMALE:Blasphemy! Mork you've just fouled out in the game of life! May you burn in Buffalo! Oh, Mork! Oh, Mork Good-bye.
LEADMALE:Oh, we tried to bail you out, but they won't let us until the preliminary hearing.
SUPFEMALE:Bail me out why, am I leaking? How was your night in jail? Nobody knows the trouble I've seen.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what trouble? Nobody knows.
OTHERFEMALE:Has he showed up yet? Mork, that guy he escaped from prison.
LEADFEMALE:Now, why would he want to go back? Because he said he wanted to see his sick mother.
LEADMALE:Oh, his poor sick mother.
LEADMALE:When it comes to trust, he's full of it! He's crazy, you know.
OTHERFEMALE:But don't just take it from us.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, I have to break up a fight.
LEADFEMALE:( blows whistle ) Bubba! Too Tall! Break it up! Huddle on the 15! I'll be all right.
SUPMALE:He promised he'd be back by 2:00.
LEADMALE:MINDY: Well, there's your proof.
SUPFEMALE:It's after 2:30 right now.
SUPMALE:It is? Yeah.
LEADMALE:But he promised.
LEADMALE:I did him a favor.
OTHERMALE:Boy, I really Orked it up this time.
SUPMALE:Oh, I guess you've proven your point.
LEADMALE:I should never trust anyone anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry I'm late Mom got thirsty, so I knocked over a liquor store.
LEADMALE:Just kidding.
OTHERFEMALE:A little slammer humor.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Mom says "Hi" and "Thanks".
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you're welcome.
SUPFEMALE:Do I get out now? No.
LEADFEMALE:You still committed a crime but due to the extenuating circumstances, I'll have a dialogue with the adjudicator, and I think you will be, as the street people put it, extricated.
LEADMALE:I don't understand.
LEADMALE:Why'd you turn yourself in? I promised him.
LEADMALE:Just because I'm a thief doesn't mean I'm a liar.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't let him get in trouble for helpin' me.
LEADFEMALE:He's the only one that's trusted me except Mom, and she hides her jewelry.
SUPFEMALE:( blows whistle ) You're late for practice, Whitey.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Dad, maybe we've become too cynical.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe we get what we expect out of people.
SUPFEMALE:There's an old Orkan phrase about that: "If one cannot trust oneself, then one cannot trust another.
SUPMALE:" Oh, that's nice.
LEADMALE:I'm not finished.
LEADFEMALE:"And if one cannot trust another, "then others cannot trust another, "and then others cannot trust others, and finally, who can one trust?" Uh, does everybody on Ork talk like that? Well, we don't have sex.
LEADMALE:We've got to do something.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:ORSON: Hello, this is Orson.
LEADMALE:You'll have to call back later, because I'm out of my mind right now.
LEADFEMALE:If you like, you may leave a message between the two beeps.
LEADFEMALE:( beeps ) Hi, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:This is Mork.
SUPMALE:I just called to say that ( beeps ) ORSON: Hello, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry I was busy.
SUPFEMALE:What were you doing? Taking a meteor shower? ( honking bark ) Mork, will you be serious? Sorry, O Fattest of All Living Things.
OTHERMALE:This week, I learned about a popular Earth religion.
LEADMALE:Believe it or not, some life-forms here worship O.
SUPMALE:J.
LEADMALE:Simpson.
LEADMALE:The Juice? Yes, and even the Gentiles.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that the only religion on Earth? No, there's several others, but the main difference is that football services are held on Sunday afternoon instead of the morning.
LEADMALE:Don't Earthlings need a common belief to unite them? Oh, they have that.
LEADMALE:They all believe they can't trust one another.
OTHERMALE:Why do they feel that way? I guess they're afraid of being hurt.
LEADFEMALE:Too bad they don't make football pads for the heart.
LEADMALE:This is Mork, signing off from Boulder, Colorado.
LEADMALE:Until next week, nanu-nanu.
SUPMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:Shazbot! MAN: Say, I like your place.
SUPMALE:Mmm thanks You know, I wasn't sure you'd ever want to see me again.
OTHERMALE:Now, Dan, do I look like the type of girl who would hold a little thing like a broken engagement against you? You have the right to remain silent.
LEADMALE:Anything you do say will be held against you Mindy, Mindy, I didn't mean to hurt you.
SUPMALE:I just wasn't ready to settle down.
LEADFEMALE:Then why did you ask me to marry you? Well, I was young.
LEADMALE:I didn't know what I wanted.
OTHERMALE:I have to admit I was surprised that you called.
SUPFEMALE:I thought that you were probably out sowing your wild oats.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now I think I'm more interested in rice.
LEADMALE:Uh, which reminds me, there's a new Japanese restaurant I'd like to try for lunch tomorrow.
LEADMALE:How does that sound to you? I'd love it.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:I'll, uh, pick you up at noon.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Then noon it is.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for goin' out, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thanks for asking me out, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:It was fun.
SUPMALE:It always was.
SUPMALE:Tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:( whistles ) Mindy! Mork! How was your mating? Dating! That's dating.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:And it was wonderful.
LEADMALE:Dan took me to this great Danish restaurant.
LEADMALE:Sounds interesting.
LEADMALE:What do great Danes eat? And he's taking me to lunch tomorrow, too.
OTHERFEMALE:What is it about this earthling that makes you so hungry? Well, Dan and I are old friends.
SUPFEMALE:As a matter of fact, our relationship had gotten pretty serious at one time.
LEADMALE:Serious.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, sounds like you need cheering up.
SUPFEMALE:Come see my apartment.
OTHERFEMALE:I've just redecorated the attic, and it's scamp city and totally taste-free! Come on! ( speaking Orkan ) ( yells like Tarzan ) ( speaking Orkan ) What do you think? Well, what can I say except it's you? You like my bed? You sleep on that? Oh, it's not bad once you get the hang of it.
LEADMALE:( honking bark ) What's this? Oh, it's a hide-a-bed for houseguests.
OTHERMALE:Now, I must say, I've never seen a lamp sticking out of the wall quite like that.
LEADMALE:I like to read in bed.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mork, this place certainly is designed for your kind of living.
LEADFEMALE:What an interesting wall covering! It's grass.
LEADMALE:Mork, why do you have grass on your wall? Oh, the plants kept falling off.
SUPFEMALE:Can I get you something to sit on? Here, here's my footstool.
LEADFEMALE:Now, that's a great idea! A footstool shaped like a foot.
LEADFEMALE:Wait'll you see the end tables I've ordered.
LEADMALE:Well, Mork, I think you've done a fabulous job.
LEADMALE:It looks really good.
LEADMALE:( buzzing sound ) What's this? It looks like some sort of a calculator or something.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, it's not a calculator.
LEADFEMALE:It's an Orkan Age Machine.
OTHERMALE:A what? Actually, it's a small computer designed to alter our brain waves so we can achieve any age we want.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, why would you want to do that? Well, if you're suffering from tension or feeling uptight, you set it for a certain age, set that, and it's like a vacation, kinda like our version of Fantasy Island.
LEADFEMALE:You know, "Boss, the plane has landed.
SUPFEMALE:" You're kidding.
SUPMALE:Ah, "kidding", no.
LEADFEMALE:That would be button 3.
SUPMALE:Give it a go! Okay.
LEADMALE:( as a child ): No, I don't want your cooties.
LEADFEMALE:( computer buzzing ) ( as teen-ager ): Wow! Come on! All the other kids are in hyperspace.
SUPMALE:I just want the keys to the egg.
LEADMALE:It'd be really right on.
LEADMALE:Where's Dave? ( computer buzzing ) ( chants in Orkan ) ( computer buzzing ) Whoa, I didn't know it went that far back.
LEADMALE:Well, thanks for taking me to lunch, Dan.
LEADMALE:How about dinner? Do you realize how many restaurants we've been to in these last three weeks? Uh, I see you're on to me.
OTHERMALE:You've figured out that I'm trying to get at your heart through your stomach.
LEADFEMALE:( laughing ) Maybe that's why I like you so much.
LEADFEMALE:Most guys immediately want to take the scenic route.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:M.
LEADMALE:Uh, pick you up at 8:00? Okay, I'll be ready.
LEADFEMALE:All right, uh good-bye.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:I'd turn sideways, but I haven't got one.
LEADFEMALE:Hi Mindy! How are you? Oh, Sally! Well, I see you're still hangin' in there! Yeah.
LEADMALE:I feel just like the Post Office.
SUPMALE:Neither of us deliver on time.
LEADMALE:Well, hello, Sally, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Can we do anything for you? Yeah, you could tell me if my shoes match.
LEADMALE:Well, have you put in your request for a boy or a girl? Well, Cora, what difference does it make? With a mother like Sally that baby's gonna be beautiful either way.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what a lovely thing to say.
LEADFEMALE:Just for that, if it's a boy, I'm gonna name him after you.
LEADMALE:Fascinating! A boy called Weiner! Oh, Cora Uh, nice to see you, Sally.
SUPFEMALE:You, too.
SUPMALE:Listen, you wouldn't happen to have The Little Engine That Could? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Let me check in the children's section.
LEADMALE:Oh, good.
LEADMALE:You know, Sally, you look absolutely radiant.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on.
SUPFEMALE:You do.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think I've ever seen you look this good.
LEADMALE:It's motherhood.
LEADMALE:You oughta try it sometime.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe I will sometime.
LEADFEMALE:I like kids, but I don't think I'm ready to be a mother yet.
LEADMALE:Oh Mindy Oh, who's your fat friend? Mork! Oh, parallel universe! What a coincidence! My name's Mork, too.
LEADMALE:Na-nu, na-nu! Um, Sally Freeman, this is my friend, Mork.
OTHERMALE:And Sally isn't fat; she's pregnant.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:What's pregnant? Didn't your parents ever tell you anything? I don't have any parents.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a test tube baby.
LEADMALE:( laughing ) That's Mork.
OTHERMALE:Always with the jokes.
LEADMALE:( honking bark ) I just felt a kick! Somebody kicked you? Must have been hit-and-run.
LEADMALE:Mork, her baby kicked her.
SUPFEMALE:Why, what did she do to it? She didn't do anything to it.
LEADFEMALE:A baby always kicks when it's inside its mother.
SUPMALE:There's a baby in there! You're tryin' to jive my socks off! There's a real live ( makes baby sounds ) Whoa, shazbat! Kids get in the darndest places.
SUPFEMALE:SALLY: I can't wait till he's born so I can see what he looks like.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll bet he's round.
OTHERFEMALE:Sally, do you think that you'll go back to work after you have the baby? No, Mindy, I want to do all that hokey stuff.
SUPMALE:You know, I want to build blocks and play peek-a-boo and take him for walks in the park, watch him grow up.
OTHERFEMALE:That's gonna be my career.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's really nice.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, here's your record.
LEADFEMALE:It's on the house.
LEADMALE:It's, uh, a birthday present.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks a lot.
LEADMALE:I'll see you later, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Oh, good luck.
LEADMALE:So long, Mork.
OTHERMALE:Good-bye.
OTHERFEMALE:Good-bye.
SUPMALE:Oh Whew Oh, you know, Mork, I really envy Sally.
OTHERMALE:She really knows what she wants.
LEADMALE:And I envy her baby.
LEADFEMALE:You envy her baby? Why? It has something I never had a mother.
LEADMALE:Oh Good night, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, Dan.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing up so late? Something was bothering me.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't sleep.
SUPMALE:So I decided I'd relax by soaking in a hot tub.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that's what I always do.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, is there anything you want to talk about? Mork, what are you doing? ( Mork talking underwater ) Mork! On Earth you don't soak your head in a tub like that.
SUPFEMALE:You soak your feet! Are you kidding? If I soak my feet in there, I wouldn't last five minutes! Well, do you want to tell me what the problem is? All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Sit down.
LEADMALE:Ever since I met your friend Sally, I I always thought I was raised in the best possible way.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, how were you raised? By a computer.
LEADMALE:Computer! Oh, yes.
SUPMALE:Her name was Nannivac 30.
SUPMALE:But all the 8,000 kids in our warehouse used to just call her "Nanny.
LEADMALE:" Every bleem she'd wash me, feed me, burp me, take care of all my needs.
LEADFEMALE:Did she change you, too? Well, I'm a better person for having known her.
SUPMALE:But somehow after seeing Sally and how happy she was, I feel like I'm missing something.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, you missed being loved.
SUPMALE:But Nanny was always there.
LEADFEMALE:Every morning I'd roll past her on the conveyer belt.
OTHERFEMALE:She'd pick me up in her warm little metal claws, tickle me under the chin with a high-intensity laser and sing in that soft little voice ( hums melody from Close Encounters of the Third Kind ) If that's not love, what is it? Factory servicing.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't an Earth mother do the very same thing? Well, yeah, but she does it because she wants to, not because she's plugged in.
LEADMALE:Oh, I see.
LEADFEMALE:On Earth then, a mother's a very important job, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know a job more important.
LEADMALE:Do you want to have babies someday? Well, you know, I I didn't think I did, but I think I might, yeah.
LEADMALE:How about tomorrow? Mork, it isn't that easy.
LEADFEMALE:I'll help.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, I think there's something that you and I should talk about.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, if it's about having babies, I know all about that.
LEADFEMALE:First the bird lands and adds the pollen.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:You see, Mork, Dan has asked me to be his wife.
LEADFEMALE:Dan! That guy you've been eating around with? Did you say yes? No Whew hey But I think I'm going to.
LEADMALE:Oh I'm very happy for you.
SUPMALE:MORK: Mindy, what's on your brain? I'm about to be married and I I feel like I just might be biting off more than I can chew.
LEADMALE:Ooh, sounds like a marriage on Alpha Centauri.
OTHERMALE:There the bride and the groom eat the best man.
LEADMALE:They eat the best man? Ah, but it's done in good taste, though.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure it is.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, I I'm worried.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't know what it would be like to have a child.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and I'm sad because I don't know what it would be like to have a mother.
SUPFEMALE:Well, at least I've got a way of finding out.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:( orkan humming ) I have a way we both can find out.
SUPFEMALE:I'll set my age machine for three years old ( beeping ) for ten minutes.
SUPMALE:( beeping ) That way I'll be your baby ( beeps ) and you'll be my ( computer bleeps ) ( baby voice ): Mommy! Mommy, hold me! Hold me! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! That was fun.
SUPFEMALE:Let's do it again.
OTHERFEMALE:No, No, Mork, you're too heavy for that.
LEADFEMALE:Me Morky, you Mommy.
SUPFEMALE:No, me Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, this is ridiculous.
LEADMALE:Aha.
LEADMALE:Look here.
SUPMALE:I know where my belly button is.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's that's nice.
SUPMALE:Can I see yours? No! Come on, Mork, now give me your age machine.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's mine! ( blows raspberry ) ( laughs ) Now, Morky, Dan is gonna be here any minute and it'll be embarrassing to have a giant three- year-old running around, so give me your age machine.
SUPFEMALE:No, no! Can't get it! Can't get it! Na, na, weiner, weiner, weiner! Now, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Now you listen, young man, you give me that age machine right now.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ) ( doorbell rings ) That's Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Morky, Mommy has company so why don't you take a nice nap? No.
LEADFEMALE:Morky not sleepy.
LEADMALE:I wanna stay up all night and drive Mommy shazbot.
OTHERMALE:Nyah, nyah, n-nyah! If Morky takes a nap, Mommy'll make him his favorite treat, and he knows what that is.
SUPFEMALE:A baloney sundae! Yay! ( doorbell rings ) Oh, nice toys.
SUPMALE:Nice toys.
OTHERFEMALE:Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
SUPMALE:Shh.
SUPFEMALE:I'll let you play with these if you promise to be quiet.
SUPFEMALE:Promise? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Okay, you be good.
LEADFEMALE:Shh.
LEADMALE:Shh.
LEADMALE:Shh.
LEADMALE:Shh.
OTHERMALE:( cackles ) ( doorbell rings ) Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:What's the rush? The movie doesn't start for an hour.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Sure, come on in.
SUPMALE:Oh Oh, is that for me? Uh, no, that is for our firstborn.
LEADMALE:Dan, that's a little premature.
LEADMALE:I haven't even made my mind up yet.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you will.
LEADFEMALE:( Mork singing baby Orkan-talk ) Did you hear that? ( clunking ) It's probably squirrels.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, when we get married, it is going to be so great.
LEADMALE:I can hardly wait to hear the pitter-patter of little feet.
SUPFEMALE:( loud, clunking pitter-patter ) ( Mork singing baby Orkan-talk ) Say, uh, are you sure we're alone? Well, yes.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, uh there's a plumber in the attic.
LEADMALE:( beads clicking ) ( baby talk ) It, uh looks like your plumber broke his necklace.
LEADMALE:( chuckles nervously ) Yeah, well, I sure am glad he got those out of the pipes.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, I'll just go up and see if he found the earrings, too.
LEADFEMALE:Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Mork ( singsongy ): Morky, where are you? ( shrieks ) ( laughs ) That is not funny.
SUPFEMALE:Now come out of there.
OTHERMALE:You broke my pearls and rolled them all down the stairs.
LEADFEMALE:Not all.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, Mork, you promised to be quiet.
LEADMALE:( loud ): But I am being quiet! Shh! No, you're ( blows raspberry ) No, you're not.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I am! Yes, I am! Yes, I am! Shh! So there.
OTHERMALE:Besides I have nothing quiet to do and I'm not a mime.
LEADMALE:Why don't why don't you just play? Can I play dress-up? DAN: Mindy? Uh, coming, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:I don't care what you play but just play quiet.
LEADFEMALE:Yay! A dog for a day, yay! Mork, just play quiet.
LEADMALE:Okay? Okay? Answer me.
LEADMALE:( loudly ): You said be quiet! Shh! Just play quiet.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, shh.
SUPFEMALE:Shh.
LEADFEMALE:Shh.
OTHERFEMALE:Shh.
LEADMALE:( spits, bead tinkles ) ( laughs loudly ) Kids.
LEADFEMALE:Is everything fixed? Well, uh, no, but everything will be back to normal in about, uh, six minutes.
LEADFEMALE:( clinking ) You know, it sounds like you've got a plumber that's not too experienced.
LEADMALE:Oh, he isn't.
SUPFEMALE:But only the young ones will make house calls.
OTHERMALE:Here, I picked up your pearls.
LEADMALE:You know, when we have kids you can't leave those laying around.
OTHERFEMALE:They'll put them in their mouths.
LEADMALE:I've heard.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I think I want about ten.
OTHERFEMALE:Ten kids?! That's inconceivable.
SUPMALE:No, no, kids are great.
LEADMALE:They are so much fun.
OTHERMALE:Just a joy to have around.
SUPMALE:( crashing ) ( Mork crying ) The, uh, plumber is crying? Oh, uh, he brought his kid with him because he, uh, couldn't find a baby-sitter, so, uh, just wait here.
LEADFEMALE:( Mork crying loudly ) ( crying ) Oh, what happened? Mommy, hurt.
SUPMALE:Boo-boo.
LEADFEMALE:Oh There, there.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Here, here.
OTHERMALE:( cries ) Oh It's gonna be all right.
LEADFEMALE:It'll be all right.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me what happened.
SUPFEMALE:Moo-moo bit me! And then he came down, he attacked my knee.
SUPFEMALE:Bad! ( crying ) Oh, you're right.
OTHERMALE:Bad moo-moo for hurting Morky.
OTHERFEMALE:There, Moo-Moo won't hurt you anymore.
LEADMALE:Mommy, Mommy, you're protecting me against a bad moo-moo.
LEADMALE:Yeah, now come over here and sit down.
LEADFEMALE:I'll find something to dry your tears.
LEADMALE:Morky Mommy can't dry your tears if you're sitting on them.
OTHERFEMALE:There, there.
SUPFEMALE:( blows nose ) There.
LEADFEMALE:Now everything's okay.
SUPFEMALE:Will you always protect me and take care of me? Well, I will until you're old enough to take care of yourself.
SUPMALE:Which will be in about one minute.
LEADMALE:Uh, now, Mommy has to go downstairs if you're all right.
SUPMALE:I'm all right.
OTHERMALE:I'm a big boy.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, now, you be good.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I gotta go potty.
SUPFEMALE:Number three.
LEADFEMALE:The plumber's okay now.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I cheered up his kid.
SUPMALE:Say, you're a real plumber's helper.
LEADMALE:MORK ( as baby ): Oh, humor.
LEADMALE:Aah, aah.
LEADMALE:He has a well-developed sense of humor.
OTHERMALE:Well, he's kinda old for his age.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Mommy! ( baby talk ) Oh, toys.
LEADFEMALE:Mommy! ( car engine starts ) ( crying ) ( cries ): Good-bye, Mommy.
SUPFEMALE:Good-bye, Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:( computer beeping ) ( normal voice ): Good-bye, Mindy.
LEADMALE:( door opens ) Well, good night, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, good-bye, Dan.
LEADMALE:( TV playing ) ( TV music stops ) ( mumbles ) Oh, good-bye.
LEADFEMALE:You must've fallen asleep while watching TV.
SUPFEMALE:If I was asleep, then the TV was watching me.
OTHERFEMALE:How was your movie? We didn't go to the movies.
LEADFEMALE:We just, uh, talked.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, Dan talked, I listened.
LEADFEMALE:I told him I'm not gonna marry him, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Bummer.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess you'll have to rent babies then.
LEADFEMALE:No, that was just the point.
OTHERMALE:All night long Dan just kept talking about babies and then I realized that he never talked about us.
LEADFEMALE:He wasn't into having a wife as much as he wanted a family.
LEADMALE:And I want to be a couple before I'm a group.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry you lost your husband.
SUPMALE:Did my becoming a child affect your decision? Well, I have to admit it opened my eyes.
LEADFEMALE:It's hard to be a mother.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it's pretty tough being a kid, too.
LEADFEMALE:But you made it easy.
LEADMALE:You know something? You're gonna make a terrific mother.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork.
SUPMALE:A toast.
LEADFEMALE:To motherhood? Maybe.
SUPFEMALE:To chickens with lips.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson Come in, Orson.
OTHERMALE:Mork calling Orson Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERMALE:What did you learn about Earth this time, Mork? For one thing, on Earth, babies aren't grown in test tubes.
SUPFEMALE:They're grown in something wonderful called a mother.
OTHERFEMALE:That's the old- fashioned way, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:did it up here, too, as part of a nostalgia craze.
OTHERMALE:Sometimes I think the old way is the best way, Orson.
LEADMALE:Nap, nap.
SUPMALE:Our method is much more efficient.
LEADMALE:Orson, when you were a baby, don't you remember being held and cuddled, taken for walks? Nannivac 26 did that.
LEADFEMALE:But on Earth, a mother does it.
SUPFEMALE:And she does all sorts of other nice things for her children for her entire life.
OTHERFEMALE:Aw, it's a warm and wonderful thing.
SUPFEMALE:How much does she get paid? Nothing.
SUPMALE:Is it because her work is considered of no real value? Oh, no, it's because it's considered priceless.
LEADMALE:Good night, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Orson, one more thing.
SUPMALE:Can you tell me a bedtime story? I don't know any.
LEADMALE:Too bad.
SUPMALE:Good night, Your Immense-ness.
OTHERFEMALE:See you next week.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
SUPMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
OTHERFEMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! So this is where you humans come to ingest food? Well, let's just say that some humans do, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you have restaurants on Ork? Oh no, we just eat whatever's in front of us.
LEADMALE:That's why we have to picnic back-to-back.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, get a load of the talent that just walked in.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's Mindy McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:Her father runs a music store in the mall.
LEADMALE:Who's her handicap? Uh, I think his name's, uh Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? I bet if you yelled in his ear you'd get an echo.
SUPMALE:Well, what do you think I should have? Oh, anything that's on the menu.
LEADMALE:Oh, how about this fly? Whoa! Talk about your fast food.
LEADFEMALE:No, eat what's written there.
LEADMALE:Oh, I think I'll start off with a little sales tax then.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:What would you like? Uh, world peace, an end to poverty, and a date with Annette Funicello.
LEADMALE:Let me know when fun-time is over, okay? Thank you.
SUPMALE:Hey, Marcia, looks like you got a real loser there.
SUPMALE:That's right, George.
SUPFEMALE:You been giving him lessons? Oh Mork, you really need to try to fit in more when we're in public.
SUPMALE:I know, I'm slime.
SUPFEMALE:Oh no Why don't you have the Businessman's Lunch? Why should I have it if he didn't? Hi there, beautiful.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:I was talking to Mindy.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:How do you know my name? I make it my business to get acquainted with every fox in town.
SUPFEMALE:A good way to do that is to leave dead meat on your porch.
SUPFEMALE:This I take it, is Merk? Oh no, that's a great car.
LEADMALE:My name is Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mr.
SUPMALE:Nanu-nanu, if you'll excuse us I'd like to dance with the lady.
LEADMALE:No, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, you'll love it.
OTHERFEMALE:No! Rick, put on some music.
SUPFEMALE:Stop it! What are you doing? Cut it out.
OTHERMALE:Mork, will you do something? Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll order lunch.
SUPMALE:Garson? I can't let you pass up a chance like me, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Stop it.
LEADMALE:Mork, will you help me? If you insist.
LEADFEMALE:Mind if I cut in? Thank you.
SUPMALE:Hey, what are you doing, jerk? No, it's not the jerk, it's the Orkan Hustle.
LEADMALE:See? Mindy said Mindy said that you needed help dancing.
OTHERMALE:We don't need help.
LEADMALE:Oh, games! Tag, you're it! Rick, cut the music.
LEADMALE:( shuts off music ) What did you just do? I think I just went, tag, you're it.
LEADFEMALE:You better take it back.
LEADMALE:Oh, take it back, oh ( speaking backwards ) Mork Relax baby, come here, you'll love it.
LEADMALE:Don't cop out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, cops and robbers, I know how to play that.
LEADMALE:Freeze right there, dirtball! All right, let's go.
SUPFEMALE:Up against the wall.
SUPFEMALE:Quick! 10-4! 10-4! Quick! Up against the wall.
LEADFEMALE:We're going to play a little game right now called Hide and Seek, okay? You're going to close your eyes and count to infinity, right? Infinity, that's ridiculous! Come on! All right, one two, three, four, five, six, seven, Hey, wait! Eight, nine, ten, 11, twelve ( laughing ) Hey, where'd he go? What are you laughing at? That was no gun.
SUPFEMALE:That guy Mork, had his finger in your back.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? In that case, he just became an endangered species.
LEADFEMALE:( grunts ) Mindy, I have some questions I'd like to I still have some questions I'd like to ask about this custom of lunch.
LEADFEMALE:What? When do we eat? That was not a typical example of lunch on the planet Earth.
SUPFEMALE:It wasn't? No.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:For one thing, I don't usually get attacked.
LEADFEMALE:See, I don't like getting attacked.
SUPFEMALE:Why didn't you stop him? I keep forgetting, you just don't understand, do you? Look, Mork, that guy was a stupid creep.
SUPMALE:Somebody should have made him stop.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, you don't understand, you see, Orkans abolished violence a long time ago.
LEADFEMALE:We consider it humiliating.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, haven't you ever known someone that you needed to protect? Well, yes, there was my girlfriend, Zwendira-Mae-Jo-Bob.
LEADMALE:Girlfriend? I thought Orkans had no emotions.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes, but we're still assigned someone to go swimming with so we don't drown.
SUPMALE:How romantic.
LEADMALE:Well, whatever happened to, uh Zwendira-Mae-Jo-Bob.
OTHERFEMALE:She was swallowed by a black hole.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry she was killed.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, she wasn't killed, she just reappeared four years later eight hundred times thinner.
LEADMALE:Look, Mork, I'm not into violence either, but if you're threatened you've got to be able to defend yourself.
LEADFEMALE:The trouble is, you don't understand, do you? Oh, I know all about violence.
LEADFEMALE:I watch TV.
SUPMALE:Here, stand up.
LEADFEMALE:Now, throw a punch at me.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ) Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! ( groans in pain ) See? That's not violence, I didn't even hit you.
SUPFEMALE:Look, violence involves pain.
SUPMALE:None of that stuff on TV is real.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, then the Dallas Cowboys are faking it? No, sports are real.
LEADFEMALE:Whew, what a relief.
LEADMALE:I thought you were going to tell me next that wrestling was fake.
SUPFEMALE:This isn't going to work.
LEADMALE:Let's see How can I teach you about fighting? I know we can always get married.
SUPFEMALE:( laughs ) ( Mork humming "Gonna Fly Now" ) ( speaking in slow motion ) What are you doing? ( speaking in slow motion ): Getting in shape-ape-ape-ape.
LEADMALE:( blows raspberry ) ( panting ) But you were running so slowly.
SUPFEMALE:I was jogging in another time dimension.
LEADMALE:It's a lot healthier, but a lot more exhausting, especially since I haven't been through a time warp in five or six bleems.
OTHERFEMALE:( laughs ) ( door bell rings ) Oh, there's the bell.
SUPMALE:Oh, Howard, you're so ugly, if you take off that toupee, you'd look like a rock.
SUPFEMALE:I think your technique may need a little refinement.
LEADFEMALE:I think you've really got your work cut out for you today.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if the Army could teach me how to box, I can teach Mork.
SUPMALE:Well, Mork doesn't have the faintest idea how to defend himself, so I hope you can help.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I hope so, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, Mindy told me what happened down at The Eatery, and as long as you're going to go out with my daughter you might as well learn how to protect her.
LEADFEMALE:Here, put those on.
LEADFEMALE:I can't, these gloves are pregnant.
SUPFEMALE:No, Mork, they're supposed to be that big.
LEADMALE:Here let me help.
LEADFEMALE:There.
LEADFEMALE:Now, cut that out.
LEADMALE:Don't Orkans have any method of defending themselves? Oh, yes, but they're all non-violent.
SUPMALE:Let's see, there's running away.
SUPMALE:Running away? And whimpering.
LEADFEMALE:And for dangerous situations, we use compliments.
LEADFEMALE:Compliments? What do you mean? Come at me.
LEADFEMALE:Okay You have very lovely hair.
LEADMALE:I mean, what's left of it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm afraid those methods won't work on Earth, so I'm going to have to show you what you're up against.
OTHERMALE:Okay, I always say, if you can't learn something from an alien culture, you might as well stay in your egg, because ow! Now you know what pain is.
SUPMALE:I knew what pain was but nobody ever told me it hurt.
OTHERMALE:But that's why you have to be ready to defend yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, but you see, on Ork we don't hit each other.
LEADFEMALE:We have mental competitions called holitackers.
LEADMALE:I can cream you in a holitacker.
LEADFEMALE:Okay what do I have to do? First of all, no farging before the smegba's.
SUPMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:Two feet inside the force field, and You're going to lose points for that.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, but you have to be ready at all times.
SUPMALE:Now come on, you try to hit me.
SUPMALE:Hit you? Yeah, yeah, try to hit me.
SUPFEMALE:I appreciate what you're trying to do, Pops, but I can't do anything that would cause other people pain.
LEADMALE:But, Mork, if you don't learn to fight, then you're the one that's going to feel pain.
LEADMALE:I'm-I'm sorry, it's against my beliefs.
LEADMALE:( phone rings ) Oh I'll get that.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, what are you going to do if you're attacked? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:But I won't use violence.
LEADMALE:Hello? Yes, he's here.
LEADMALE:Yeah, just a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I think it's that guy from The Eatery; George.
OTHERFEMALE:( goofy ): George.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:( chuckles ) Well, if you insist.
OTHERFEMALE:Kay-o.
LEADFEMALE:Be there or be square.
SUPMALE:Bye-bye.
OTHERMALE:What happened? What did he say? Well, he said he was on his way over to pull my lungs out through my nose.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Dad, tell Mork not to come home.
SUPMALE:Well, he's been hiding out all day because he's afraid he's going to get beaten up.
LEADFEMALE:Well, yeah, that George character is out in front of the house right now.
LEADMALE:Okay, but just tell him what I said.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPFEMALE:( gasps ): Mork! How did you get past George out there? I snuck in the back way.
SUPMALE:This house doesn't have a back way.
SUPFEMALE:It does now.
OTHERMALE:Mork, why are you doing all this? Well, to save my pride.
SUPMALE:You see, on Ork, one who throws a punch is much more foolish than one who receives it.
SUPMALE:And if I got in a fight with George, I'd be humiliating myself.
SUPMALE:On Earth, running around and hiding is considered humiliating.
LEADFEMALE:That's crazy.
LEADFEMALE:In Orkan philosophy, violence is considered a disgrace.
SUPMALE:The highest form of courage is to avoid a fight cleverly.
SUPMALE:I remember the Three Hundred Bleem War.
LEADMALE:We hid from Andromeda.
LEADMALE:Your planet hid from another planet? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:We went behind a comet, and they went right by.
LEADMALE:Well, then what happened? That was it.
SUPFEMALE:That was one of our greatest victories.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, did we laugh when they packed up and went away.
SUPMALE:( honking bark ) That's ridiculous.
OTHERMALE:Ridiculous? Say that to Squellman the Yellow.
LEADMALE:He was one of our greatest heroes.
LEADMALE:He was surrounded by millions of Necrotrons, and he got away by saying the famous line, "Hey, behind you!" That's crazy.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're right.
OTHERMALE:Necrotrons don't even have behinds.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, but enough of this gay banter.
SUPMALE:I'm off to get the mail.
LEADFEMALE:What if George sees you? Oh, he won't see me.
LEADMALE:He'll see Mork Astaire! Ginger? Ginger, is that you? Well, I thought it was a very effective disguise.
LEADMALE:I never realized it was you.
LEADMALE:Morkalong Cassidy.
LEADFEMALE:I think you should either stand up to George or leave town.
SUPMALE:Ching ching ching ching ching.
OTHERMALE:I ain't gonna leave town.
SUPMALE:A man's got to do what a man's got to do when a man's got to do it.
SUPFEMALE:So, what do you got to do? I got to hide.
SUPMALE:How the west was won.
LEADMALE:Now, just because his viewpoint isn't the same as ours is no reason that he's wrong.
SUPMALE:And besides, what's so bad about not wanting to fight? What do you think I should do? Now, whatever you think is right, but I'm not sure that the best way is dressing up like a dead cowboy.
LEADMALE:I can be a pirate, then.
SUPFEMALE:( laughing ) Wrong eye.
LEADMALE:Argh! Shift the mizzenmast and swab up that poop.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
OTHERMALE:I should get out of town.
LEADMALE:Here, go find a wig.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I have had it.
LEADMALE:Three days, and that George is still in front of the house.
SUPFEMALE:He hasn't moved.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes, he has.
LEADMALE:He's right outside.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Quick, quick, you can hide under there.
SUPMALE:Hey, you're getting good at this, too.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really going to get him this time.
LEADMALE:He'll never even see me.
SUPFEMALE:GEORGE: Where is he? Well, you see, he saw you coming, and he was so scared that he left town.
SUPMALE:I bet he did run away.
LEADMALE:He's probably scared out of his wits, if he has any.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Mork isn't afraid of you.
SUPMALE:I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
SUPMALE:And what if I don't? Then tomorrow, you're going to blow this oboe out your ear! Okay, I'm going but you tell that coward that I'll be waiting for him at The Eatery, and if he doesn't show up, I'll get him no matter where he hides.
LEADFEMALE:So, what's for dinner? Dad, Grandma, I'd like to speak with Mork alone for a minute.
LEADMALE:Yes, I understand, dear.
LEADFEMALE:That guy was lucky he didn't throw a punch at me.
SUPFEMALE:Not half as lucky as you are.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I knew somebody was lucky.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, this is difficult for me to say.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you should hum it, then.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, look, throughout this whole thing, I've been trying not to tell you what you should do, but now George is starting to bother all of us, and it-it's starting to look like you're just afraid of him.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I'm no coward.
OTHERFEMALE:I just believe that violence is humiliating.
SUPFEMALE:That's all.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I believe that's true, but the way you're acting, I can't help but think that You're ashamed of me, aren't you? No.
LEADMALE:Yes, you are.
OTHERMALE:And Mork from Ork has never been called a coward.
OTHERMALE:I've never even lost a holitacker, except for that one on Serius, and how can you trust an eight-legged Pekinese as an umpire? Look, Mork, you don't have to prove anything to me.
LEADMALE:Yes, I do, and I will.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going down there, and I'm going to make that guy humiliate himself if he has to tear off all of my limbs to do it.
SUPMALE:( whistles ) Where is he! Ow Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:So, you ready to fight? Oh, no but I'm ready to let you make a fool out of yourself.
SUPFEMALE:Just how are you going to do that? By standing up to you.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, what are you doing? I'm going to make my stand sitting down.
LEADFEMALE:I can't fight you like that.
LEADFEMALE:Lucky for you.
OTHERMALE:All right, you want to play cute? ( in a baby voice ): Okay.
SUPMALE:( babbles ) ( groans ) Tide's up.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:( gasps ): Leave him alone! Mindy, don't interrupt.
LEADMALE:George and I were just having a little discussion.
SUPFEMALE:Good point.
OTHERMALE:Mork, he's humiliating you.
LEADMALE:Oh, au contraire, ma petite.
LEADFEMALE:I've got that sucker on the run right now.
LEADFEMALE:Get up.
SUPFEMALE:I feel real sorry for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on now, George, don't go and mess up the place.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going to mess anything up except him.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you lay off the guy? You can see he isn't going to fight.
LEADMALE:ALL: Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what is it with you people? You never gave me a hard time before.
LEADFEMALE:And nobody ever stood up to you before.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Lumpy.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, listen, I could care less about this idiot.
OTHERFEMALE:All I ever wanted to do was have a dance with Mindy here.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think she wants to dance with you.
SUPFEMALE:I think her exact words were, "That guy is a stupid creep".
LEADMALE:I've had enough out of you, chump.
SUPFEMALE:Now you've had it.
LEADFEMALE:You can go ahead and do what you want to do, but I'm not going to fight.
LEADMALE:( groans ): Look, Lumpy, the Supremes.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what'd you do that for? He started it.
LEADMALE:He started nothing.
LEADFEMALE:He wasn't even going to fight.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, big man.
OTHERMALE:I mean, what's next George? You're going to go step on some baby chicks? MORK: You see George? I've got the support of the people.
LEADMALE:I win.
LEADMALE:( cheering ) Shut up all of you! Now this whole thing started because I wanted to dance with Mindy here, and that's exactly what I'm going to do.
LEADFEMALE:MINDY: Cut it out! I can't allow that, George.
OTHERMALE:Look, all right, I will dance with you.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, why don't you just go home? No.
LEADFEMALE:You leave her alone.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? You going to stop me? Mm yes, I am.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:You've got very lovely teeth, George.
SUPMALE:What?! Really, you probably floss, don't you? You're crazy! No, you're crazy if you don't floss.
SUPMALE:I'm going to smash your face in right now.
LEADFEMALE:I've got to warn you, you're going to humiliate yourself.
SUPMALE:I'm awfully fast.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? I've beaten guys who were fast.
LEADMALE:Oh, not this fast.
LEADMALE:I'm into time warps.
LEADMALE:I don't care if you're into kung-fu.
LEADFEMALE:( whooshing sound ) ( whooshing sound ) Hey, where'd he go? I'm over here, Clone Prince.
LEADMALE:( whooshing sound ) ( whistling ) La, la, la, la, la Stereo.
LEADFEMALE:( slow laughing ) La, la, la, la, la ( high-pitched voice ): Hello, you like me here, too? La, la, la ( garbled humming ) This is too humiliating for you.
SUPFEMALE:Please, make me stop.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on here? He's making a fool out of you.
SUPMALE:Face it, George, he's too fast.
LEADMALE:He's just playing with you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? We'll see who's playing with who! Whom.
OTHERFEMALE:( whooshing sound ) Bon appetit Oh ( whistles ) Again? ( whooshing sound ) Oh, this is too painful for me.
SUPMALE:Please stop making me humiliate you.
OTHERFEMALE:Well okay.
SUPFEMALE:Will you say you're sorry to Mindy? I'm sorry, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Boy, am I ever sorry.
SUPMALE:Then it's over.
OTHERMALE:Bartender, spam for everybody! Mork, that was the most incredible thing I've ever seen.
LEADFEMALE:How did you do that? I don't know I think I'm a little out of shape.
LEADFEMALE:I think I pulled a frontal lobe.
SUPMALE:It was absolutely amazing.
SUPFEMALE:You I mean, you-you beat him without hurting him, and you protected me.
OTHERFEMALE:You deserve a big kiss for that one, boy.
LEADMALE:( whooshing sound ) Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in Orson.
LEADFEMALE:ORSON: What are you doing? Oh, I was doing a little shadowboxing.
LEADMALE:Since there are no shadows in my mind, I was punching thoughts.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know you had any.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Just one, and the little sucker's hiding in my subconscious.
LEADMALE:( snarls ) Whoa.
LEADMALE:Why are you fighting? You know violence is against Orkan law.
LEADMALE:Oh, I know that, but I'm trying to fit in here on Earth, because these are a very violent, violent people.
SUPMALE:You mean, they have wars? Oh, no, worse than that.
SUPMALE:Violence is part of their everyday lives.
LEADMALE:First of all, they slash prices.
LEADMALE:They drown their sorrows.
SUPMALE:They punch buttons, and they kill time.
LEADMALE:I'm not even going to tell you what they do to eggs.
LEADMALE:I had no idea Earthlings were so vicious.
LEADMALE:Oh, not only that.
LEADFEMALE:They blow up photographs.
LEADFEMALE:They hang plants.
LEADFEMALE:And I heard one guy telling another guy, "Hey, man, you can crash at my place.
LEADMALE:" And even when they're finished having a fight and they want to make up, they threaten to bury the hatchet.
LEADMALE:What makes them so violent? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I think it starts when a baby is born.
SUPMALE:The first thing the doctor does is hit it.
LEADMALE:( whines like a baby ) They don't stand a chance, Your Immenseness.
SUPMALE:This is Mork, signing off.
SUPMALE:Until next week, nanu-nanu.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! ( guitar strings twang ) ( sighs ) ( door knocker tapping ) Come in.
OTHERFEMALE:La cucaracha, la cucaracha.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, honey.
SUPMALE:Hello, darling.
LEADMALE:No, not you, her.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:What'cha doing? I'm restringing a guitar.
OTHERMALE:How about you? Oh Mindy and I are going nit-picking.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, don't you mean "picnicking"? Oh, now you're nit-picking.
LEADMALE:Anyway, we thought we'd go up to Boulder Lake and have a picnic.
LEADFEMALE:Ahh.
LEADFEMALE:I've got ham sandwiches and hot chocolate in there.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and I see Mork has the blanket and the, uh, pepper? No, ants.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy said no picnic is complete without them.
OTHERMALE:Those ants are revolting.
LEADFEMALE:No, they're happy with their form of government.
OTHERFEMALE:You see, the little suckers are just dancing.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, we stopped by because we want you and Grandma to come with us.
LEADMALE:I've got plenty of food.
LEADFEMALE:And plenty of ants.
OTHERMALE:Well, honey, I'd love to go, but your grandmother isn't feeling too well.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, what's wrong? Well, you remember her friend Barney? Oh, yeah, he's the one she plays gin rummy with.
LEADMALE:Was.
LEADFEMALE:He passed away Friday night, and Cora's taking it very hard.
SUPMALE:MINDY: Oh, that's terrible.
LEADMALE:FRED: Yeah, especially since Barney was four years younger than Cora.
SUPFEMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Hudson, want to buy a guitar? No strings attached.
LEADMALE:( honking bark ) No, thank you, Mork.
LEADMALE:I'm just looking for my glasses.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Whoa, you're right.
LEADMALE:I don't think I've ever seen her this depressed.
LEADFEMALE:She's just not herself.
OTHERMALE:For three days now she hasn't even called me a wiener.
LEADMALE:Why is Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Hudson so sad? Well, it's probably because she's lonely, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:She just doesn't have too many friends her own age.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, on my planet, the elders have all the friends they want.
LEADFEMALE:Well, here it's a little bit different.
OTHERMALE:Lots of people, especially the young ones, ignore their elders.
LEADMALE:But they're the ones with all the knowledge and experience.
LEADFEMALE:On Ork, they're always being surrounded by young people.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we have the same thing in our big cities it's called mugging.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just not easy being old.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Hudson seems so lonely, I'd like to do something to help.
LEADMALE:What does she want to do, and I'll do it with her? Oh, that's really sweet, Mork, but see the problem is that she needs somebody her own age.
LEADMALE:Look, why don't you two kids go have your picnic.
LEADFEMALE:I'll restring Cora's guitar and maybe that'll make her feel better.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, listen, Dad, I'll call after we're done just to see how Grandma's doing.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:I'm sure that'll cheer her up.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Bye, Grandma.
LEADMALE:Hey, they ran away.
OTHERMALE:Ants.
LEADFEMALE:Ants.
SUPMALE:Ants! He said he didn't like them.
SUPFEMALE:Look, he's dancing with them.
SUPFEMALE:MINDY: Well, I'm going to go in the back and see if I can cheer Grandma up.
LEADFEMALE:If anybody comes in, uh, just yell.
LEADMALE:( screaming ) You said, yell.
LEADMALE:You okay, Mork? Certainly, my main munchkin.
LEADFEMALE:What's action, plasma? Eeh, eeh, eeh, eeh, eeh.
OTHERFEMALE:Eeh, eeh.
LEADMALE:( high-pitched beep ) Eugene, I Eugene, I want to ask you a question.
LEADMALE:Sure.
OTHERMALE:That's one of the things I like about you.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone else is always telling me stuff, you're the only one who asks me anything.
LEADMALE:What's happening? What do old people do for fun? Well, my mother's pretty old, she's 31 and she likes watching soap operas on TV.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, I mean a lot older, like Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Hudson.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you mean over 40.
LEADMALE:I don't think they have any fun.
SUPFEMALE:Why? I don't know, maybe it's a law.
OTHERFEMALE:What do they do then? They hang out by the parks and the museums.
LEADMALE:What makes those places so special? They're free.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:What do they do at the park? They feed the pigeons.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I got to go in for my lesson.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for the information, my man.
OTHERFEMALE:Any time.
LEADMALE:What it was.
LEADFEMALE:What it shall be.
OTHERFEMALE:One day.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:( door opening ) Hey, good lookin'.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy's not in.
LEADMALE:Who's Mindy? I'm talking to you, brown eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, why, what can I do to help you? Oh, you can walk up and down my back in a flimsy kimono.
LEADFEMALE:Hubba-hubba-hubba-hubba! Oh, why I don't even know your name.
SUPFEMALE:And besides, my kimono's at the cleaners.
SUPMALE:Oh, shazbot.
OTHERMALE:But maybe you can show me something in an Ethiopian lip whistle.
LEADMALE:A harmonica.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ): Oh, certainly.
LEADFEMALE:Follow me.
LEADMALE:Oh! Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Must be jelly 'cause jam don't shake like that.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, uh, what key would you like it in? "Q.
SUPMALE:" Oh, we don't have it in the key of "Q.
LEADMALE:" Well, then, you pick one you like.
LEADMALE:Uh, let's see, uh Uh, how about the key of "C"? How about dinner? Oh.
LEADMALE:( giggles ) Well, uh, ( clears throat ) no, I'm having Moo Goo spaghetti.
OTHERFEMALE:( giggles ): Or whatever.
LEADMALE:Well, you see, I'm pre-indisposed.
SUPMALE:Oh, cara mia, you're beautiful when you're tongue-tied.
SUPMALE:( giggles ) Do you, uh, do you know "Lady of Spain"? Oh, is the Pope Polish? Now that will be $5.
LEADMALE:29.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:$5.
SUPMALE:29.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Boy, I can remember when these things used to be ( cash register rings ) I forget.
OTHERFEMALE:( honking bark ) Would you like to have that wrapped? Oh, no thanks, I'll play it here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:How about you and me blow this Popsicle stand? Where are you going? To the museum.
OTHERMALE:I've never been to the museum.
LEADMALE:Oh, come along, sweet pea.
LEADMALE:We can't keep those statues waiting.
SUPMALE:This time of year the fig leaves begin to fall.
OTHERMALE:Oh, we'd make a peach of a pair, oh I know you cantaloupe, but oh, honeydew.
LEADFEMALE:( giggling ) Oh, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Why, I don't even know your name.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, hah, ah, that's a good question.
SUPMALE:Um Hohner.
LEADMALE:Bill C.
LEADFEMALE:Hohner.
SUPMALE:Oh, how do you do, Mr.
SUPMALE:Hohner? My friends just call me "Marine Man.
SUPMALE:" ( giggling ) On the way to the museum, we'll stop by this wonderful delicatessen and pick up some munchettoes.
OTHERMALE:Oh, wonderful.
SUPMALE:I'm starving.
LEADMALE:Oh, not for us.
SUPMALE:For the pigeons.
OTHERFEMALE:( both laughing ) ( playing gentle melody on harmonica ) Ah, Mindy, our little girl is growing up.
LEADMALE:Yes, soon she'll be leaving the nest.
OTHERMALE:Really, you two are impossible.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, us? You're the one that's been taking the long lunch hours.
LEADMALE:Yes, and I'd hate for your granddaughter to find out how late you've been rolling in these past two nights.
LEADFEMALE:Now, the museum closes at 9:00, and I've been home by 10:00, haven't I? Yes, but the museum is only four blocks away.
LEADMALE:I want to know what you've been doing between 9:00 and 10:00, hmm? Well, we're not exactly spring chickens, you know.
SUPFEMALE:We don't just skip along the sidewalk.
SUPMALE:Why are you being so secretive about all this? Well, I think a person should keep one's personal life personal.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Who's the one that always wants to know every last detail when I go on a date, hmm? Right.
LEADMALE:Turnabout is fair play, so tell us everything.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, so far, we have gone to the museum.
LEADMALE:And? Uh-huh? And to the park, to feed the pigeons.
LEADFEMALE:And what else have you been doing? Dad, she doesn't have to answer that question.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that's all right, dear, I'll answer him.
LEADMALE:None of your business, Fredzo.
LEADMALE:Isn't that nice, she's back to normal.
LEADFEMALE:Even if she is hiding something.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think it's wonderful.
LEADMALE:You know, Grandma, you've been like a new woman these last few days.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? Oh, absolutely.
SUPFEMALE:And Mindy and I are dying to meet the man who's responsible.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it just so happens he's coming to take me to lunch.
SUPFEMALE:Lunch? Good grief, my chicken potpie.
LEADFEMALE:You know, now I might not know what I'm talking about, but listen to your heart.
LEADMALE:You know, sometimes when you listen to your head, logic gets in the way of things.
SUPMALE:You're right you don't know what you're talking about.
SUPMALE:I know I'm meddling, but I just want what's right for you and Bill.
LEADMALE:Oh, everything's fine dear.
LEADFEMALE:Only there's something about him.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I know, I know.
LEADMALE:I feel the same way about John Travolta.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No dear, what I mean is, there's something kind of, well, familiar about him.
OTHERMALE:( knocking on door ) Oh, that's probably Bill now.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go get my coat.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you must be Bill.
OTHERMALE:I'm Mindy, Cora's granddaughter.
LEADMALE:Oh, charmed.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Dad, this is Bill.
SUPMALE:Take a hike.
LEADMALE:( honking bark ) Just kidding.
SUPFEMALE:You know something? You've made my mother-in-law very happy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, she's like a kid again, and we really want to thank you for that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, since I've made you both so happy, and you don't mind what's happening between Cora and me, I want to share with you a little secret.
OTHERMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:Where did you hear that? On Ork, I'm known as Mork.
OTHERMALE:( honking bark ) I'm ready, Bill.
LEADFEMALE:Did-did you have a nice chat? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:And I hope that-that Bill and I get a chance to chat again.
SUPFEMALE:Real soon.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADMALE:Looks like I'm up the big creek without locomotion.
OTHERMALE:( television plays quietly ) ( door closing ) Hold it right there, Casanova.
SUPMALE:Casanova? I've heard of supernova, Chevy Nova, bossa nova ( honking bark ) And you're not going to get out of this one by acting dumb.
LEADMALE:But I wasn't acting.
SUPMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Hudson and I had a wonderful time today.
LEADFEMALE:We started off by escorting a Boy Scout across the street.
SUPMALE:We had to drag him away from his mother to do it.
LEADFEMALE:Then we played chicken with kids on skate boards.
LEADMALE:Finally, we inched our way up Main Street.
LEADFEMALE:Backed up traffic all the way to Utah.
SUPMALE:We were real scamps.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, how could you do such a thing? Oh, change my age? With my Orkan age machine.
LEADMALE:I set the controls for senile, subtract two.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not talking about the mechanics of what you did.
SUPMALE:I want to know why you did such a horrible thing to Grandma.
SUPFEMALE:How could it be horrible when it makes her so happy? She's only happy because she thinks that you are an old man.
LEADMALE:But when I use my age machine, I am an old man.
LEADFEMALE:You're being unfair to my grandmother.
LEADFEMALE:How could it be unfair? She was sad, I made her happy.
LEADFEMALE:Therefore, how can you call it unfair? What if she falls in love with you? Now, you certainly aren't going to marry her, and that might break her heart.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you see, you could be doing more harm than good? Uh-oh.
LEADMALE:Sudden realization.
SUPMALE:Mork the Good is suddenly Mork the Bozo.
SUPFEMALE:Better call a travel agent and book a heavy guilt trip.
SUPMALE:How could I do such a dumb thing? Oh, Mork, your intentions were good.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but there's a saying on Ork.
LEADFEMALE:"The road to Earth is paved with good intentions.
LEADFEMALE:" I'm a real nimnul.
LEADMALE:( nasally groan ) To my face! But how can I solve the problem, though? Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Hudson and I have a date tomorrow night.
SUPFEMALE:I guess you're just going to have to break up.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm already pretty broken up right now.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you're going to have to tell her that you're not going to see her anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Oh boy, and is that going to be hard.
LEADFEMALE:I think she really likes that old man.
LEADFEMALE:Eugene I thought you'd never get here.
SUPFEMALE:What's up, Mork? I need to ask your advice again.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do the best I can, but you got to understand, I have my limitations.
SUPFEMALE:I'm only ten years old.
LEADMALE:You're the only one I can ask.
LEADMALE:What about Dear Abby? She knows everything.
OTHERMALE:I've read her advice, and how can you trust a woman who begins her letters, "Dear Puzzled?" Okay, lay it on me.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Let's say someone likes you very much, and you want to end the relationship? How do you do it? Tell them to take a hike.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Effective, but cruel.
SUPMALE:How do you do it if you don't want to hurt their feelings? Mork, there must be 50 ways to leave your lover.
SUPFEMALE:But I only need seven or eight.
LEADFEMALE:Lay it on me, my main munchkin.
SUPFEMALE:Well, one is, you slip out the back, Jack.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:"Slip back, Jack.
SUPMALE:" Make a new plan, Stan.
LEADMALE:Uh plan, Stan.
LEADFEMALE:Just drop off the key, Lee.
LEADMALE:Key Lee? Oh, Chinese wisdom.
LEADFEMALE:( speaking Chinese ) And get yourself free.
LEADMALE:Munchkin, you are wise beyond your height.
LEADMALE:Well, one thing you got to remember: Don't let those chicks railroad you into anything.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Funny planet, where chickens run the railroad.
LEADMALE:Boy, I certainly hope Mork can bring this off.
LEADMALE:Oh, I know he can do it.
SUPFEMALE:I just hope he doesn't break Grandma's heart.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm, Bill isn't here yet.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you look very nice tonight, Cora.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, your hair looks so pretty.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, I just washed it.
LEADFEMALE:( laughter, knock at door ) Oh, that must be Bill.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'll get that.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hello.
SUPFEMALE:Guacamole, SeÃ±orita.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, none for you until you pluck your hand.
SUPFEMALE:( laughs ) Oh, hello, Bill.
OTHERMALE:Oh, sweet one.
OTHERFEMALE:You better make this good.
SUPFEMALE:No pressure.
LEADMALE:Um, well, I, uh, guess I'll go, uh, practice my trombone solo.
LEADMALE:I'll help.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Here, Bill, come on, sit down.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, aren't those lovely! Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Um Uh, Bill There's something I want to There's something I have to s ( laughs ) Psychic.
OTHERMALE:Yes, age before beauty.
LEADMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:Pearls before swine.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, go ahead.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Kay-o.
LEADMALE:Cora, there's something I have to say to you, and I'll try and make it as quick and painless as possible.
LEADFEMALE:The-The painless is easy.
LEADMALE:At my age, the quick is the hard part.
LEADFEMALE:( high-pitched laugh ) Mm.
LEADMALE:Cora, after careful consideration, I've decided to slip out my back, Jackson.
LEADMALE:Which is to say, I'm going to make a new plan, Chuck.
LEADFEMALE:Which includes dropping off the key.
LEADMALE:In summation, I'm going to get myself free.
SUPFEMALE:What I'm trying to say, Cora, is, this is hello.
LEADFEMALE:I-I haven't understood a word you just said.
LEADMALE:I should have asked him for the other 46 ways.
LEADMALE:Never mind.
LEADMALE:Come and sit down, because it's my turn to talk.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Now, first of all, I want to thank you for helping me through a very rough time.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, rough time? About Oh.
LEADFEMALE:And the other thing I want to tell you is, I know who you are, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Shazbot! How did you find me out? Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:If you were really old, the kay-o would have been followed by a pectate.
LEADMALE:I'm-I'm a real nimnul then.
LEADFEMALE:Oh no, you're not.
LEADFEMALE:You're wonderful.
LEADMALE:( laughs ) I really began to suspect that day we went to the museum.
SUPMALE:Remember that piece of art work that you liked? Oh, yes.
OTHERFEMALE:That lovely metallic sculpture.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:That was an air conditioner.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:And then last night when we were lost, you asked directions from a pine tree.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:He got us there, didn't he? ( laughs ) ( high-pitched laugh ) But only Mork could do those things.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Well, I-I guess you don't like me anymore.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, how can you say that? Of course I like you.
SUPMALE:Why, I-I like you more than ever.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you realize you you snapped me out of a blue funk? You've made me realize that I-I have a family that-that cares about me, and and a good job, and-and lots of friends of all ages.
SUPFEMALE:I'll always be your friend, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Hudson.
SUPFEMALE:( laughs ) Why don't you call me Grandma? Kay-o, and hold the pectate.
OTHERMALE:( laughs ) But you know, there's one thing that still bothers me.
LEADMALE:Last night when I tweaked your cheek, I did it to see if you were wearing makeup.
LEADFEMALE:And you weren't.
SUPMALE:It's as if you really have become an old man.
SUPMALE:Temporarily, I am.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:There's no way on Earth you could do that.
SUPFEMALE:You're beginning to get the idea.
LEADMALE:Cora, there's something I have to tell you, and you better take this one sitting down.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:( squeaks ): Oh! Cora, I have to tell you something 'cause I respect you, 'cause you're getting too close to hide it anymore.
SUPFEMALE:I'm from another planet.
OTHERMALE:( high-pitched eerie humming ) I'm an alien being.
SUPFEMALE:Nanu.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you want to hear something weird? Lay it on me.
LEADFEMALE:I believe you.
LEADFEMALE:( high-pitched ): Aha! Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Why, I should have known when you when you carved our initials on that tree with-with your finger.
LEADMALE:I can drink with the sucker, too! Oh, what a relief.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, ever since you moved in with Mindy, I was seeing things that, well, made me think my mind was going.
LEADMALE:But now, well, of course, it's so simple.
SUPFEMALE:A man from outer space.
LEADFEMALE:You accept it so easily.
SUPMALE:Most people just look at me and say, "Bull!" ( high-pitched utterance ) Oh, Mork, I've been around a long time.
LEADMALE:I've seen the age of the automobile and radio and talking movies, and I've seen a man walk on the moon.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if we can go there, there's no reason you can't come here.
LEADMALE:Then I can return back to my normal age, and you'll still be my friend? Oh, of course.
LEADMALE:Let's shake.
LEADFEMALE:( goofy growling ) ( high-pitched laugh ) ( laughs ) But there's one other thing, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:If you can make yourself old, could you make another person young? No.
LEADMALE:Shazbot! ( high-pitched laugh ) ( laughter ) Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Ziz, bah, ziz, bah, ziz, bah ORSON: What are you doing? Push-downs.
LEADMALE:It's a common form of Earth exercise.
LEADMALE:Here's another one.
LEADMALE:We must, we must, we must build up the bust.
LEADMALE:Why this sudden interest in exercise? Well, I aged myself.
LEADFEMALE:I'm still a little stiff.
SUPMALE:You aged yourself? That's a cheap way to get respect.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, it's different here, Orson.
LEADMALE:Here the young people get all the attention.
LEADFEMALE:What do young people know? They don't have the experience.
LEADFEMALE:That doesn't make sense.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:I don't understand it myself.
LEADFEMALE:Everything else here gets more valuable as it gets older wine, cheese, furniture, coins.
LEADMALE:Everything except people.
LEADMALE:Here they ignore their ancient ones, Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:They don't do anything nice for them? Well, they do one nice thing.
LEADFEMALE:They fix their income.
LEADMALE:But why do they treat their elders like that? Unlike us, as they get older, their bodies fall into a state of disrepair.
LEADMALE:The first thing to go is their hearing.
SUPFEMALE:What? ( louder ): The first thing to go is their hearing.
OTHERFEMALE:Why is that, Mork? Well, I have a theory about that.
LEADMALE:I feel it's because no one asks them anything.
LEADFEMALE:Such a waste.
OTHERFEMALE:This is Mork, signing off until next week.
LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! Hi, Mork.
SUPMALE:Be calm.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Everything is going to be all right, but just start packing, okay?! What? We've got to get out.
LEADFEMALE:We're going to blow this burg.
SUPMALE:It's over.
OTHERMALE:The party's over! Boulder's had it.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? There's a plague! It's an epidemic.
SUPMALE:It's called Christmas! Oh the Christmas plague.
SUPFEMALE:You know about it.
LEADMALE:It affects the brain.
SUPMALE:There're mindless hordes all out in the street milling around.
LEADMALE:Last night, while you were at school, there was a roving gang terrorizing the neighborhood.
OTHERMALE:They were just singing for trouble.
SUPMALE:Singing for trouble? Yes, they wanted to beat up Monty Hall and his family.
LEADFEMALE:They were going from house to house singing, "Deck the halls, deck the halls" Mork, those are Christmas carolers.
SUPFEMALE:They're harmless.
LEADMALE:Oh, a lot you know.
OTHERFEMALE:Quick! We've got to get you out of here! The whole town's under martial law.
SUPFEMALE:There's a little fat dude in a red suit on every corner and he's called, he's called Santa Claus.
SUPMALE:And he's stopping everybody! And people are really sick 'cause they're putting plastic babies on everybody's lawn covered in straw.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, but we've got to get out of here before we're all infected! Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Relax.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, this might be hard for you to understand, but it's all part of our Christmas holiday.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that explains it.
LEADMALE:You see, the men in the red suits are collecting money for people that are less fortunate.
LEADFEMALE:And the carolers are singing because that makes people happy.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah? Tell that to the "Halls" after they're decked.
LEADFEMALE:You see, this holiday is to celebrate the birth of one of Earth's greatest men called Jesus Christ.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, is that the guy with the glasses that runs Boulder Stereo? No, I don't think that's him.
LEADMALE:You see, Jesus was a wise and wonderful man.
LEADFEMALE:That's why this time of year brings out the best in people.
LEADMALE:It's a time for caring and sharing, when you open up your heart to your fellow man.
LEADMALE:Oh, I see.
LEADMALE:For a few short weeks each year, humans try to act human.
LEADMALE:Well, it's a start.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it's a darn good one.
LEADMALE:Orson will be pleased to hear about this.
OTHERFEMALE:( doorbell rings ) I'll get it.
LEADMALE:( utters Orkan sounds ) Mindy, you don't have to worry about snowing tonight, because here's your fair-weather friend, Susan.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, Mork, Mork, Mork, Mork.
LEADMALE:Oh, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue.
LEADFEMALE:You're such a dear child.
LEADMALE:Well, Susan Taylor, whatever brings you into this neighborhood? After all, there's no valet parking.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy! Oh! Nonsense.
SUPFEMALE:I'd go to a tacky area to see a friend.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's nice.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:So, what brings you by? Oh, Christmas.
LEADFEMALE:You know, at Christmas you stop to think about your friends, and that's why I'm here.
LEADFEMALE:After all, you two are my best friends.
LEADFEMALE:We're your only friends.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what beautiful Christmas cards.
OTHERMALE:Where did you buy them? Oh, she didn't.
LEADMALE:One man gave them all to her.
OTHERFEMALE:Aha.
LEADMALE:The mailman.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's the guy.
LEADMALE:The one with the well-stuffed pouch.
LEADFEMALE:Did you string up your Christmas cards? Oh, sort of.
LEADFEMALE:I hung up my Christmas card.
LEADMALE:Oh, then I'll give you a card.
SUPFEMALE:Here, are you into camels? Oh, thank you, Mork, but it's just not the same.
LEADMALE:Cute camel, though.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy, your place is just so homey, not like mine.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, mine is just so gosh-darned elegant.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that it's not really the kind of place you'd like to spend Christmas in all alone.
SUPMALE:Oh, loneliness.
SUPFEMALE:Heavy sigh.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:What about that guy you're dating uh, the lawyer? Oh, Patrick.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, no, we're not going to be able to spend Christmas together.
LEADMALE:He has this silly quirk about spending the holidays with his wife.
OTHERFEMALE:That's easily fixed.
LEADMALE:Just have him come over and bring the little woman along.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, she doesn't know that I exist.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's probably why she didn't send you a card.
SUPMALE:But you have to let people know what you're doing.
LEADFEMALE:Uh! I have the solution.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you come over here for Christm Excuse me, Mork, I forgot I have to talk to you.
OTHERMALE:You were going to invite her to spend Christmas with us, weren't you? Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:I got the right idea.
SUPMALE:I think fast.
SUPMALE:I want to spend Christmas with you, Dad and Grandma.
SUPFEMALE:So does she.
LEADMALE:But I don't want to spend it with her.
LEADFEMALE:Why? You told me Christmas was a time of caring and sharing, a time when you open up your heart to your fellow man or strange woman.
SUPMALE:What made you change your mind? I didn't change my mind.
OTHERFEMALE:I just Oh, you don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:I think I do understand.
SUPFEMALE:You didn't mean what you said.
LEADFEMALE:It was a nice idea, though, this But I guess this Christmas is just a sham.
LEADMALE:No, I mean, it's still a nice idea, but she's just so ( disgusting groan ).
LEADMALE:And her ego is so inflated.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, all right, ask her.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Susan, even though you're yech! And inflated, would you like to spend Christmas over here? Well, I suppose I could change my plans.
SUPMALE:Swell.
OTHERFEMALE:Gee, I forgot.
SUPMALE:I can't.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's too bad.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe next year.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm a nooner.
LEADFEMALE:I could never possibly get here in time for the festivities.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Well, I'll wake you up.
LEADMALE:Well, if it's that important to you, I suppose I could come over and spend Christmas Eve here, and then you could wake me up in time for the fun in the morning.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, you win.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you for thinking of us.
LEADMALE:What are friends for? Well, listen, I really do I do prefer to have the Christmas meal around 1:00.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, fair warning: I only eat white meat.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess we'll have to get a Caucasian turkey then.
LEADMALE:Oh, we're going to have such fun.
SUPMALE:Ciao.
SUPFEMALE:Grub.
LEADFEMALE:See, Mindy, aren't you glad we did the right thing? ( knock on door ) MORK: In come.
LEADFEMALE:Eugene! What's action, faction? Uh-uh-uh.
SUPMALE:What's this? A tree.
LEADMALE:A tree in bondage? Eugene, you're weird.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you dragging this dead thing around? Haven't you seen a Christmas tree before? Oh, a Christmas tree.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:Man, sometimes you act like you're from another world.
LEADMALE:It's a Christmas tree.
LEADMALE:You decorate it.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Well, Mork, there are certain things you do on Christmas.
SUPFEMALE:One, decorate the tree.
LEADMALE:Two, eat turkey.
LEADFEMALE:Three, exchange gifts.
LEADMALE:Whoa, munchkin.
SUPMALE:Run the gift part by me again.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, Mindy'll buy you something.
SUPFEMALE:And probably her Dad and Grandma.
OTHERMALE:Oh, and ipso facto, I'm supposed to buy them something.
LEADMALE:Now you got it.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, what a pleasant tradition.
SUPFEMALE:SUSAN ( sing-song ): Knock, knock Who's there? Susan.
LEADMALE:Susan who? Susan Taylor.
OTHERFEMALE:What a terrible knock-knock joke.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, I'm so full of the essence of Christmas.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like you to meet my main munchkin, Eugene.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, I am so thrilled.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, there.
LEADMALE:I am so thrilled that you and Mindy have invited me to spend this special time of the year with you that, well, I've decided to share with you one of my most cherished possessions.
LEADFEMALE:A heavenly top piece for our tree my Gucci angel.
LEADMALE:Well, any friend of yours is a friend of ours and your winged guest is welcome here.
LEADFEMALE:Fly, little friend, be free! Oh, heavy remorse.
OTHERFEMALE:I've killed your flighty friend.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:It was your most prized possession.
SUPMALE:That's all right.
LEADFEMALE:I have six more at home.
LEADMALE:Well, I must fly.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, think of your friend.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that reminds me.
SUPFEMALE:I'll drop off another angel with Mindy later.
SUPFEMALE:Ciao.
LEADMALE:Pekinese.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, she's something else.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I like her, too.
SUPFEMALE:Eugene, would you come with me and help me pick out presents for the family? Sure.
LEADMALE:But I gotta tell you something.
LEADFEMALE:That lady friend of yours has the wrong idea about Christmas.
LEADMALE:She does? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Getting presents is nice, but giving presents is what the gig's all about.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, like Mindy said, caring and sharing.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:It's the time of the year when everyone's full of brotherly love.
LEADMALE:Will you let go?! I saw it first! I got more of it! No, you haven't! Hey, girlie, can you help me? Come back here! Come back here! WOMAN: You had plenty yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you have one with green? Mork?! Mork?! Eugene! You can't buy anything under there.
LEADMALE:Come on out.
SUPMALE:Oh, no way, Jose.
OTHERMALE:Nyet, nix.
LEADFEMALE:I'm no chump.
SUPMALE:These people are out for blood.
SUPFEMALE:I'd rather go swimming in a blender.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Mork, here comes a salesman.
LEADFEMALE:Can I help you? You can help me.
LEADMALE:What? He's scared to come out.
SUPFEMALE:Will you come out of there right now! No! Face it like a man! Hey, everybody, there's a sale on the second floor.
OTHERMALE:That's right, 110% off.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I had to save myself, and besides I all I want is just a sweater.
OTHERMALE:It's all right.
SUPFEMALE:They'll be back when they find out there's no second floor.
SUPMALE:What kind of sweater do you want? Well, I'd like to go big-time maybe.
LEADMALE:Cardin, Yves St.
LEADMALE:Laurent.
OTHERMALE:I've got 12 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, I've got to buy three presents with that or four, including Susan.
OTHERFEMALE:Twelve bucks, huh? I've got an idea for you, friend.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you do your shopping at McDonald's? All right, Eugene, we're off to the Golden Arches.
LEADMALE:Mork, he was putting you on.
LEADMALE:Oh, I guess 12 bucks doesn't buy very nice presents then.
SUPMALE:Not for that many people.
OTHERFEMALE:Too bad.
SUPMALE:At home we used to make presents for people Sure, you can do that.
SUPMALE:I thought that's against the law.
LEADFEMALE:You know, because on TV they say you've got to buy everything.
LEADMALE:It's part of the commercialization of Christmas, you know.
LEADMALE:The stores would rather you buy them.
LEADMALE:There's no reason you can't make them.
OTHERMALE:Oh oh, yay, excitement, tingle.
SUPFEMALE:I've got to get the material then.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see, what do we need? We need lots of gum ball of string some dust balls, a little tiny whip.
SUPFEMALE:MORK: Mindy, guess what? What? I have a surprise for you.
SUPMALE:I've hid your present all over the house.
SUPMALE:You'll never be able Don't sit there! Why did you hide your presents? Why didn't you just put them under the tree? I didn't want you to see them.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't you wrap them? You're supposed to wrap your presents? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:You're nothing! You're skuz! You're not worth the money! You're awful! Who would buy you in a million years?! Doesn't sound very Christmasy to me.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, look.
SUPFEMALE:See a little paper, a little ribbon, nice little bow.
LEADMALE:This is how we wrap presents.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's a lot more in the spirit of things.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Well, guess what I got for you.
SUPMALE:Go on, take a guess.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, just one guess.
LEADMALE:No, I don't want to guess.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to ruin it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, party pooper.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll guess what you got for me.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, let me guess.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Just give me a hint! Give me a hint! Give me a hint! No, Mork.
OTHERMALE:You're just going to have to wait till tomorrow morning.
LEADMALE:You know, you're just like a little kid.
LEADMALE:( high-pitched hum ) Don't don't shake it.
OTHERFEMALE:You're going to break the What? Oh cute.
LEADMALE:SUSAN: Knock-knock.
LEADFEMALE:Don't say, "Who's there?" It's a set-up for a terrible joke.
LEADFEMALE:MORK: Entre vous.
LEADMALE:Hi, there.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look at all the beautiful presents.
LEADFEMALE:How nice.
LEADMALE:I only got one gift myself this year.
OTHERFEMALE:It's from my boyfriend, Patrick.
LEADMALE:And his wife? I doubt it.
SUPFEMALE:You know what he gave me for Christmas? A picture of himself.
LEADMALE:And you opened it? No, I don't have to, I know.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I'm giving for Christmas this year.
SUPMALE:That man doesn't have a single bit of imagination.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, Susan, forget about Patrick.
LEADMALE:We're going to see that you have a really nice Christmas this year.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, we have presents even for you.
LEADMALE:That's nice.
SUPMALE:Look, I really appreciate your inviting me over here for the holidays.
SUPFEMALE:I know I kind of wangled my invitation, but, uh well, I'm really glad you invited me, and I think we're going to have a really nice Christmas.
SUPMALE:Oh, I know we are.
LEADFEMALE:Since everyone's in the Christmas spirit, let's open those presents! Now, I told you, we're going to open our presents tomorrow morning when Dad and Grandma get here.
LEADMALE:Do you think you can wait that long? Who me? Yeah, you.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Remember me? Mork the emotionless? I'm in control.
LEADMALE:Everything's cool.
SUPFEMALE:Tell you what tomorrow morning when they get here, you just give me a buzz.
LEADMALE:If the energy's right, I'll come down.
LEADFEMALE:We'll have a cocktail.
SUPFEMALE:We'll talk.
LEADMALE:'Cause you know, Christmas is really for kids.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it is getting late.
OTHERFEMALE:I think we probably should hit the sack.
LEADFEMALE:Tomorrow's going to start pretty early.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:You know, in spite of what he just said, Mork certainly seems to be excited about Christmas.
LEADMALE:Oh, he is.
LEADFEMALE:It's like it's his first one.
LEADFEMALE:You see, his, uh, parents, never celebrated Christmas.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's sad.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it is.
LEADMALE:Mork and I have a lot in common.
LEADMALE:( singing in Orkan ) ( Simon game beeping ) Catchy tune.
LEADMALE:Oh, look at this lovely brooch cameo from the antique shop.
LEADMALE:Oh, isn't it lovely? Oh, Fred, how did you know I wanted it? Well, I overheard you mention it to Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:Every day since July.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy, thank you so much for the gloves.
OTHERFEMALE:They're really nice.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you're welcome.
SUPMALE:Oh, and thank you for the lovely picture of yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:It's time for my presents now.
LEADMALE:I saved the best for last.
LEADFEMALE:( babbling ) ( whistling ) Grandma may all your Christmases be bright.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:Pops, keep those chestnuts roasting.
SUPFEMALE:Susan, this is even better than your picture.
LEADFEMALE:And Mindy, for you.
SUPFEMALE:And thanks for being such a swell roomy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, Mork.
LEADMALE:Say, this is nice.
SUPMALE:What is it? Well, you said you've always wanted a rug try it on.
LEADFEMALE:Just like Howard Cosell, and it's indoor/outdoor.
LEADMALE:Um a-a painting? Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:You said you liked music and antiques, so I combined the two and I made a portrait of Liberace made out of old bubble gum.
OTHERMALE:I painted each wad myself.
LEADMALE:Well, it's, um it's unusual.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I knew you'd like it.
LEADMALE:Gee, I can't wait to see what I got.
LEADFEMALE:Well, yours is the only one I bought, 'cause you said you wanted something returnable.
LEADMALE:A saucer? Surprised? Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:Uh, why a saucer? Well, Mindy said you'd only appreciate something shallow.
SUPMALE:Well, it it's a bracelet.
LEADMALE:No, it's a lawnmower.
SUPMALE:Of course, it's a bracelet.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:It's handmade by Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh it's really interesting.
LEADMALE:What kind of beads are these? Oh, they're not beads, and I know you'll love it, because there's a whole collection up in the attic.
LEADMALE:They're flies.
LEADMALE:They can't fly now, silly, they're dead.
SUPFEMALE:And look, I hand-painted each and every one of their eyes which was really a drag, took a long time and I made, I made little clothing for them.
LEADMALE:Little pants, too.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look, look his human's open.
LEADMALE:And if you look real close and you hold them up to the light, you can see I put sequins on the wings so they could look like Liza Minelli in Cabaret.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't it incredible? I knew you'd like it.
OTHERMALE:Oh It was just worth it just to see the surprised look on your face.
LEADMALE:Well, I-I appreciate the fact that it took you so long to make that.
LEADMALE:Um, could you put that in the box for me? Oh, you know why I put it in such a big box? Why? So you couldn't guess what it was.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ) Did I fool you? ( honking bark ) You sure did, boy.
OTHERFEMALE:I never would have guessed what was in there.
LEADMALE:Well, did everyone like my swell gifts? ALL: Oh, yes.
SUPMALE:Well, if you liked those, wait till you see what I got for the entire house.
LEADMALE:It's something everybody can use.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, dopey me.
SUPMALE:It must be upstairs.
LEADMALE:I'll go get it.
LEADMALE:( singing in Orkan ) Will you look at this? Oh, my gosh.
SUPMALE:I agree, but what can you say to the guy? Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:What I thought was a picture from Patrick, it's a thousand dollar bill.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, I didn't get him anything because I thought he gave me a crummy picture.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I've got to think of something that I can get for him and leave it in his mailbox.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I'll leave him one of my Gucci angels.
LEADMALE:Oh, folks, now you got to admit it this is what Christmas is all about.
LEADFEMALE:Not like those stupid presents Mork made for us.
LEADFEMALE:Merry Christmas! FRED: Well, what should we do? I don't know.
SUPMALE:Poor Mork.
SUPMALE:I'm so embarrassed for him.
SUPMALE:He worked so hard on the on all this stuff.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:A rug, gum and dead flies.
LEADMALE:It's tough to warm up to.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, the poor boy.
LEADMALE:Do we tell him? I mean, we don't want him to make the same mistake next year.
SUPMALE:Dad, how do we tell him? Did you see the look on his face? MORK: You don't have to.
SUPFEMALE:I made a fool out of myself.
LEADMALE:MINDY: Mork I'm sorry I embarrassed you.
LEADMALE:I'll be up in my room.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, so your presents weren't very practical, but it doesn't matter.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, Dad's right.
SUPMALE:It's not the gift, it's the thought that counts.
SUPMALE:CORA: That's true, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:It is the thought.
LEADFEMALE:Thoughts are important? Well, of course.
LEADFEMALE:I should have given you one of those for Christmas.
OTHERFEMALE:What? A thought.
LEADMALE:You can give a thought? No, but you can give it to yourselves, I can make it happen.
OTHERMALE:Let me show you.
LEADFEMALE:( sustained tones ) I don't believe it.
OTHERMALE:What was your thought? Well, when I was a little girl, I used to have this dog named Peppy.
OTHERFEMALE:And I, I let him loose one afternoon at a picnic and-and he ran away.
LEADFEMALE:A week went by and I thought that he'd gotten run over by a car.
LEADFEMALE:And I just remember the way I felt the day that Peppy ran up the driveway.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks, Mork.
LEADMALE:What about you, Grandma? Well, I was just remembering my husband and our first Christmas together.
LEADMALE:We, uh, we couldn't afford furniture or gifts for each other, but we bought a tree.
LEADMALE:And it was the best Christmas ever.
SUPFEMALE:What's wrong, Pops? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing at all.
SUPFEMALE:You just made me remember the first time I held my newborn daughter.
LEADMALE:My hands were so large and clumsy.
LEADFEMALE:I just couldn't believe anything so tiny could make me so happy.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Mork.
LEADMALE:Me, too, Mork.
LEADMALE:Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.
SUPMALE:I'd forgotten how much I loved that dog.
SUPFEMALE:You like it better than flies? ( chuckles ) Yes, even better than flies.
LEADMALE:Whew.
LEADFEMALE:I want to say something to you, too.
OTHERFEMALE:This is my first Christmas and you made it really wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Well 
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome, friends, to the temple of suds.
SUPMALE:If you're ready now, throw down your forks and come forward and have your soul cleansed in the Joy to come.
SUPFEMALE:I've got some good news and some bad news.
LEADFEMALE:First, the bad news.
SUPMALE:This sucker's hot.
OTHERFEMALE:But now the good news.
SUPMALE:Tonight we'll be having a jacuzzi.
SUPFEMALE:Yea, yow Yea, yea.
LEADFEMALE:( mumbling ): every single time.
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
OTHERMALE:( growls ) Mindy, why are you mad at your coat? Because my watch stopped.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, and you suspect your coat? No.
SUPMALE:My watch stopped and I got a ticket.
LEADMALE:Oh, on Ork when our watch stopped we only get a warning and they take away Mickey's hands.
SUPFEMALE:See, I was parked in this no-parking-after-6:00 zone with my jeep and I got back late because of this stupid watch.
LEADMALE:I got a $15 ticket.
SUPMALE:Oh, that doesn't sound fair.
SUPMALE:It's not.
SUPMALE:Then don't pay the ticket.
LEADMALE:We're with ya.
LEADFEMALE:Right on, mama.
SUPFEMALE:I've got to, it's the law.
SUPFEMALE:Who made that law? I don't know, the town council or something.
LEADMALE:Who said they could do it? The people that voted them into office.
OTHERMALE:What people? You know, the people of Boulder Dad, Grandma, me, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, that's stupid, you voted to give yourself a ticket.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I guess indirectly I did, didn't I? See, in a democracy, everybody votes and then the majority wins.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I vote we adopt Dolly Parton.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Do I win? No, with two people, you can't have a winner.
OTHERMALE:Oh, sounds like democracy will never replace bobbing for French fries.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Mork, I'm not an authority on these things.
LEADMALE:If you have questions, you really should go out and ask other people and get other opinions.
OTHERMALE:May I ask you just one more question? Sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Why didn't I win with one vote? Well, that's because you need at least three people to vote.
SUPFEMALE:That way you've always got somebody to break the tie.
LEADFEMALE:What if someone votes twice? No, in a democracy you can only vote once.
LEADFEMALE:What a primitive system.
SUPFEMALE:On Ork, we have a much more sophisticated way.
SUPFEMALE:If somebody wants to be President, we just say, "Sure, go ahead, it's cool.
SUPFEMALE:" Grandma! Pops! Still no luck, eh? No.
LEADMALE:Mindy, I finished my observations of the migration of the North American wino, which was easy because he didn't move very far.
SUPFEMALE:I can take you home now.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, I can't.
LEADFEMALE:Susan Taylor invited me by her shop.
LEADFEMALE:She's gonna have a makeup demonstration.
LEADMALE:And she wants me to be the model.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, like the ones in Playboy.
LEADMALE:( high pitched voice ): Hi, my name is Candy.
OTHERMALE:My hobbies are body surfing and neutron physics and I hope to one day know the entire Los Angeles Rams.
LEADFEMALE:Not exactly.
LEADFEMALE:She's only working from the chin up.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Anyway, I'm gonna get a new face.
LEADFEMALE:A new face.
SUPMALE:Well, can I have your old one? ( chuckles ) Listen, I'll see you at home later.
LEADMALE:Ciao.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:One two We can play democracy.
SUPMALE:Come on, everybody's doing it.
LEADFEMALE:Do the vote! We've got three of us.
SUPMALE:We can vote on something.
LEADMALE:But we have nothing to vote on.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, we can vote to adjourn then.
LEADFEMALE:All in favor, say "ear.
LEADMALE:" That's "aye.
LEADMALE:" Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's two.
OTHERMALE:That's a majority.
LEADMALE:We win.
LEADMALE:Let's pack it in.
LEADMALE:I don't want to play.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, we'll let you vote first.
LEADMALE:We have enough to break your majority.
LEADFEMALE:( mutters ): Republican.
OTHERMALE:Want to have some fun? You can file these classical albums.
SUPMALE:I'll be in back if you need me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, let's see, albums would be under "A.
LEADMALE:" That was easy, but not fun.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, no, no, no, you don't understand.
LEADMALE:We don't fix cellos here, we sell 'em.
LEADFEMALE:This is a music store.
SUPFEMALE:( Russian accent ): Da, you keep cello.
OTHERMALE:Look, I know where you can get it fixed.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with it? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I think you could handle job.
LEADMALE:Well, look, if you change your mind, here's the address of the repair shop and good luck.
LEADMALE:Oh, very much, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:You're welcome.
LEADMALE:( speaks Russian ) Nanu-nanu.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you speak English! You speak lousy.
LEADMALE:Is because I'm not from here around.
SUPMALE:I am from very far away.
OTHERFEMALE:I am alien.
LEADMALE:Leapin' lizards, so am I! Mork from Ork.
LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:Sergei from Slavisgrad.
SUPMALE:Slavisgrad.
SUPMALE:Is that near Alpha Centuri? No.
LEADMALE:Ork, is that near Minsk? No, you got me by the shorts there.
SUPMALE:Unless that's the one with eight moons.
LEADMALE:Well, where are you living now? I do not yet find place to live.
LEADMALE:That's why I leave cello here.
SUPFEMALE:Sleeping in park is okay for me, but not for cello.
LEADMALE:I know what it's like.
LEADMALE:It was pretty hard for me when I blew into town, too.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have to make reports of what you observe here? Spy? No, I am magician and student.
LEADMALE:I play in the sympathy.
LEADFEMALE:But I don't get first paycheck for couple weeks.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're lucky.
LEADMALE:I have to report back to this fat dude named Orson.
SUPFEMALE:He's the one that made me come here.
LEADMALE:Oh, no one make Sergei Krushnev come here.
SUPMALE:I wanted to be part of this democracy, ja.
LEADMALE:You know about democracy? Oh, ya, I study this, mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Mindy and I are forming a democracy.
SUPFEMALE:Leaping lizards.
LEADFEMALE:No faking? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:And you could be a third so we can vote and I can ask you questions.
SUPFEMALE:You can come and live with us.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I don't want trouble on you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no trouble, no trouble.
LEADMALE:Mindy'll be happy when she finds out about this.
LEADMALE:Who is this Mindy? Oh, she's the girl I live with.
OTHERMALE:Are you married? No, but don't bother about it.
LEADMALE:Neither is she.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Well, what do you think? Holy Moley.
SUPMALE:Such beautiful apartment.
SUPFEMALE:You must have big bucks, huh, Mork? Bet you are American rock star, huh? Hey, do you, do you have many pairs of Levis? Ja? Listen, do you, do you know the Beach Boys? How 'bout Chuck Berry? Hey ( sings ) Long distance information Give me Memphis, Tennessee Hey! Oh.
LEADMALE:Who's your friend? Mindy McConnell, meet Sergei Krushnev.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, Sergei, Mind, Serg, Mi, Se, Mm, Ss.
SUPFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:Oh, I see you've spent some time with Mork here.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, he show me so many things about your customs, you know? ( whistles ) Sergei, Sergei, lighten up.
LEADFEMALE:So, what do you think? How do you like my new face? Oh, boy, what great country.
SUPFEMALE:You don't like face, you get new one.
SUPMALE:Ha.
SUPFEMALE:Same face, new paint job.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I knew it'd knock your socks off.
LEADMALE:So, what do you do? Oh, I am student and cello player, mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Sergei's going to be part of our democracy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's great.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, you're going to love living in this country.
LEADMALE:No, I mean our democracy.
LEADFEMALE:Sergei's gonna be our third, so we can vote.
SUPFEMALE:He's gonna live with us.
LEADFEMALE:Ja.
SUPMALE:Can I talk to you for a moment? I think we should vote on that.
SUPFEMALE:I vote no, what do you think, Sergei? I'm with you, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Two to one, you lose.
SUPMALE:( gritted teeth ): I want to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:( gritted teeth ): We just voted on that.
LEADFEMALE:( gritted teeth ): Now Oh, that's a different story.
LEADFEMALE:Please to excuse me, where may I find laboratory please for me? Oh.
SUPMALE:You mean the restroom.
LEADFEMALE:It's right through there.
LEADMALE:Oh, a bed! I never saw a restroom where you could really rest.
SUPMALE:Boy, this America, really out of state.
SUPMALE:What have you done? I got us a third for democracy.
LEADMALE:You just can't invite anyone to come live here.
LEADFEMALE:I know that.
LEADFEMALE:We'll vote on it.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, we won't.
SUPMALE:I pay the rent and I say he can't stay.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I see.
LEADFEMALE:The one with the money controls the votes.
SUPMALE:That's not it.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, you don't understand.
SUPMALE:You see, Sergei's sleeping outside on a bench and he's got a violin with a gland condition.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Mork, you can't just go and Mindy, I don't think our democracy's working too well.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's have a dictatorship instead, okay? I'll be the tyrant and you'll be the peon.
LEADMALE:Huh? Huh? Can I be the tyrant? Huh? Can I be the tyrant? Come on, now.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, this is wonderful country.
OTHERMALE:In Russia, I have to sleep with 11 brothers, but tonight, three in one bed.
SUPFEMALE:Is too much, I tell you.
LEADMALE:( singing in Orkan ) ( chanting in Orkan ) What are you doing down here in your pajamas? Well, I slept in the guest room so Sergei could have the penthouse.
LEADMALE:Can I talk to you for a minute about Sergei? You asked for it, you got it I'm listening.
SUPMALE:Look, Mork.
LEADMALE:Sergei seems like a nice guy, but you just you just can't go inviting your friends to live here.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you told me to go out and ask people questions.
LEADFEMALE:Not questions like, "Do you want to come home and live with me?" Oh, I get it.
SUPFEMALE:You feel left out.
LEADMALE:Well, you can ask one of your friends home.
LEADFEMALE:Then there'll be four of us.
LEADFEMALE:But then it wouldn't work.
LEADFEMALE:I guess democracy only works with odd numbers.
LEADMALE:That's not the point.
LEADFEMALE:He's a stranger.
LEADFEMALE:But I was a stranger and you brought me home.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, you're even stranger now.
LEADMALE:Anyway, that was a special case.
LEADFEMALE:You really needed help.
SUPMALE:Well, Sergei needs our help.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:Yes, he does.
LEADFEMALE:And you can help him find an apartment.
OTHERFEMALE:Show him around Boulder.
SUPMALE:Make him feel like he belongs.
LEADMALE:Oh, be sort of an extraterrestrial welcome wagon.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'll take some money out of my savings account and lend it to Sergei until he gets on his feet and then he can pay me back whenever he can.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you know something, Mindy? You're a real wurble.
LEADMALE:Thanks I think.
SUPMALE:Anyway, if you have any problems, you can reach me at the store.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay? Kay-o.
OTHERFEMALE:There won't be any problem.
LEADMALE:We're like two fish out of water.
SUPMALE:Yes, you are.
LEADMALE:I'll see you later.
LEADMALE:( clanging ) Come and get it 'fore I slop it to the hogs! Rocky Mountain High Cincinnati Oh, is time for vittles, ha-ha.
SUPFEMALE:( speaks Russian ) Howdy, partner.
LEADFEMALE:You like cowboy movies, too? Oh, yes.
OTHERMALE:Where I come from we love all American movies.
LEADMALE:Have seen Citizen Kane, When the Wind is Leaving, In Front of on the Water, uh, but, but my favorite is this Lonesome Ranger.
LEADMALE:I would give anything to meet Mr.
LEADMALE:Ranger.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, look, Kemo sabe, something strange, buckboard on its back.
SUPFEMALE:Ay, Tonto, you're right.
LEADMALE:with dental floss.
SUPMALE:( female voice ): Help me, Masked Man.
OTHERMALE:( male voice ): Help me, Lone Ranger.
OTHERMALE:( old man's voice ): Where'd you get that ugly Injun? Why did they not gag that meshugena? ( female voice ): Behind you! Varmints.
LEADMALE:Look! ( Spanish accent ): I don't have to show you no stinkin' varmints! ( yells in Spanish ) ( yelling ) ( yells ) Well, that shows them, Tonto.
LEADFEMALE:Onward.
LEADMALE:( old man voice ): Who was that masked man? He stole my teeth.
SUPMALE:I need them for the bullets.
OTHERMALE:Hi-ho, Silver! ( clip clopping ) Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
SUPMALE:Whoa, Big Fella.
LEADMALE:Whoa, Big Fella, there.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry about that, Big Fella.
LEADMALE:You should be TV star.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, too much pressure and you have to get up too early.
LEADMALE:Oh, everything going so wonderful for me.
LEADMALE:I have new friend, place to live Uh, Sergei, I have to talk to you about that.
LEADMALE:You see, Mindy says we only have room enough for two and we have to find you a place of your own.
LEADMALE:My own? You mean I can live alone if I want to? Sure, why not? Well, where I come from, no one lives alone.
LEADFEMALE:Sharing a room with 60 people is solitary confinement.
LEADFEMALE:Must be a long line for the shower.
SUPMALE:Shower.
SUPMALE:Oh, so many things to learn.
SUPMALE:So many new experiences for me disco dancing, dirt bikes, uh, burritos, registering as an alien You have to register as an alien? Oh, all aliens must do so by January.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know there were that many of us.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, is thousands, maybe millions.
LEADFEMALE:Whew, then it's no big deal being an alien.
SUPMALE:Is big deal if you don't register.
OTHERMALE:It is the law, you must.
LEADMALE:Wonder why Mindy didn't tell me that.
LEADMALE:Is she alien? No, Caucasian.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then she wouldn't know.
OTHERMALE:It is big law, you must do this.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think they'll kick me off the planet? Oh, I don't know if they would go that far.
LEADMALE:But they could arrest you.
LEADMALE:I'm not supposed to get in trouble.
LEADMALE:Orson'll be really T.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:'d.
LEADFEMALE:I saw two men get picked up by the immigration authorities.
LEADFEMALE:They were aliens without proper identification.
SUPFEMALE:Where do I get proper identification? Immigration Bureau.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I better go to the ( imitates Sergei ): Immigration Bureau.
LEADMALE:I'll leave Mindy a note.
SUPFEMALE:Do you know where it is? No, I haven't written it yet.
SUPMALE:( honking bark ) ( barks back ) ( honking barking ) Are these people all aliens? Well, they must be they're here.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, are you from Romny Five? Ah.
LEADFEMALE:No second nose I guess not.
SUPMALE:Next.
LEADMALE:I'm here to register.
SUPFEMALE:I'm an alien.
SUPFEMALE:Fill this out and bring it back to me.
OTHERFEMALE:No sweat.
SUPMALE:Nanu-nanu.
SUPMALE:Sergei, psst.
OTHERFEMALE:It didn't even phase him when I told him I was an alien.
LEADMALE:Oh, he sees hundreds of aliens every week.
SUPMALE:Wait'll Orson hears about this.
SUPMALE:Whoa, check this out.
OTHERFEMALE:The ten most popular people.
LEADFEMALE:Real nimnulls.
SUPFEMALE:Those are criminals! Criminals, nimnulls, they don't look too swift to me.
SUPMALE:Whoa, this pen's on a leash.
OTHERFEMALE:What's wrong? Did you write a bad check? ( honking bark ) Let's see, name: Mork.
LEADMALE:Easy.
OTHERMALE:One down.
LEADFEMALE:Place of residence: Ork.
SUPFEMALE:Two down.
LEADFEMALE:Education: P.
OTHERFEMALE:S.
SUPFEMALE:one million six.
LEADMALE:Graduation date: Betty Lou Zombax.
OTHERFEMALE:Residence: Mindy's house.
LEADFEMALE:( honking bark ) And, let's see, occupation: observing your primitive planet and reporting back its customs to Orson.
SUPFEMALE:( whistles ) Oh! Hey I can't answer this one.
LEADMALE:What should I do? Oh, take these to that nice clerk over there.
LEADMALE:Kay-o.
LEADMALE:Now what do you want? Oh, he told me to take it to the nice clerk, but since she's busy, I'll talk to you.
SUPFEMALE:If I can't answer this question, do I fail the exam? This is an informational form.
LEADMALE:Even you couldn't fail it.
OTHERMALE:Whew! Well, which question is it? That one.
LEADMALE:"Have you had a recent vaccination?" No, but I'd like to go to Miami Beach and stay at the Fontainebleau.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Vaccination.
LEADFEMALE:Like when they stick you with a needle.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I get the point.
SUPMALE:( honking bark ) Where did you come from? Over there.
SUPMALE:Okay, let's start from the beginning.
LEADFEMALE:Where's your passport? I give up, where? Don't you have a passport? No.
SUPMALE:What's a passport? Don't you have any identification? Well, I have a mole right here.
SUPMALE:How's that identification? I don't think anyone else has one right here.
SUPFEMALE:This is ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:I can show you the one on my right hip.
LEADMALE:No, that won't be necessary! Now now, let me get this straight.
SUPMALE:You don't have a green card.
SUPFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:No passport.
LEADMALE:Ditto.
SUPFEMALE:No visa.
LEADMALE:Right on.
OTHERFEMALE:No birth certificate? Not even a note from home.
SUPMALE:Legally you don't exist.
LEADMALE:Oh, you exaggerate.
OTHERFEMALE:Therefore, I am.
LEADMALE:Would you send the guard in here? You know, there are penalties for being an illegal alien.
LEADMALE:Hey, I resent that! Even though my father was an eye dropper, he married Mom.
LEADMALE:He had to.
LEADFEMALE:Bob, I think we'd better hang on to this guy and ask him a few questions.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go home.
LEADFEMALE:CLERK: Miss, miss, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid we're going to have to detain your friend.
LEADFEMALE:I got your note.
SUPFEMALE:What is going on? I have to register as an alien.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no You don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, you don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:I could be in big trouble.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Uh, now, what seems to be the problem here? He's an alien; he doesn't have any identification.
LEADMALE:We've got to ask him a few questions.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he's not an alien.
LEADMALE:Um, can I suggest a question? Please.
SUPMALE:Ask him where he's from.
SUPMALE:Oh, from the planet Ork.
LEADFEMALE:You see, it's in the photosphere of the galaxy Mellow Catorius, near the black hole Leon.
LEADFEMALE:Oh I see.
SUPMALE:( chuckles ) And, uh, how did you get here? Boat? Plane? Flying egg.
SUPFEMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:I always go by flying bacon myself.
LEADMALE:Oh, the express The Sizzler.
LEADMALE:Now tell him how you drink.
SUPMALE:Oh, don't be a clone.
LEADFEMALE:You know that.
LEADMALE:Well With my finger.
LEADFEMALE:Pfft! Eeh! Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Guard, would you please escort this gentleman out to his, uh, flying egg? Uh, would you put that desk back where it was? No moisture.
SUPFEMALE:( high-pitched tone ) ( tone continues ) Oh, this America is country on move.
LEADMALE:( laughs ): I tell you.
SUPMALE:We're going.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, all these people are aliens.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:Sergei, we're leaving! Hello! Hello.
SUPMALE:Nanu-nanu.
SUPFEMALE:( whimpering groan ) I don't get it.
SUPFEMALE:What? Why did Sergei call himself an alien if he'd never even been to the moon? We call people who come here from other countries "aliens.
LEADFEMALE:" Oh, that's strange.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone on Ork calls himself an Orkan.
OTHERFEMALE:You humans subdivide yourself into different species Russians, Americans, Protestants, Jews, game show hosts.
OTHERMALE:( laughs ) We do.
SUPFEMALE:I'm afraid that we haven't learned to live together very well yet.
LEADMALE:Another thing I feel strange about is democracy.
LEADMALE:Why? Well, after Sergei got his apartment, he went out to get a driver's license, and because he was an alien, it took all day.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I think you're getting democracy mixed up with bureaucracy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, semantic confusion or rented lips.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ) You see, democracy is the "one man, one vote" system, and bureaucracy is the most difficult way to get anything done.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you have such an inefficient system? Well, we've been working hard at it.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, we've been trying to streamline things, but that could take years.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Bureaucracy.
LEADMALE:( knocking ) ( speaks Russian ) Hi! Hey-hey! What's happening, Mork? Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
SUPMALE:You look awfully chipper.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yes, I am happy because of this great democracy.
LEADFEMALE:Have place to live, have driver's license.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't it take you all day to get it? Oh, yes, that's what's so great about it.
SUPMALE:Because where I come from, it would take six months.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? Oh, yes, and if I failed, they make me date female Russian shot-putter.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, Mork and I are really happy you're adjusting to everything so well.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, very much thank you.
LEADMALE:I must leave now, but before I go, I-I want you to have something from me.
LEADFEMALE:This is some Russian caviar.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, thanks, Sergei.
SUPFEMALE:I'm really sorry you can't stay for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, I have to go back and check out my new dynamite pad.
LEADMALE:( chuckles ) Dosvidanya, Tovarich.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:I don't understand it.
SUPMALE:Democracy didn't work with three people, it didn't work with two people, but it works for Sergei, and he lives all alone.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's one of the good things about democracy.
LEADMALE:It protects the individual.
SUPFEMALE:And speaking of protection, I think next time you have any questions, you should ask me first.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a real nimnull.
LEADFEMALE:You ask me to take a poll, and I brought home a Russian.
LEADFEMALE:( honking bark ) Whew! That's caviar.
SUPMALE:Fish eggs.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Return to mother ship! Yeah, back on home.
LEADFEMALE:Roe, roe, roe, roe, roe, roe.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you like it? ( deep voice ): No way.
LEADMALE:Mork, calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:( singing in Russian ) ( Russian accent ): Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, comrade.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! ORSON: That accent.
LEADFEMALE:It's Russian.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, I'll slow it down.
LEADFEMALE:( slow motion ): Mork calling Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Come in, comrade.
SUPMALE:Heyyy! Just the report, Mork.
LEADMALE:Sorry, Your Rotundity.
LEADFEMALE:What's happening inside your head? Is your brain flaky? Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:This is what earthlings call snow.
LEADMALE:Uh, it's kind of like Martian lint bombs, only frozen.
LEADFEMALE:Are they dangerous? Oh, no.
OTHERMALE:If you try and light their fuse, they turn to water.
LEADMALE:What else have you observed? Well, earthlings have a custom called "voting.
SUPFEMALE:" It's so everyone can have a voice in democracy.
SUPMALE:And they all vote? No, only about half of them.
SUPMALE:The rest have political laryngitis.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe they just don't like their leaders.
SUPMALE:I think that's part of the problem.
LEADMALE:Too bad they don't have someone as well-rounded as you.
SUPFEMALE:Is that another fat joke, Mork? Oh, no, Your Obesity.
LEADMALE:I mean, we're lucky enough that we have someone like you that we can all stand behind.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, all of us, the entire planet.
SUPFEMALE:That was a cheap shot, Mork.
OTHERMALE:Oh, rejection.
LEADFEMALE:Heavy thigh.
SUPMALE:( chuckles ): I mean, sigh.
LEADMALE:See you next week, Your Acreage.
SUPMALE:Nanu-nanu.
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! Able to leap over tall buildings? Hah! Anybody can do that in zero gravity.
SUPFEMALE:What's the big deal about that? They call him Superman for that? Oh, I'm perturbed.
OTHERFEMALE:I've got to write a letter about this.
OTHERFEMALE:Miss Smith, take some dictation.
LEADFEMALE:( in woman's voice ): No way! All right, I'll do it myself.
LEADMALE:Dear Superman.
LEADFEMALE:Ding.
LEADMALE:I am writing you this letter because I'm really perturbed.
SUPMALE:Ding.
LEADMALE:How can you call yourself a man of steel if you wear blue tights with the underwear on the outside? Ding.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone knows that Krypton is the Miami Beach of the Universe.
SUPFEMALE:Ding.
LEADMALE:You're a jive turkey in red booties.
LEADFEMALE:Ding.
LEADFEMALE:Love, your friend, Mork from Ork.
LEADMALE:Ding.
LEADFEMALE:PS, Don't you sweat a lot, wearing two suits? Ding.
OTHERFEMALE:Good morning.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, God bless you.
OTHERMALE:Do you know where I can get a stamp? Oh, sure, I think there's some over there in the drawer.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, good.
SUPMALE:Where are you sending a letter? Metropolis.
OTHERMALE:Well, I have to go to work early this morning, 'cause Grandma's not feeling well.
LEADFEMALE:( beeps ) Shazbot! ( loud banging ) Whoa! The mice must be taking steroids.
LEADFEMALE:It's that Bickley creep again.
LEADFEMALE:You mean that nice man that moved in downstairs? Nice?! ( banging ) Haven't you met him yet? No, I've been too busy reading these alien newsletters.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that Bickley character has been making my life miserable.
LEADFEMALE:While you're safe up in your attic, he's always pounding on his ceiling which happens to be attached to my floor.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, Mindy, one man's ceiling is another man's floor.
LEADFEMALE:That's some heavy apartment philosophy and you've got to remember that.
SUPFEMALE:And the worst part is, I'm not even a noisy person.
LEADMALE:( loud banging ) I can't stand it.
LEADMALE:Mindy, you earthlings must learn some more virtues, like being more tolerant.
LEADMALE:We have a saying on Ork, "Tolerance is next to cowardice.
LEADFEMALE:" Don't Orkans ever have any problems with unreasonable neighbors? Well, one time the planet next to us blew up, we all complained about it, and they never did it again.
LEADMALE:Well, that's wonderful, but I don't think I can wait for his apartment to blow up.
SUPMALE:I've been down there three times already and it hasn't done any good.
LEADFEMALE:You just have to learn to adjust.
OTHERMALE:How can I adjust to constant pounding? Oh, make it fun.
LEADFEMALE:Watch this.
LEADMALE:( singing to tune of Stayin' Alive): I can tell by the way you hold your teeth You're an older man with a lot to bequeath Ah, ah I can tell by the way you take that pill You're about to sign your only will Ah, ah, ah, ah Barely alive, barely alive! Mork, I don't have happy feet, I have angry ears and that guy is really bugging me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh? Well, you'll just have to be a little more acoustically understanding.
OTHERMALE:Understanding?! Well, why don't you go talk to him and see how understanding you feel.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, I got to get to work.
SUPMALE:I'll see you later, okay? Ciao.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:( sighs ) ( door slams ) ( loud banging ) No, thanks! I'll sit this one out! I give it about a 65, though! It's got a good beat, but a little hard to dance to! ( loud knocking ) Quiet up there! MORK: I'm not a ventriloquist.
LEADFEMALE:I'm out here.
LEADMALE:Oh, interruptions, interruptions Who are you? Hello, I'm Mork.
LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, no.
SUPMALE:Get out of here.
SUPMALE:( loud knocking ) Oh, what is it, what is it? I'm still Mork.
LEADFEMALE:I'm from upstairs.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you.
LEADMALE:I've been wanting to talk to you, Bigfoot.
LEADMALE:You and your noisy girlfriend have been driving me out of my mind.
LEADFEMALE:What a coincidence.
LEADMALE:She says the same thing about you.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I'm trying to work down here.
LEADFEMALE:It's tough enough without you guys tromping around up there.
LEADFEMALE:I'd rather live under the Harlem Globetrotters.
LEADMALE:Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy.
LEADMALE:What are these? Those are greeting cards.
OTHERFEMALE:I design and illustrate greeting cards.
LEADFEMALE:What are greeting cards? A gold mine, that's what they are.
SUPMALE:Every simple-minded idiot whose mother has a birthday can't think what to blow his last sixty cents on.
LEADMALE:Eh, thanks to me, he can now send a simple, stupid, sappy card, filled with phony sentiment.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that sounds fantastic! Read me one.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you probably would like this drivel.
OTHERMALE:"To my mother.
SUPMALE:" Ew.
LEADMALE:"Your smile to me is like the dawn" Oh, gee "Whose coming hides the darkness "and lifts the sorrow from my aching heart.
OTHERMALE:"If only I could tell you, Mother, "what your life has meant to mine, "then I could die a happy man, although it means we part.
LEADFEMALE:" ( sobbing ) That's beautiful.
SUPFEMALE:Garbage.
LEADFEMALE:How can you say that about your own poetry? Hey, it pays the bills.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have to like it.
LEADMALE:Oh, look.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at the pretty bunnies.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:A hunter I know lets me draw his rabbits before he skins them.
LEADFEMALE:Here's another one.
LEADMALE:"What is a friend?" Oh, brother "A person who is kind and just, "A person full of love and trust, "Who knows your faults but doesn't give a flying care Who, when you call, is always there.
LEADFEMALE:" Yeah, I know, I know.
SUPMALE:"A person who will e'er be true "A person who is just like you.
LEADFEMALE:" ( sobbing ) Swill.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's not only swell, it's fantastic.
LEADMALE:Read me another one, please.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, but yet you are.
SUPMALE:See how considerate you're being? I'm not being considerate.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and you're modest too.
OTHERMALE:( loud thump ) Oh, no, it's those kids again.
SUPMALE:I can't get any work done.
OTHERMALE:Hey! Hey, kid! Yes, you! Now that was a terrific throw.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see you do it again.
LEADFEMALE:( sharp thud ) Oh-ho! Amazing! Do you think you can throw it to me? Ah Oh-ho! Scuzzy little yard monkey! I really ought to take these down to the orphanage and sell them.
SUPMALE:You wonderful guy, you.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? I know what you're trying to do.
LEADMALE:You're trying to hide it underneath that crust, but I know, deep down inside, you're trying to save that young kid's life.
SUPFEMALE:If he had taken this ball, he might have thrown it out in the street, then a truck would have come along and hit him, then he'd be in the hospital, and all of his little friends would have to send him get-well cards, and Oh, no, you're more than a wonderful guy, you're a saint! You gave up your own business just to save that little kid's life.
SUPMALE:Hey, kid! Here's your ball! My life has been miserable ever since he moved in.
OTHERMALE:Boy, that guy sounds like a real jerk.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he's worse than that.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know how I can go on living there.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet he'd pound if I dropped a hint.
LEADFEMALE:You know, your mother and I moved into this apartment once, and there was somebody next door who was pounding on the walls for two days straight.
LEADMALE:Well, finally, I had enough of it and I went next door to tell him off.
SUPMALE:Well, did you? Nah, I couldn't.
LEADMALE:It was a guy in traction and his nurse had died.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Dad! That did make my day.
LEADMALE:You want me to go over and talk to him? No, I can do it.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that I get so mad every time it happens.
LEADMALE:Mm, well, you see, that's just it, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Sometimes you have to learn how to handle these things without getting mad.
LEADMALE:Mm, that's what Mork says.
LEADFEMALE:In that case, maybe I'm wrong.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, babe? Yeah? You the chick that sold me this album last week? Well, we sell that album.
LEADMALE:Do you have a receipt? You didn't give me a receipt.
SUPMALE:I always staple the receipt to the bag.
SUPFEMALE:You didn't give me a bag, honey.
LEADMALE:Well, what were you gonna do, listen to it on the way home? I'll handle this.
LEADMALE:Uh, what seems to be the problem? This chick you got working for you is trying to rip me off.
LEADMALE:I got no bag, I got no receipt, and I got a defective album.
LEADMALE:What's wrong with it? I don't like it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you can't return an album just because you don't like it.
SUPMALE:Well, I wouldn't return it if I did like it.
SUPMALE:You know, I don't like your attitude.
LEADMALE:Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy tolerance.
LEADMALE:What seems to be the energy problem here? I got a defective album.
OTHERMALE:It's, uh, it's scratched.
LEADMALE:Well, let's try and deal with this in a holistic way.
SUPFEMALE:Don't itch it and let it achieve its own energy and heal itself.
LEADMALE:I don't like your attitude.
LEADFEMALE:That's because you haven't got to know my essence yet.
SUPFEMALE:Tell you what.
SUPFEMALE:We'll get together, we'll have cocktails, and work out our karma together.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to have cocktails with your karma.
LEADMALE:Well, we'll get together and have a natural breakfast, lunch or dinner.
LEADMALE:You know, I feel an incredible vibration from you.
LEADMALE:Let's share it.
SUPMALE:Come on, now, don't be afraid.
LEADFEMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:You're an Aries, right? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Fantastic! I knew it! I see an incredible potential in you.
LEADFEMALE:You know, there's an amazing being in all the universe that can be and you know what? I see a potential for you in show business.
LEADFEMALE:I play guitar! Fantastic! Wow, psychic! I knew it.
LEADFEMALE:Have your service call my service, and be here now if not, get there later.
SUPMALE:Ciao! Well, I have to admit that was really impressive.
OTHERMALE:Well, you just have to use kindness, that's how I overcame Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley.
SUPMALE:You went down to see Bickley today? Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:We're the best of friends now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on! Oh, yeah! He said stop by again real soon.
SUPFEMALE:By the way, when does hell freeze over? Best of friends.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:But Mindy, you have to be real considerate of him, he's getting a little old and you know, losing a little bit, because he must have asked me ten or 12 times if I wanted to take a hike.
OTHERMALE:Well, did you ever get around to talking about the noise problem? No, no, mainly we just talked about you.
LEADMALE:He must have been a repairman at some time or another, because he keeps wanting to fix your wagon.
SUPMALE:I bet he would, too.
SUPMALE:Well, he's not going to get the chance.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, he will.
OTHERMALE:I invited him over for dinner, tonight at 8:00.
LEADFEMALE:And I feel the energy's right, so I'll catch you there.
SUPFEMALE:The gestalt is now.
LEADFEMALE:All right, let's see.
LEADMALE:We'll bus you into this neighborhood.
SUPMALE:We'll put up a tenement here.
LEADFEMALE:That should shock 'em.
SUPMALE:All right, we'll move Lester Maddox off the board.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good! By the end of the game, we should have the whole place integrated.
SUPMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Playing Supreme Court.
LEADFEMALE:Well, not to change the subject, but I wish you would check with me before you go inviting anyone over here.
LEADMALE:Oh, you mean like Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Bickley? Yeah, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley.
OTHERMALE:And Susan Taylor, and that Russian guy, Sergei.
SUPMALE:Well, Mindy, there's an old Orkan saying that applies to this.
LEADFEMALE:You see, if someone pounds on your ceiling because they don't like the noise you're making, invite them over for dinner.
SUPMALE:What a wonderful saying.
SUPMALE:Look, Mork, I don't want Bickley in my apartment.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, see, there's an incredible energy right there, because he doesn't want to be in your apartment, either.
SUPMALE:And you talked him into it? Well, it wasn't very hard.
LEADFEMALE:I told him you'd fix him a nice dinner, then we'd all get together, we'd talk for Wait a minute! I'll fix him dinner?! Wow, dÃ©jÃ  vu.
SUPMALE:Uh-uh, you got that one wrong.
LEADFEMALE:You invited him over, so you fix him dinner.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I get it.
LEADMALE:I'll make my bed, so I've got to hang from it.
OTHERMALE:You got it.
OTHERFEMALE:But I don't even know how to cook.
LEADMALE:I've never even met Julia Childs.
LEADMALE:Well, Mork, there's an old saying on Earth: Fake it.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Impending culinary doom.
LEADFEMALE:So, what are we having for dinner tonight? Check.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha! Check? We haven't even eaten.
LEADMALE:Just a little off the side top ( pounding at door ) Come in, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley! How did you know it was me? I'd know your pounding anywhere.
LEADMALE:I brought you two a gift a bottle of bourbon.
OTHERMALE:Oh, how nice.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay.
LEADFEMALE:I always swipe a couple of these when I fly.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look, little munchkin bourbon.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'd like a drink.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sure, what'll you have? Bourbon.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, this is all we have.
SUPMALE:Well, you couldn't pickle a cricket in that.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm sorry, but we have nothing stronger than wine in the house.
SUPFEMALE:What about that 20-year-old scotch your father? Mork! Shh! That's for a special occasion.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it.
OTHERFEMALE:I hate Scotch.
LEADFEMALE:It's disgusting and putrid.
LEADMALE:Speaking of disgusting and putrid, my salad's burning.
LEADFEMALE:His salad is burning? Mork has a lot of exotic recipes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you kids sit down.
LEADMALE:We'll start off with the appetizers.
LEADFEMALE:We'll begin with a little Maalox au gratin.
SUPFEMALE:A little cheese for the three of us.
SUPFEMALE:A little fromage Ã  trois.
LEADMALE:( honking bark ) Maalox You can sit over there Maalox? Oh! All I have here are three knives! I have four.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, I forgot the soup forks.
OTHERFEMALE:Soup forks? Bonjour, Madame et Monsieur.
SUPFEMALE:Welcome to Chez Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Tonight's specialty was going to be the chicken in butter sauce, but that slippery sucker got away.
LEADFEMALE:Monsieur, would you like to see the wine list? Yes.
LEADMALE:LÃ -bas.
SUPFEMALE:For you, smell the cap.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, a very good week.
LEADMALE:Monsieur, with this wine and a doorway, you'll have a fantastic weekend.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, Monsieur, for you, the specialty of the day.
SUPMALE:There we are, lÃ -bas.
LEADFEMALE:( speaks nonsense French ) For you, here we are.
SUPFEMALE:Okay BICKLEY: What's this supposed to be? ( with accent ): Le peas frozen.
OTHERFEMALE:You said you're always asking for "peas and quiet.
LEADMALE:" ( laughs ) But seriously, nice to have you here.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll tell the chef you're here.
OTHERMALE:Yo, Al, we got people here! Start cooking, sucker! ( speaking rapid-fire gibberish ) These are delicious! What? They're not even cooked! Well, at least this way they don't lose any of their vitamins.
LEADFEMALE:I think maybe I will have some of that scotch.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, okay.
SUPMALE:That's a very good idea, Monsieur.
SUPMALE:You won't spoil your appetite that way.
LEADFEMALE:Now, for the secondary course for you ( speaking nonsense French ) Le poomph! What is what's this mess? Oh, en franÃ§ais, le soupe, en anglais, soup.
LEADMALE:Actually, it's a gestalt gumbo.
SUPMALE:You see the little tiny live shrimp? I couldn't bring myself to kill them once I looked in their eyes.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Monsieur.
OTHERMALE:Things aren't going too well.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get the busboy to clean up the excess.
SUPFEMALE:But first, a little entertainment for you.
LEADMALE:Carl Carl, quickly, come! Feelings Nothing more than I'm sorry, Monsieur.
LEADFEMALE:He's not worked since The Wizard of Oz.
LEADFEMALE:We had to give him a chance.
SUPMALE:Mm-mm! It's like a soup and sandwich, all in one.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I get it.
LEADMALE:You two are doing this so I'll leave.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, no.
LEADMALE:Mork is honestly trying to cook you a good dinner.
LEADFEMALE:But ( sings fanfare ) And now, Monsieur, for the spÃ©cialitÃ© de l'apartement le soufflÃ©! Whoa, cool it! It's ready now.
OTHERFEMALE:I need more scotch.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, are you sure you followed the recipe? Well, it called for beating eggs, and I couldn't bring myself to do that.
LEADFEMALE:That settles it.
LEADFEMALE:I can't take any more of this.
LEADMALE:But you haven't taken any of it.
LEADMALE:Let's just say I'm not hungry right now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's all right, we'll put it in a doggy bag.
OTHERMALE:But for you, a grouch pouch.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley, this is the first time Mork has ever cooked.
SUPFEMALE:Really? I never would have guessed.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Mork's dinner wasn't great, but at least he tried.
SUPMALE:He shouldn't have.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you should be more tolerant of people.
LEADFEMALE:Now, we've had to put up with a lot from you lately.
LEADFEMALE:Like what? Like what?! Like your constant pounding and your rudeness.
SUPMALE:You have been making my life miserable.
SUPFEMALE:I just complain a little.
LEADFEMALE:It's not that bad.
LEADMALE:It's terrible! Do you know that you're the worst neighbor I've ever had? Isn't it wonderful? You're the top of your field.
SUPFEMALE:Really? I'm that bad? Well, let's just say if the Marquis de Sade were still alive, you'd come in a close second.
LEADMALE:But, here's your consolation prize your snack sack.
OTHERFEMALE:If I'm so unlikable, why are you always nice to me? Well, I believe the meaner a person is, the nicer you should be.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I'm treating you like an emperor.
OTHERMALE:It's easy for you to be nice.
LEADMALE:You've got each other.
LEADFEMALE:I hear you laughing up here, and I'm down there all alone.
OTHERMALE:Well, if you treated people with a little kindness and respect, I'm sure you'd have lots of friends.
LEADFEMALE:Be reasonable, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Not lots; a few, maybe.
LEADMALE:I don't mind not having friends.
LEADFEMALE:I just wish I had someone to come home to.
SUPMALE:You know, someone who needed me.
LEADFEMALE:Someone who cared for me.
LEADFEMALE:Someone Aw, I better say good night.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm beginning to sound like one of my own greeting cards.
OTHERFEMALE:There goes one sad earthling.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, that's for sure.
LEADMALE:What can we do to help? I don't think there's anything we can do.
LEADFEMALE:People just don't want to be around that man.
LEADMALE:We can hire someone.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:It doesn't work like that, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:There's an there's an old Earth saying that, "There's one thing money can't buy, it's love.
LEADFEMALE:" By the way, thanks for the dinner.
LEADMALE:It stunk.
SUPMALE:( knocking ) Oh interruptions, interruptions.
LEADFEMALE:Who is it? Mindy McConnell from upstairs.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, what do you want? Hi.
LEADMALE:Can I come in? That depends.
LEADMALE:You intend talking to me? Well, yeah In that case, no.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley, are you are you embarrassed about last night? Why should I be embarrassed? You're the one who tried to poison me.
SUPMALE:You know what I'm talking about.
LEADFEMALE:The things that you said about being lonely.
SUPFEMALE:You believe that junk? I always talk that way after a couple of scotches.
LEADFEMALE:As a matter of fact, I did believe it, and that's why I baked you this cake.
SUPFEMALE:I want us to be friends.
LEADMALE:There's icing on it.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
OTHERMALE:I hate cake with icing.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know why I hate winter in Colorado? The Rockies look like they're covered with icing.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley, how can you possibly stand here and? ( knocking ) Aw, probably some kids trying to sell me cookies with icing on them.
LEADFEMALE:Hiya, Bickey.
OTHERMALE:That's Bickley! Oh, that's my friendly nickname for you.
LEADMALE:Oh, why me? Mork, where have you been all morning? Out to disprove an old Earth saying.
SUPMALE:Look.
SUPMALE:( gasps ) I sprung him from an animal jail.
LEADFEMALE:He was in for assaulting a fire hydrant.
OTHERMALE:Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:Now I'll have to listen to howling and barking all the time.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, you won't, because he sings and dances.
SUPFEMALE:Watch this.
SUPMALE:Camptown races, sing this song, doo-dah, doo-dah! And he al and he also sings the blues.
SUPMALE:Georgia, Georgia He's for you because I don't want you to be lonely anymore.
LEADFEMALE:You mean why, that's that's the nicest thing anybody ever did for me.
LEADMALE:( sobbing ): Buying me a stupid dog.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mork! That was a wonderful thing you did.
LEADMALE:What did you mean about disproving an old Earth saying? Well, that money can buy love.
LEADMALE:Even if it's only puppy love.
SUPFEMALE:I'll call him Bickey.
OTHERMALE:Sing, damn you.
SUPFEMALE:Sing You can do it.
LEADFEMALE:Camptown races, sing this song Pick up the beat.
LEADFEMALE:Sing! Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Laser Breath.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:ORSON: What are you doing, Mork? Acting superhero-ish.
SUPFEMALE:Funny, you don't look superhero-ish.
LEADMALE:Let's hear your report.
LEADFEMALE:Did you meet any interesting earthlings this week? Well, this week, I met an earthling who makes greeting cards.
LEADMALE:Those are what humans send to people who are sick.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't they just send a doctor, like we do on Ork? Oh, no, sir.
LEADFEMALE:You see, doctors are worshipped here.
SUPMALE:They don't come to see you.
SUPFEMALE:You go to see them.
OTHERMALE:And they also live in luxury hotels called hospitals.
SUPMALE:These hospitals are so overcrowded, the humans have devised a strange and unusual custom of gaining admittance.
LEADFEMALE:Like what? One's called "skiing.
SUPMALE:" They climb to the top of a huge mountain of sky flakes.
LEADMALE:When they get there, they strap two pieces of wood to their feet, and then they slide down.
LEADMALE:And if they're lucky, they hit a tree, and they gain admittance to a hospital.
LEADMALE:That sounds like a lot of work.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:You should see how they gain admittance to a mortuary.
LEADMALE:Well, see you next week.
SUPMALE:Ten-four, huge buddy.
LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
OTHERMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! ( theme song playing ) Oh, I love a good wedding.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's always such a happy occasion.
LEADFEMALE:Not for that poor sucker in the white dress.
LEADFEMALE:You mean the bride? I couldn't tell.
LEADFEMALE:They had that net over her head.
LEADFEMALE:What a really vicious tribal custom, you know? I knew they had it in for her when she tried to make her getaway down the aisle, and they had that midget holding her back by the dress.
SUPFEMALE:And I knew it was really over for her when that guy dragged her out front to meet that vicious mob.
LEADMALE:What vicious mob? Well, the one that was pelting her with little white pebbles.
OTHERMALE:No wonder married women get so many headaches.
LEADMALE:Mork, those people weren't throwing little white pebbles.
SUPMALE:They were throwing rice, and it's what earthlings do to wish the newly married couple good luck.
LEADMALE:It wasn't good luck for those people whose feet they stole and tied to the back of that car.
LEADFEMALE:Those were old shoes, and they symbolize the hope for prosperity.
SUPFEMALE:Just like the cans that are tied on the back.
LEADMALE:They tie their cans back there, too? ( knock at door ) Well, it's kind of late for somebody to drop by.
LEADMALE:Will you see who it is? Who is it? Eugene.
OTHERMALE:It's Eugene.
LEADMALE:You know, you really amaze me.
SUPFEMALE:And myself, too.
OTHERMALE:Eugene, what are you doing here so late? I'm running away from home.
LEADFEMALE:Your home's chasing you? It must be a mobile home.
LEADMALE:Well, why are you running away? Because of my mother.
LEADMALE:She acts like she owns me.
LEADMALE:I'll give you some money.
OTHERFEMALE:You can make a down payment and buy yourself back.
SUPFEMALE:Mothers don't care about money.
LEADMALE:All they care about is power.
LEADFEMALE:( imitating woman ): Hang up your clothes.
LEADMALE:Eat your vegetables.
LEADMALE:Brush your teeth.
SUPFEMALE:Take a bath.
LEADFEMALE:I always thought mothers were nice people, too.
LEADMALE:Not mine.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, I just wanted to say good-bye.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna miss you, my main munchkin.
LEADFEMALE:There's some tears gonna well up in my eyes.
SUPFEMALE:I feel a severe moisture right now.
SUPMALE:MINDY: Eugene, do you really think that running away is the answer? I just can't stand anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Tonight she yelled at me for spitting out my liver.
LEADFEMALE:Spitting out your liver that could kill you! Eugene, those organs were put there for a purpose.
LEADFEMALE:It was calves' liver.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Dopey me.
LEADFEMALE:Then there's the milk hassle.
OTHERFEMALE:She makes me finish every last drop.
LEADMALE:Well, that's because milk is good for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, but it's still hard to drink once you know where it comes from.
LEADMALE:Eugene, in a couple of days, you're gonna look back on this whole thing, and you're gonna laugh about it.
LEADMALE:No way.
LEADMALE:This has been building up since I was three.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe longer.
OTHERMALE:I can't remember before that.
SUPFEMALE:She didn't even like my Mother's Day present, and I saved a long time to buy that snake.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't realize children were so persecuted.
LEADFEMALE:EUGENE: Well, so long, Mork.
LEADMALE:What it was, Plasma.
LEADMALE:Mindy.
LEADMALE:Eugene, I hate to tell you, but as bad as you think you have it at home, you're no worse off than any other kids your age.
SUPFEMALE:Now look, I happen to know your mother, and I know that she's a nice, sweet and fair person.
LEADFEMALE:So, she got to you, didn't she? Look, and your parents are probably worried to death by now, so I'm gonna take you home for your own good.
LEADMALE:Why doesn't anyone take me to Disneyland for my own good? Come on.
LEADMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:You're not gonna take him back to that tyrant! I grant him parental asylum.
LEADMALE:( both chanting ): Hell, no, we won't go! Hell, no, we won't go! Hell, no Come on.
LEADMALE:Come on, you guys, what is the worst thing could happen? She could strap me to my chair and make me eat broccoli.
LEADMALE:Broccoli! Aah! Broccoli's despised throughout the universe.
LEADMALE:( laughs ) When was the last time you ate broccoli? Well, when I was three bleams old.
LEADMALE:And I still haven't swallowed it.
LEADMALE:So, Eugene's parents weren't upset? MINDY: Not at all.
LEADFEMALE:They had a feeling that he was with us.
SUPMALE:He left a note saying to forward his allowance to my house.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Kids do some crazy things sometimes.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, yeah, well, that hardly comes as a shock to the father of an ex-four-year-old who once tried to defect.
OTHERMALE:I? No.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, yes.
LEADFEMALE:You got very mad at me one day when I hollered at you for drying the dishes with the cat.
LEADFEMALE:Then you went up to your room, and you got your pillow and your teddy bear and your pinecone collection.
LEADFEMALE:You announced you were running away from home.
SUPMALE:Where did I go? Uh, nowhere.
OTHERMALE:There were no volunteers when you asked who was gonna drive you.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy.
LEADMALE:MINDY: Hi.
LEADMALE:Carbonation.
LEADMALE:Carbonation? Well, you told me never to call you Pops again.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you're a gas.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:So, what have you been doing this morning? Well, I was making observations of your primitive planet.
LEADMALE:You know, I'm really impressed with how your police deal with tension here by throwing parties for their citizens.
LEADFEMALE:I saw this one policeman who had stopped a guy and was teaching him how to dance by touching his nose and going, "Come on, now, can you do it?" When he did that, well, they gave him a present and gave him a chance to blow up a balloon, then he gave him a massage and gave him a free ride in his car.
LEADFEMALE:I was so impressed, I jumped out of the crowd that was watching and said, "Police hospitality! Police hospitality!" Well, that's it for today, dear.
OTHERFEMALE:For a first lesson, you did very well, Holly.
OTHERFEMALE:Before long, you and the piano will be the best of friends.
LEADMALE:I'm not ready for that kind of relationship, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Hudson.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll go in back and pick out some practice books for you if you'll wait here.
LEADMALE:I'm young.
LEADFEMALE:I have time.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Donny Osmond.
SUPMALE:All right, I'll tell the truth.
SUPFEMALE:My name is Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:Are you a stranger? Well, depends on where I am, actually.
LEADFEMALE:Then I'm not supposed to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:It's for my own good.
LEADFEMALE:Holly, I think you can talk to Mork.
SUPMALE:He's a good friend of Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Hudson's and mine.
LEADMALE:He's okay.
LEADFEMALE:So, what brings you here, little cherub? Well, my mother said I should take piano lessons because I'd be glad to know how to play when I was 20.
LEADFEMALE:So, how'd your lesson go? I'd better not die when I'm 19.
LEADMALE:( high-pitched beeping ) Hostility rating: 104.
LEADMALE:9.
LEADMALE:Are you angry at your mother, too? Let's just say, she owes me.
SUPMALE:Come along, Holly, dear, and I'll show you what I want you to practice.
LEADFEMALE:What a cute little girl.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, she's lucky.
LEADFEMALE:I never got to practice piano when I was a kid.
LEADMALE:They could never fit it in the test tube.
LEADMALE:Oh Eugene! What's action, fraction? Let it slide, Clyde.
LEADMALE:Get down, now, get back up again.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Oh, I guess you're not buying that honky jive today, eh? What's wrong? Trouble at home? You still have broccoli written all over your face.
OTHERMALE:You know, my cousin's really lucky.
SUPFEMALE:He's married and doesn't have to get washed every night.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, marriage is the only way to go.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, who's that? MORK: Well, that's Holly.
LEADFEMALE:Her mother's down on her, too.
SUPMALE:EUGENE: Sure is a doll.
LEADMALE:An android, maybe, but not a doll.
SUPMALE:No, that's not what I meant.
LEADMALE:A cute chick, a fox, you know? Oh! Real hot stuff! Oh, a fox.
SUPFEMALE:( low barking ) Okay, Eugene, it's time for your lesson.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you doing that? Oh, Eugene said you're hot stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, you're only 98.
SUPMALE:4.
SUPFEMALE:Mork! Did you really say that? Uh, not to the best of my recollection.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, plasma, you're stonewalling now.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, he said that.
LEADMALE:He called you more than that.
LEADFEMALE:He said you were a fox, a doll and cute poultry.
SUPMALE:You're weird! Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:The Princess almost decked you.
LEADMALE:Why did she do that? I think she likes me.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you'd better be careful she doesn't like you too much.
OTHERMALE:You'll be carrying your teeth around in a bag.
LEADMALE:Mindy, you can do it! Fly! It's all right! I know you can! Newton was wrong.
LEADMALE:Do it like Tinkerbell does Go for it, girl, go for it! What are you what are you doing? I was just trying to help you lift off.
LEADMALE:What you have to really do is shave your head to reduce the friction.
OTHERMALE:Come on! Let's try it again.
LEADMALE:There we go! Put me down! Oh, there's no place like home.
LEADMALE:Mork, I wasn't trying to fly.
LEADMALE:I'm late for a luncheon, and I've got to meet Sally, and I'm trying to dry my nails.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's easy.
LEADMALE:Here, let me show you.
LEADMALE:Just have to wipe them off like this.
SUPMALE:This wipes this stuff right off there.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Well, what are friends for? Whoa.
SUPMALE:You know, Mindy, you've got to wash your hands a little bit more often.
LEADMALE:Mindy, there's one thing I don't understand.
LEADMALE:Boy, you could've fooled me.
LEADMALE:Well, Eugene told me he liked Holly, but he didn't tell her.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you see, Mork, some people are shy.
LEADMALE:They might like someone, but oftentimes they can't express their feelings because they're afraid the other person might not like them.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Then why did Eugene think Holly liked him when she punched him and told him he was weird? Oh, well, boys and girls often punch or push or hit each other as a way of getting close.
LEADFEMALE:Punching and hitting and calling someone names means you like them? Yeah, it can.
LEADMALE:Then the Rams and the Cowboys are lovers? ( doorbell rings ) I'll get that.
SUPMALE:Might be Avon.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, I got to talk to you.
LEADMALE:What's wrong, Jackson? Can we be alone? That's impossible.
SUPMALE:There're two of us.
SUPMALE:I just don't want M-I-D-N-Y to hear.
LEADFEMALE:Well, listen, good old Midny can take a hint.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, if your conversation's so private, why don't you have it up in the attic? That's really appreciative of you.
OTHERMALE:Have a good night, Bird Legs.
LEADFEMALE:Bird Legs? I'm really into affection.
SUPMALE:See you later, burro breath.
LEADFEMALE:So, this is your pad? No, no, this is my room.
LEADMALE:This is my pad over here.
OTHERMALE:Look at this.
SUPFEMALE:It's really amazing, too.
LEADMALE:If you move it real fast, it looks like blank pages.
OTHERMALE:I don't know how you keep it so neat.
LEADMALE:Well, tidiness is my life.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'm ready.
LEADFEMALE:What is your question you want to ask me? I'm waiting with a worm on my tongue.
LEADMALE:What? Baited breath.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Mork, I think Holly and I are in love.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this sounds serious, plasma.
SUPFEMALE:We'd better sit down and analyze this.
LEADMALE:Beep.
SUPFEMALE:So, what are the early warning signals? Well, she called me piano mouth Piano mouth.
SUPMALE:Bozo brain Bozo brain.
OTHERFEMALE:And something I have only seen once on the bathroom wall.
OTHERFEMALE:Sounds like the real thing.
LEADFEMALE:We have so much in common.
LEADFEMALE:We both can't stand milk, liver, baths, broccoli and mothers.
SUPMALE:Her mom made her get rid of her pet goldfish.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sounds serious.
LEADMALE:Did she take it back to the store? They wouldn't take it.
OTHERMALE:It's been dead for a week.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:That's really a pity, because they're easier to train that way.
LEADFEMALE:Only if Holly and I could run away together, our problems would be solved.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you tried that once before, and it didn't work.
LEADMALE:I didn't go far enough.
SUPMALE:This time, I'd go on a ship, so the captain would marry us.
SUPMALE:And then our parents couldn't bug us anymore.
OTHERMALE:A captain of a ship can marry people? I saw it in a movie once.
SUPFEMALE:I see.
SUPFEMALE:I came here in a ship.
SUPMALE:I was the only person on that ship.
OTHERMALE:Ipso facto, then I'm a captain.
OTHERMALE:Hey, that's great! Would you marry Holly and me? Sure, no big deal! Come up here tomorrow afternoon after school, and it's yours.
OTHERFEMALE:Right on! Sam, blam, Sam, blam! By the way, you'd better not tell anyone we're getting married.
LEADMALE:Eugene, are you sure you're doing the right thing? I thought people here only get married when they want to have children.
LEADFEMALE:We don't need them, we are children.
LEADFEMALE:Makes sense, my man! Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, am I a dummy! Good-bye.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckling ): Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:What have you been doing all morning? Well, I was down at the library.
LEADMALE:Eugene said that was the place to go if you want to learn everything you want to know about weddings, and I was there all morning and no one got married, so I came back.
OTHERMALE:( laughing ): Oh.
SUPMALE:Why the sudden interest in weddings? Well, who knows? Maybe I'm the marrying kind.
LEADMALE:Irrepressible delight at ambiguous response.
LEADMALE:Did I hear you say that you would like to get married? Oh, no, I was just whacking around the bush.
SUPFEMALE:What I'd really like to know is more about weddings.
LEADFEMALE:Can you help me? Shoot.
LEADMALE:You don't need to swear.
OTHERMALE:Maybe I'll ask somebody else if you're really bummed out.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, I mean, what would you like to know? Well, first of all, the female who wears the net over her head, why does she wear white? Well, the bride wears white to symbolize her innocence and purity.
SUPMALE:Innocence and purity.
LEADMALE:Yes, and that explains why the groom wears black.
SUPFEMALE:Well, at the wedding I was at, there was a woman who sat in the front row and went, ( high voice ): "My baby! My baby! I'm losing my baby! She's leaving me!" ( normal voice ): Does she have an important job? Yes.
LEADMALE:That, uh, that's the bride's mother.
LEADMALE:MORK: Oh.
LEADFEMALE:The bride's mother has a very important job, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:She and her husband pay for the whole wedding.
SUPMALE:Oh, no wonder she was crying.
OTHERMALE:MINDY: No, actually, she helps out a lot before the wedding, too.
OTHERFEMALE:She helps the bride pick out her bride's dress and get a blood test and, and sometimes even pick out the license.
OTHERMALE:Mmm.
SUPMALE:About the only thing the mother doesn't do is give the bride a shower.
OTHERFEMALE:The bride's friends do that.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Let me see.
LEADFEMALE:You've given me a lot of information here.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see, first of all, they take a wedding test, then take license with each other, and finally they jump in the shower with the bride and hose her down.
LEADFEMALE:( imitating blow-dryer whirring ) ( whirring stops ) ( singing in Orkan ) Oh, go find Telly Savalas.
SUPFEMALE:( Mork muttering in Orkan ) ( imitating blow-dryer whirring ) What are you doing? Oh, I was just about to tease my hair.
OTHERFEMALE:Nyah-nyah, nyah-nyah Nyah-nyah-nyah nyah-nyah-nyah.
LEADFEMALE:Mork Mork, I just don't know if I'm ready to get married.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you can't go back now, plasma.
LEADMALE:Remember the calves' liver, the broccoli, the dead goldfish.
LEADMALE:Now, we've got to sit down and have a man- to-munchkin talk.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think there's a race problem? Oh, no, you can outrun her easy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, here are your wedding duds.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, but you didn't have to do that.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I'm a generous kind of guy.
LEADFEMALE:( doorbell rings ) Oh, here's your bride-to-be.
LEADMALE:You go get changed in the guest room, and I'll let you I'll let you know when the time's right.
LEADMALE:Inside here.
LEADMALE:Bam, bam, bam, blam, uh-uh.
LEADFEMALE:( doorbell ringing ) I'm coming! Ha-ha, Princess of the Munchkins! Are you ready to be joined in holy headlock? Anything's better than practicing piano.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy said first of all, you need to pass a blood test.
LEADMALE:Well I got a tooth pulled last week, and there was some blood.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you pass; let's go.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, here's your wedding kit.
LEADFEMALE:Inside is one genuine wedding gown designed by Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Mork of Boulder, Colorado.
LEADMALE:And also, what wedding is complete without a license? All right, Eugene is changing in the guest room.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, you go change in Mindy's room, and when you hear the music, come on up.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:By the way, have you had a shower today? No, but the dog licked my face.
SUPFEMALE:Close enough.
LEADMALE:You may begin, Carl.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Otto.
LEADFEMALE:( imitating organ playing "Bridal Chorus" ) Hold it! You ran out of carpet.
LEADMALE:EUGENE: Hey, I like your suit.
LEADMALE:Well, it's my captain's uniform.
SUPFEMALE:Let's get it in gear.
OTHERMALE:I have to study for a test.
LEADFEMALE:MORK: Oh.
SUPFEMALE:I realize you're a little nervous, but let's all try and stay calm and collected like myself.
LEADFEMALE:( speaking Orkan ) Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:( clearing throat ) Do you take this three-headed slimy thing to be your Sorry, wrong galaxy.
LEADMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:You may now join tentacles.
OTHERFEMALE:Oop, that's Ursa Minor.
SUPFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:( imitating dog growling and cat screeching ) Oh, that's Pluto.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:You kids will be able to honeymoon anywhere in the universe after this.
LEADMALE:Here it is here's Earth.
SUPMALE:Buga, bugala mala may! Bugala mala bay Wrong continent.
SUPFEMALE:( falsetto ): Oh, my baby, my baby! ( Southern drawl ): I heard they had to get married.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I'm not knocking your ceremony, but we wrote our own vows, and we'd like you to read them.
LEADMALE:As written.
SUPMALE:MORK: Oh.
LEADFEMALE:MORK: Oh, that's nice.
OTHERMALE:Do you, Eugene, take Holly to be the princess of your dreams and not make her take baths, piano lessons, or eat everything on her plate before getting dessert? I do.
LEADMALE:Do you, Holly, take Eugene to be your main man and principal squeeze and to allow him to wipe his mouth on his sleeve, eat lots of cookies and candy and pick the celery out of his tuna salad, and learn about life by watching Three's Company? I do if he does.
OTHERFEMALE:He did, the energy's right, the time is here and the gestalt is now.
OTHERFEMALE:The ring, please.
LEADMALE:I forgot it! That's all right; I'll pop for the ring.
LEADMALE:Here you go.
SUPMALE:Oh, the can's mine.
LEADFEMALE:I now pronounce you man and wife by the power invested in me by the egg in which I came.
LEADMALE:But first, step on the can.
LEADFEMALE:Matzoh bread! You may now kiss the bride.
SUPFEMALE:Kiss?! Yuck! No way.
LEADFEMALE:No way.
OTHERFEMALE:Guess I'll have to take some wedding pictures instead.
LEADMALE:Watch the flookie! You're now man and wife, yay-ay-ay! Yay-ay-ay! Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, heavy vibes; what's wrong? Mork, Eugene and Holly didn't show up for their music lessons today, and nobody knows where they are.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing in your space suit? Oh, it's my captain's uniform.
LEADFEMALE:And you don't have to worry about the kids because they're having the best afternoon of their lives.
SUPFEMALE:I married them this afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:You what?! You don't have to worry.
LEADMALE:It's legal because I'm a captain of a ship.
SUPMALE:I don't believe what I'm hearing.
LEADMALE:I didn't believe what I was hearing when they told me about the persecution from their mothers.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I did it to set them free so they can build a new world where everything will be funny.
LEADMALE:Mork, where are they now? Well, they're upstairs.
SUPFEMALE:But don't disturb them 'cause they're having the most wonderful time of their lives.
LEADMALE:They're doing everything they couldn't do before.
SUPFEMALE:They're talking with their mouths full, staying up late and eating all the little junk food that their little married hearts can hold.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you shouldn't have done that.
SUPMALE:Why not? Well, first of all, they're not old enough to be married.
LEADMALE:It's illegal.
SUPFEMALE:You have to be a certain age to get married? Of course.
OTHERMALE:Shazbot! That was the one question I never asked.
SUPFEMALE:I bet not many ten-year- olds voted for that law.
SUPFEMALE:That's what we've got to fight for now because these kids are being persecuted.
SUPFEMALE:They're not being persecuted.
LEADMALE:But they told me it was I don't care what they told you.
LEADMALE:They're not being persecuted.
SUPMALE:They're being taught, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:They're being taught things like don't play with matches, and, and eat only foods that are good for you.
SUPMALE:Things that are going to help them grow up.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I see things like don't sit on a sprinkler or don't kiss a moody rhinoceros on the lips.
SUPMALE:Yeah, sort of.
LEADMALE:See, Mork, kids don't always know what's good for them.
LEADMALE:( groaning ) Oh, my stomach.
LEADFEMALE:I must have eaten too much candy.
LEADFEMALE:I must have No offense, Holly, but marriage makes me sick.
OTHERMALE:Hey, you guys, why don't you go down and wait for me in the Jeep and I'll take you home, okay? I'll see you in a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:I'll see you later, Mork.
LEADMALE:Thanks for everything.
SUPFEMALE:See, Mork, their own parents never would have let that happen.
LEADMALE:Oh, I see.
SUPFEMALE:Parents teach children lots of valuable lessons, like never pet a porcupine.
SUPMALE:Never put out a campfire with your face.
OTHERMALE:Never sit down with a pocket full of caterpillars.
LEADFEMALE:Ay.
SUPMALE:Um Never go skinny-dipping in a pool full of piranhas.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, never get out of a closed window.
SUPFEMALE:( shouting ): Never spit into a tornado! Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in Orson.
LEADMALE:What is your report about this week, Mork? Oh, it's about a wonderful Earth custom called marriage.
OTHERFEMALE:Marriage what's that? Well, it a ceremony a man and a woman go through when they love each other very much and they want to have children.
OTHERMALE:Why do they want to have children? Well, so they can make them do all sorts of things that children will hate.
LEADMALE:So they can grow up to be better people or even adults.
OTHERMALE:Don't the children resent that? Well, some of the children feel they're being treated unfairly, and I've even heard some say they hate their mothers.
LEADFEMALE:And one, named Lizzie Borden, took it a little too far.
LEADMALE:Earth mothers must be really mean.
LEADFEMALE:As an Orkan, Your Immenseness, I have my own opinion.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to share it with you briefly for a moment.
LEADFEMALE:The only thing worse than a mother is not having one at all.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, there's something I've been meaning to ask you.
LEADMALE:Lay it on me, Your Circumference.
SUPMALE:Remember that broccoli you ate when you were three bleems old? Did you ever swallow it? ( coughs lightly ) Oh, yes, sire, it's all gone now.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, Mork.
LEADMALE:Good night, Your Eclipse.
SUPFEMALE:Na Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Nanu-nanu, Shazbot! ( typewriter keys clacking ) MINDY: "1884.
SUPMALE:"In the years following the completion of Huckleberry Finn, "which was written in 1884, Twain went on to write his most scathing criticisms.
SUPFEMALE:" Hi there.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Give you a lotta work in college, don't they? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Time and Professor Raymond wait for no man.
LEADMALE:( laughing ) What are you doing still up? Oh, me no reason.
OTHERMALE:Just thought I'd come down here and hang loose for a while.
LEADMALE:You won't even know I'm here.
LEADFEMALE:Mork Hmm? I know you're here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please don't make me leave.
LEADMALE:I'll do anything.
SUPFEMALE:I'll shovel the dishes I'll wash the snow but don't make me go back upstairs to him! Please.
LEADMALE:Him? Him who? Vincent Price.
LEADFEMALE:He's upstairs in the TV in the attic.
OTHERMALE:Mork, why don't you turn him off? I did and then it became real dark.
LEADMALE:Don't tell me you're afraid of a TV show.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey! What do ya think, I just got off the egg yesterday? Vincent Price doesn't scare me.
LEADMALE:It was the ghosts.
SUPFEMALE:And the swamp and that dude with his head cut off, carrying it in his hands.
SUPFEMALE:And the whooo! ( panting ) That's what got to me, boy.
OTHERMALE:But Mork, that movie's on everybody's TV.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, we need a lot more blankets then.
OTHERMALE:Mindy, why didn't you tell me about ghosts? Well, I didn't tell you about ghosts because there is no such thing as ghosts.
SUPFEMALE:( squeaking ) And Vincent Price is a nice man.
LEADMALE:He doesn't live in a swamp.
LEADMALE:He makes soufflÃ©s and sells art at Sears.
SUPMALE:And there's no such thing as ghosts, too.
LEADFEMALE:Do you believe me? All right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad you got that off your chest.
LEADMALE:If there's anything else you'd like to chat about, I'm here anytime you need me.
LEADMALE:( chuckling ) Why don't we chat about you going upstairs while I finish my report? All right, if the subject's upsetting to you, we can always change it.
SUPMALE:How about those basketball players? Those suckers sure are big, aren't they? Look, Mork, after tomorrow, we can spend a lot of time together.
OTHERFEMALE:I know, we'll go away somewhere.
SUPMALE:We'll chat about anything you want, but right now I've gotta finish this.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:A mind's a terrible thing to waste.
LEADMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:We'll get you that vacation.
LEADMALE:Vincent Price he's real old, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Ghosts Whooo! Who could be scared of that? Whoo! Ciao.
LEADFEMALE:Night.
SUPFEMALE:Everything's just ( loud bang ) ( screaming ) Somebody here call a cab? Oh, yes.
SUPMALE:Uh, ma'am, your cab's here.
LEADFEMALE:That's awfully kind of you, soldier.
SUPFEMALE:Here's a quarter.
SUPMALE:Next time you're at the U.
SUPMALE:S.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADMALE:, you have 2Â½ dances on me.
OTHERMALE:You know, your army's doing a fantastic job.
LEADMALE:Since I've been here, I haven't seen one Necroton.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:Listen, Mindy isn't here now.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:She slept in.
LEADMALE:She stayed up till 5:00 last night to finish that report for school.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, I'm glad she finally did it.
OTHERMALE:She's been working hard on that for a long time.
SUPFEMALE:That's what I came to talk to you about.
LEADFEMALE:I think she needs to get away for a couple of days, rest.
LEADMALE:Well, do you have any place in mind? Yes, I'd like to take her to the Dog Star, Sirius.
SUPFEMALE:It's incredible to see a whole galaxy fetch.
SUPMALE:I still think it might be hard to fit that into a couple of days.
SUPMALE:I don't believe it Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I've seen it all.
OTHERFEMALE:What? If I should go belly up tomorrow, you can put "She saw it all" on my tombstone.
OTHERMALE:What are you talking about? Well, I've met a man from outer space.
LEADMALE:That's nothing compared to that student out in back.
LEADFEMALE:This bozo looks so weird, he makes Mork look like a Republican.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my kind of guy.
LEADMALE:Do you think I should observe him? Somebody should keep him under observation.
LEADMALE:Step aside, don't push! We can't all get through the door at the same time.
SUPMALE:Exidor! Mork, is that you? I'm over here.
LEADMALE:Would you step aside? I can't see.
SUPMALE:Ah there you are.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, my old friend, you've grown.
LEADMALE:Oh, I can't take any more of this.
OTHERMALE:What time is it? Uh, it's 9:30.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Time for lunch.
SUPFEMALE:See you later.
LEADFEMALE:Lovely woman, but strange.
SUPMALE:Exidor, you remember Pops? Are you Chinese? Uh no.
LEADMALE:Oh, I was in the mood for a fortune cookie.
SUPMALE:FRED: Oh, well, if, if you'll excuse me, I have a client.
LEADFEMALE:One that wears pants.
SUPFEMALE:The man exudes charm.
LEADFEMALE:I have a feeling in a previous life he was a dust cover.
SUPMALE:So, how's the preaching business? Behind me.
SUPFEMALE:I have to look to the future.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, do you have any idea how old I am? Wrong! Next Wednesday afternoon I'll be 12 years old.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, you're awfully mature for your age.
LEADFEMALE:Guilt without sex! That's the key.
SUPMALE:I'm too old to stand on street corners preaching.
LEADMALE:I've got to settle down.
LEADMALE:Get a straight conventional job.
SUPFEMALE:What do you think you'd like to be? Emperor of the Earth! Exidor the Emperor.
SUPFEMALE:Has a nice ring to it.
LEADMALE:You won't be taking anybody else's job.
LEADFEMALE:I know what I can do.
SUPMALE:I'll help you get elected.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be your campaign manager.
OTHERFEMALE:I know what we'll do.
SUPMALE:First we'll get a tub to thump, some babies to kiss.
SUPFEMALE:Then we'll get another set of lips so you can talk out of both sides of your mouth.
LEADFEMALE:Mork! Yes, yes! I know it'll work.
LEADFEMALE:Then we'll get you some hands to shake.
LEADFEMALE:Some backs to slap.
OTHERMALE:We could get you some money to pass under a table.
LEADMALE:A laundry to clean it, a Korean park.
SUPMALE:Mork! I know, we'll build a public image for you.
LEADMALE:First of all, you'll have a debate.
LEADMALE:You'll lose it.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll make a come-back.
SUPMALE:Then you rent a motel.
SUPMALE:You get Cuban burglars to break into it.
LEADFEMALE:Then you have some tapes.
LEADFEMALE:on the tapes.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, wise up! You can't get elected Emperor.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have any idea who runs this world? Wrong again! I'll tell you who runs this world.
LEADFEMALE:Joe Cocker! No! Yes.
LEADMALE:Mick Jagger.
SUPMALE:Him, too? Bette Midler.
SUPMALE:I'd serve under her.
SUPMALE:Yes, rock stars, Mork.
LEADMALE:Rock stars.
LEADMALE:And they don't have a leader until now.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to be the rock star.
SUPMALE:That's why I'm taking lessons from Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Hudson.
SUPMALE:I'm going out on tour, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:We'll start slow at first.
LEADMALE:The Superdome The Garden Woodstock.
OTHERFEMALE:Then jump across the big pond England France.
SUPFEMALE:( with German accent ): I'll take France in 26 days.
LEADMALE:Then we sweep across Europe, amplifiers blaring.
SUPFEMALE:We take Russia, China.
LEADFEMALE:We take Africa.
OTHERFEMALE:And then they make me emperor.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds reasonable.
LEADFEMALE:You can say you knew me then, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You've been a good friend to me.
LEADFEMALE:Anything you ever want, come to me.
SUPMALE:Well, there is one favor I'd like to ask of you.
SUPFEMALE:Name it.
LEADMALE:Well, see, Mindy's been working very hard, and she needs a place Would you stop playing with that thing.
LEADFEMALE:The man needs a favor.
SUPMALE:No big deal.
LEADMALE:Exidor, Mindy needs a place where she can go rest for a couple of days, get away from it all.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like to drive or take a little hike? I'll take the hike.
SUPMALE:I have the perfect place.
SUPFEMALE:My summer home.
OTHERFEMALE:You have a summer home? I bought it four years ago when I was a doctor.
LEADMALE:Now this is the scenic route.
LEADMALE:You park your car here and walk the three miles to the cabin.
LEADFEMALE:But that's a lake.
LEADMALE:Oh you walk around the lake.
LEADMALE:Exidor walks across the lake.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Exidor.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy'll really appreciate that.
SUPFEMALE:An emperor takes care of his subjects.
LEADFEMALE:Have a nice vacation.
LEADMALE:You have a nice career, but there's one thing.
SUPMALE:Your plan to become emperor sounds really good, but it relies on one thing your having talent.
OTHERMALE:Well, that's never stopped any rock group before.
LEADMALE:Besides, you've never seen me perform.
OTHERMALE:Mork, you wait right here.
LEADMALE:I'll get my ax.
LEADMALE:Give me an intro, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, get ready to get down into a tucked position 'cause you're gonna be blown out of your shorts and into your socks.
SUPFEMALE:Here he comes, let's all get down here, get back up again.
LEADFEMALE:Here he comes, the Duke of Disco, the Prince of Punk, the King of Rock and Roll, the future Emperor of the World, let's bring him out here, Exidor and the Proph-ettes! ( discordant accordion chords ) ( singing off-key ): Lady of Spain, I adore you Right from the night I first saw you My heart has been yearning for you MINDY: Mork, I am freezing.
SUPFEMALE:MORK: Come on, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:We're almost there.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, I can't believe we finally made it.
LEADFEMALE:( groaning ) I thought you were supposed to be such a trailblazer.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I made it from Ork to Earth, but there were no trees.
OTHERFEMALE:I wonder when we lost the trail.
OTHERMALE:I suspect it was right before we fell off the cliff.
LEADMALE:Well, I owe you an apology.
LEADFEMALE:Next time you can land on me.
SUPFEMALE:How's your ankle? Ow.
LEADMALE:It's still sprained.
LEADMALE:But at least now the toes are finally facing forward.
SUPMALE:Well, tomorrow morning I'll go looking for our luggage.
SUPMALE:I hope it didn't sink.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure you heard a splash? I don't know if it was that or the avalanche.
LEADMALE:I hope that beaver isn't hurt.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what was a beaver doing out strolling in the middle of the night anyway? Why wasn't he in his darn dam guarding his sticks and his twigs? Do you know how yucky it is to step on a beaver's tail? I didn't know those little suckers could scream.
LEADFEMALE:( imitating beaver screaming ) Well, he won't be sending any more little beaver messages with that tail for a while.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, you're not gonna have a nice weekend if you keep up with those negative thoughts.
LEADMALE:Mork, I stepped on a beaver, I fell off a cliff and you landed on me, I sprained my ankle and my luggage is shooting the rapids on the way to Lake Mead.
LEADMALE:And your scenic little three-mile hike was up the face of a cliff.
LEADMALE:I knew we were in big trouble when that mountain goat tumbled by.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I didn't know they could scream either.
LEADMALE:I'm cold and I can't walk anymore and I'm freezing to death.
SUPMALE:But you're right.
LEADMALE:You are right.
LEADFEMALE:Why should I be negative? What else could possibly happen? Well, I could have lost the key.
OTHERFEMALE:( barking laugh ) Just open the door.
LEADMALE:You lost the key? No, he never gave me one.
LEADFEMALE:What! Mork, we'll freeze to death if we stay out here.
LEADMALE:Kick the door in.
SUPFEMALE:But it's my friend's Kick the door in.
LEADFEMALE:But on Ork we Kick the door in.
LEADFEMALE:But Kick.
SUPMALE:( weak kick ) Mork It wasn't locked.
LEADMALE:Oh, dopey me! MORK: Well, we better hit the sack now.
LEADMALE:Tell you what, I'll flip you for the top bunk.
LEADFEMALE:You can have it.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think I could stand the climb.
LEADFEMALE:Kay-o.
LEADMALE:Looks like we'll be sleeping on Mr.
LEADMALE:Floor tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I wish there was some way back to the car.
LEADFEMALE:We got lost during daylight.
LEADFEMALE:Imagine what it'd be like at night.
LEADFEMALE:And, besides, that beaver's out looking for us.
OTHERMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:I guess there's nothing we can do but just make the best of this.
LEADMALE:Well, you gotta look at the good side, though.
OTHERMALE:At least have three walls and a roof over our heads.
LEADMALE:Well, if it wasn't snowing, the stars would be awfully pretty.
SUPMALE:Oh, isn't this fun? ( chuckles lightly ) I love eating out.
OTHERMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:Somehow I just can't picture John Wayne sitting in front of a roaring campfire roasting Vienna sausage.
OTHERMALE:That's all Exidor had in the cabinet.
LEADMALE:That and the mouse.
LEADMALE:Mork, that wasn't a mouse.
OTHERFEMALE:It was a moldy, fuzzy gray avocado.
SUPFEMALE:But it crawled.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:Do you know that the only thing between us and death is this fire? We've gotta do something else to get warm.
LEADMALE:Hey, wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:What about this little trunk? Mindy, both of us couldn't fit in there.
SUPFEMALE:Although it might be fun to try.
SUPMALE:( honking bark ) No, I mean, there might be some old blankets or clothes in there.
LEADMALE:I know that.
LEADFEMALE:Who do you think you're talking to, Morko the pinheaded boy? Wait, don't open it.
SUPMALE:Do you think that avocado could have crawled in there? Wait! No, there's no trail of guacamole, we're safe.
LEADMALE:What's this? Confessions of a Schizophrenic by Exidor as told to Exidor.
SUPFEMALE:Here's something.
SUPMALE:Wait.
OTHERMALE:Oh, wait.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, look his and hers prophet robes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, at least they're made out of flannel.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty tired.
SUPFEMALE:Time to hit the old sack.
LEADFEMALE:No place to hang, so I guess I'll just have to rough it and sleep horizontal.
LEADMALE:No, Mork, you don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:If we fall asleep and the fire goes out, we'll freeze to death.
LEADMALE:You mean stiff city? Oh, I suggest we stay awake.
SUPFEMALE:We'll be as tight as two cubes in a tray.
SUPMALE:( honking bark ) Well, what do you do to stay awake when you go camping? Well, we, we used to roast marshmallows and sing songs.
SUPMALE:Sing songs, that's it.
SUPMALE:Here we go, hit it.
LEADFEMALE:( sings in Orkan to tune of "99 Bottles of Beer" ) Come on, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Join in anytime.
LEADFEMALE:( singing in Orkan ) Come on.
SUPMALE:I don't know how to count backwards in Orkan.
SUPMALE:Oh, bummer.
LEADMALE:Here's one that's universal.
LEADMALE:Kumbaya Well, what else can we do? Well, we used to tell ghost stories by the campfire.
LEADMALE:Oh, that'd be fun.
SUPFEMALE:Let's do it.
SUPMALE:Come on, come on, come on, let's do it.
LEADMALE:No, I'm not telling you a ghost story.
SUPMALE:Come on, come on! No, you'll get scared.
SUPMALE:I'm not telling you.
OTHERFEMALE:I won't get scared.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, would you rather be a snow cone? Let's do it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Uh, there was this spooky old house sitting at, way at the top of a hill No! No! All right, go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm? Wake up.
SUPFEMALE:Wake up.
SUPFEMALE:We fell asleep.
LEADFEMALE:Look.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:We have to get it going again.
OTHERMALE:Here, stir the embers.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm so cold.
LEADFEMALE:Cold.
LEADMALE:Any matches? Ah, okay.
SUPMALE:I can't find the matches.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:I, I can't find my pockets.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't feel my hands.
SUPFEMALE:I can't Oh, I've got my gloves on.
LEADMALE:Oh, let's see.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, ah! I got 'em.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha, ha.
LEADMALE:Oh, only one match left.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:But there's still six hours left until daylight.
LEADFEMALE:If we don't get this fire going, we're not gonna make it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do it.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay, read the instructions.
SUPFEMALE:"Close cover before striking.
LEADFEMALE:" Look, Mindy, you can finish high school in your spare time.
SUPMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Please ( cackles hysterically ) I saw that in a movie once.
LEADMALE:Hey, I've got it.
SUPMALE:You can start the fire with your finger.
LEADFEMALE:That's a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:Except it only works when it's above 60 degrees.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Mindy.
LEADMALE:We've gotta keep moving.
LEADFEMALE:Gotta keep the circulation going.
LEADFEMALE:Stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I can't.
LEADMALE:Well, come on, girl.
SUPFEMALE:You gotta take the bull by the tentacles.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:I can't, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:I just, I can't.
LEADMALE:Ah, you're right.
SUPMALE:Who am I kidding? I can't walk either.
LEADMALE:Mindy.
OTHERMALE:Ah, I'm sorry I got you into this.
LEADFEMALE:Ever since you've met me, I've been getting you into trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, don't be silly.
SUPFEMALE:I wouldn't trade a minute of the time we've spent together.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I remember the first time I saw you.
OTHERMALE:You had your suit on backwards.
LEADFEMALE:I remember the first emotion you taught me happiness.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just sorry that the last emotion we're sharing is fear.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I guess I am afraid.
LEADMALE:It's nice to be sharing it, though.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Mork, why don't you try to make it down the mountain yourself? I mean, what have you got to lose? You.
LEADFEMALE:You know, whenever people have the time, they never get around to saying the things they really want to say.
LEADMALE:Now I really want you to know how I feel.
SUPMALE:You don't have to.
OTHERFEMALE:I know how you feel.
OTHERFEMALE:And I know how you feel.
SUPMALE:( car approaching ) You hear something? What? It sounds like a car.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, you have to have a road to have a car.
OTHERFEMALE:( man singing ): Lady of Spain, I adore you What's that? It's the future emperor of the world.
LEADMALE:And he just got my vote.
LEADMALE:I told you to wait in the Jeep.
SUPFEMALE:We can't just go barging in on them, after all, they've got a life.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, Mork.
LEADMALE:Have any trouble getting in? You have a Jeep? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:About 30 yards away on a fire road.
SUPFEMALE:I was packing to go out on tour and I remembered I hadn't given you a key to the cabin.
LEADMALE:You mean we could have driven up here? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:But you said you wanted to go for a hike.
OTHERFEMALE:How'd you like the scenic route? We don't make cliffs like that anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Well, here's the key.
SUPFEMALE:Have a nice weekend.
LEADMALE:Exidor.
SUPMALE:Mindy hurt her ankle.
LEADFEMALE:Can you please give us a ride down the hill? Sure, if you don't mind the seven of us jammed into one tiny little Jeep.
LEADMALE:Seven people sounds wonderfully warm.
OTHERMALE:But his kind of people don't have much warmth.
LEADMALE:Zippo.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry what happened to the cabin.
OTHERFEMALE:What's wrong with it? Well, let's go, boys.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure is a beautiful night.
SUPMALE:It sure is.
OTHERMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:( beeps ) Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:( low buzz ) Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:( low buzz ) Oh, "For a good time, dial Mary Jo.
LEADFEMALE:" ORSON: What do you have to report this week, Mork? Oh, this week, Your Immenseness, I would like to discuss the silliness of Earth language.
OTHERFEMALE:Believe it or not, Your Acreage, here words can mean more than one thing.
OTHERMALE:That's illogical.
LEADMALE:Ha, I know, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Take, for example, the word "run.
SUPMALE:" Run can mean this rivers running people run down and men can run stores.
LEADMALE:Miss Filmon, a sale in lingerie.
SUPMALE:Also, the female of the species can get a run in her stockings.
OTHERFEMALE:( female voice ): Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:It all sounds very confusing.
SUPFEMALE:I know, sir, but they still manage to communicate.
LEADMALE:For example, the word "buck.
LEADMALE:" They know when to pass it and when to spend it.
LEADMALE:How do Earth people understand each other? Many times they don't.
SUPMALE:Sometimes humans find it very difficult to tell each other how they feel about one another until it's too late.
SUPFEMALE:Pity.
LEADFEMALE:I know, sir.
SUPMALE:They have a strange custom here.
LEADMALE:I believe people should receive flowers while they're still alive, not after they're gone.
OTHERMALE:For example, sir, I never told you that I like you and I do.
SUPMALE:Orson Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu.
OTHERFEMALE:How'd you know I had the munchies? 
LEADFEMALE:Na-nu, na-nu.
LEADFEMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! MORK: Mindy, mind if we start without you? MINDY: No, go ahead.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be out in a minute.
OTHERMALE:How about that new Pope, huh? Well So King Kong's finally up the Empire State Building and he's got Fay Wray.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, careful there, my son, you'll hurt yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:He's got Fay Wray and she says, ( high voice ): "Put me down, put me down.
LEADMALE:" He goes: ( deep voice ) "Okay.
LEADMALE:" Yeah, I guess that kind of bit the big one.
SUPFEMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:What is that?! Oh, Mindy, it's not a what.
SUPFEMALE:It's a "who".
SUPMALE:I'd like you to meet O'Keefe! ( squeaking ) But you didn't tell me he was a chimpanzee! I also didn't tell you he's on the lam.
LEADFEMALE:He's a con.
LEADMALE:He's a what? MORK: He's a fugitive.
LEADMALE:He said there's no zoo in the country that'll hold him inside.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, where did you find him? Well, I was up in a tree observing bald spots on human beings.
LEADMALE:I was up to 85 men and all of a sudden I realized something hairy was watching me.
LEADFEMALE:So all of a sudden, I thought, "Hey, let's bring him home.
LEADFEMALE:" He'll cheer you up, and besides I'm not sending him back to the Big House with those rotten screws.
OTHERMALE:MINDY: Mork, that's ridiculous.
OTHERFEMALE:He's got to go back to the zoo.
LEADFEMALE:No! You see? No way.
SUPFEMALE:They'll put him on banana bread and water.
LEADMALE:They'll take away his tire.
LEADMALE:Mindy, who are you kidding? It's a jungle in there.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, they don't do that to animals.
SUPFEMALE:At the zoo he'll get food and protection and love.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:And besides, running around free he might hurt himself.
SUPMALE:Well I wouldn't want that to happen.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you heard the warden.
LEADMALE:I guess I've got to take you back to your cell.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, old friend.
SUPFEMALE:Go upstairs and start packing.
LEADFEMALE:But don't worry we'll arrange conjugal visits with Cheetah.
LEADMALE:And I'll send you a banana with a file in it.
LEADMALE:But look at this, Mindy.
OTHERMALE:He taught me a dance.
LEADFEMALE:It's the funky-monkey hustle.
OTHERFEMALE:Watch.
SUPMALE:( makes chimp sounds ) Come on, Mindy don't be afraid.
OTHERMALE:Come on, don't be Mork, you've been acting awfully strange lately.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, more strange than usual.
LEADMALE:Ah, you've noticed.
SUPMALE:Noticed? How could I help it? Like yesterday, you spent all day walking and talking backwards.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's all behind me now.
SUPMALE:Well, what's next? I'm glad you asked.
OTHERMALE:Well, today, I thought I'd go out and buy 400 balloons and a tank of nitrous oxide and some calves liver.
SUPMALE:Mork, why are you doing all these strange things? To cheer you up.
LEADMALE:But I'm not sad.
LEADFEMALE:But you will be after you hear the news that I have to tell you.
LEADFEMALE:What news? Well, I've got orders from Orson.
LEADFEMALE:I've been transferred to another planet and I'll never ever see you again.
LEADFEMALE:What? Well, you've got to look at the good side.
SUPMALE:You're not losing an alien.
SUPMALE:You're-you're gaining an empty room.
SUPMALE:FRED: Well, I have a very fine set here and it has some very good attachments that go with it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Okay I'll take them.
SUPMALE:It-it doesn't work quite as well without the cord.
LEADMALE:You're not going to be able to hear a thing.
LEADFEMALE:Perfect.
SUPFEMALE:I want to keep noise out.
OTHERMALE:If I hear anything, I'll bring them back.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's your money.
OTHERFEMALE:That'll be $50.
LEADFEMALE:These work fine.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't hear a word you said.
SUPMALE:I said that'll be $50.
LEADFEMALE:Will you take a check? Certainly.
LEADMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:Get it from your daughter.
LEADMALE:Hey, wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:You just can't walk out of here.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean, get it from Mindy? Listen, I live underneath your daughter and I work at home.
SUPFEMALE:I write greeting cards.
LEADMALE:Ah you're Buckley.
LEADMALE:Bickley.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, Mindy's told me about you.
LEADMALE:Well, Let me tell you about her.
LEADFEMALE:I can't concentrate with all that racket.
SUPMALE:How do you expect me to write sympathy cards with her crying all morning? Crying? Why was she crying? Who cares? Crying is crying.
LEADFEMALE:Find out from her when you hit her up about the check.
OTHERMALE:Yes, but you just can't Oh, Dad Honey, what's wrong? Oh, brother! Honey, what is it? Oh, something awful has happened.
LEADFEMALE:Mork's been transferred to another planet.
LEADMALE:I'll probably never see him again.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Oh when is he leaving? In a couple of days.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, what am I gonna do? Mork he's just about my best friend, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure glad I don't read lips.
OTHERFEMALE:Mindy! Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:And Mindy's dad hi, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:McConnell.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Susan.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Listen, I was just in the jewelry store across the street buying myself a numero uno charm Susan, I think maybe some other time Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, are we a little depressed today? Yeah, she's a lot depressed.
LEADMALE:Personal reasons.
SUPMALE:Well, of course, I was never one to pry.
SUPFEMALE:All I can tell you is, I used to get all these emotional ups and downs all the time at the least little thing.
SUPFEMALE:But that was before I got ERK.
LEADMALE:What's ERK? Oh, Mindy E.
LEADFEMALE:R.
SUPMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Ellsworth Revitalization Konditioning.
SUPFEMALE:I don't mean to be picky, but you spell "conditioning" with a "C".
SUPMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:Maybe you do, but Ellsworth doesn't.
SUPMALE:Ellsworth says that spelling is just another hang-up.
OTHERFEMALE:So, how about it? Susan, I just don't feel up to it today.
LEADMALE:Hey, grab yourself a cup and I'll split my lunch with you.
SUPMALE:Thanks, but I'm not into toy cocktails.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, Mindy, I mean, you can do this if you want, but just remember, you're going to be going through emotional ups and downs for the rest of your life until you find something like ERK.
LEADMALE:You see, Ellsworth teaches you to love yourself.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet you got an "A".
LEADMALE:"A" plus.
SUPFEMALE:Ta-ta.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, oh, have I got a surprise for you.
SUPMALE:Oh, I've got a surprise for you.
LEADFEMALE:There we stay.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, you'll never guess what's in the bag.
OTHERFEMALE:Take a flying guess.
SUPMALE:Come on, take a flying guess.
SUPMALE:Mork, I don't feel like guessing.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I'll guess it for you myself.
LEADMALE:Time to play "What's my bag"! ( falsetto ): Uh, mystery object, are you a shovel? ( deep voice ): No! Are you a Synanon joke book? No.
LEADMALE:I give up.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess I'll have to tell myself.
SUPMALE:And to present the prize, our lovely prize girl, Lola.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Otto.
LEADFEMALE:Guess what it is, Mindy! It's a going away present for Mindy and it's an exciting new gift I got this morning on the street corner.
OTHERFEMALE:It's Zen-O-Matic.
SUPMALE:It's a what? It's Zen-O-Matic, the exciting new kitchen tool that does absolutely nothing.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:It can't dice, it can't peel, it can't chop it won't even make julienne fries whatever those are.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, Zen-O-Matic does didley for you.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, the exciting new kitchen tool from the people who brought you frozen sand and electric toothpaste.
LEADMALE:Send absolutely nothing today to Buhdda Productions care of Nirvana, Box Omm Get one today! I appreciate what you're trying to do.
OTHERMALE:I really do.
LEADFEMALE:But I'm just not in the mood for it right now.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you don't have to be sad on account of me.
SUPFEMALE:How can I help it? You're being sent off to some remote corner of the universe.
SUPFEMALE:I don't even know where.
SUPMALE:It's not that far away.
LEADMALE:It's just the other side of the universe.
LEADMALE:It's the Sigma Seven Galaxy.
SUPMALE:It's a troubled planet called Tsoorus.
LEADMALE:And the people there aren't very friendly, but the good thing is they're tiny.
LEADFEMALE:Even in their most vicious mood, they can only bite you below the ankle.
OTHERMALE:How can you let Orson do this to you? Well, maybe you're afraid of him, but I'm not.
LEADMALE:Plug me into your head.
LEADMALE:I want to talk to that fat fascist.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I forgot to tell you.
LEADFEMALE:You see, I talked to him this afternoon.
OTHERFEMALE:You did? What did he say? Well, Mindy, I've been thinking this over a lot and I don't think I'm very much good for you.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I do silly things I make weird objects I talk to furniture and leave you out of the conversation I'm always getting in the way I bring home strange people.
LEADFEMALE:I see.
SUPFEMALE:Orson wouldn't change his mind.
LEADMALE:No, I talked to Orson for a real long time and he said I could stay on Earth as long as I want.
LEADFEMALE:He did?! That's wonderful.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it's nice to have a choice and I chose to leave.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, but why? Why would you want to leave here? Are you unhappy? Is it something that I've done? Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:It's something you have.
LEADFEMALE:Emotions.
LEADFEMALE:That doesn't make sense.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, it does.
LEADFEMALE:See, one day I'm going to have to leave the earth, and it's going to hurt you very much.
SUPMALE:I've only been here a few months and look how you feel.
LEADMALE:Imagine what it would be like after ten years? The longer I stay, the harder it will be for you.
LEADMALE:But what about you? Me? The Cosmic Charles Bronson? I don't have a heart.
LEADMALE:It won't be a problem for me.
LEADMALE:It's a problem for me.
OTHERMALE:I've got a big adjustment to make getting used to no Mork.
LEADFEMALE:I know what I can do get O'Keefe out on parole.
LEADFEMALE:It'll be almost like having me around.
LEADFEMALE:It'll be a lot like having you around.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what a nice thing to say.
SUPFEMALE:( knock on door ) Who is it? BICKLEY: Miss McConnell Oh, no Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley, please, we are not making any noise.
SUPMALE:We're not doing anything.
LEADFEMALE:I know that.
LEADMALE:I was just downstairs feeling depressed.
SUPMALE:I thought I'd come up here and share it with you.
LEADMALE:Ah, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Pickley! That's nice.
SUPMALE:That's Bickley.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mindy, let him come in.
LEADFEMALE:He has something to share.
LEADMALE:Something really nice.

OTHERFEMALE:Paul Williams? No ERK.
SUPFEMALE:You people have got to get ERK.
OTHERMALE:You've been irking me since you came in.
SUPMALE:Mindy, listen.
LEADFEMALE:ERK would help you with your depression and Mr.

LEADFEMALE:I drink fine by myself.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and, Mork, I bet he could come up with something for you.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:That sounds exciting.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Mindy, let's not poop the party.
LEADMALE:Ellsworth might be able to help both of us, and besides, I don't want to leave you like this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mindy, come on.
LEADMALE:Look, it would do you some good and I am not going to take "no" for an answer.
SUPMALE:I am going to sit right here until I get your word on it, and that goes for you, too, Mr.

LEADFEMALE:Bickley! SUSAN: Oh, Ellsworth, before we get started I have a couple of friends I'm dying for you to meet.
SUPMALE:Two of my closest friends in the entire world.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Mork and Mindy This is Ellsworth.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ellsworth, you know, we're so lucky to have a man like you, so unselfish with a special gift Yeah, Excuse me.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me, could you hold that thought just a moment? Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:Okay, we're all set.

LEADMALE:Yeah, it sure is.
OTHERMALE:Okay, the agreement was for 8:00.
SUPFEMALE:Let's begin the session, all right? Oh, right.
OTHERMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, everybody, places, places.
LEADFEMALE:Ellsworth is ready.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you're really going to hear something now.

OTHERFEMALE:ALL: Hellooo.
SUPMALE:Is that it? You people are all dipsticks.
SUPMALE:You're scuzz! The next question is, of course, what will you be doing here? Susan? Well, we will be trying to find our own space.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, very good, Susan, very good.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, you have an item, Mork? Uh A point of Ellsworth order.
SUPMALE:Um my item is simply this.
LEADFEMALE:It seems like Susan has her own space.
SUPFEMALE:This is her apartment and there's barely enough room for any of us.
LEADMALE:That's a joke.
LEADFEMALE:You're out of order, pal.
LEADFEMALE:But it's a reality.
SUPFEMALE:Reality is nothing more than a concept.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, but it's truth.
LEADMALE:This is truth Sit down and shut up.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Now it's sharing time.
OTHERMALE:This is the time when you people will say whatever is on your mind.
LEADMALE:Say whatever you think will set you free.
SUPFEMALE:Who wants to begin here? Susan.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Um Well, it-it used to bother me and intimidate me that I was so much more beautiful than anyone else, but since I got ERK, I discovered that I just have to learn to live with the fact that I'm fun to be near, and just love myself as the rest of the world does.
OTHERFEMALE:Anyone else? I'm having trouble understanding any of this.
OTHERMALE:Perhaps you can understand this.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down and shut up.
LEADMALE:Anyone else have something to share? Uh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Uh Wait.
OTHERMALE:I have some very fine Kentucky bourbon here.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to share it with somebody who has some soda.
LEADFEMALE:Obviously you're new.
SUPFEMALE:You don't know about our agreement.
OTHERMALE:Getting ERK is not easy.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes these sessions last up to 15 hours and during that time, there will be no eating.
SUPMALE:Who cares? No going to the bathroom.
LEADMALE:Big deal.
LEADFEMALE:No drinking.
SUPFEMALE:Wait till you try to cash my check.
LEADFEMALE:I have something that I would like to share.
LEADMALE:ERK is not a process.
SUPFEMALE:ERK is something that happens in space.
LEADMALE:In fact it may be space.
OTHERMALE:It's definitely not space.
LEADFEMALE:Space is a continuum an inf wait.
LEADMALE:Don't tell me.
LEADMALE:"Sit down and shut up.
SUPMALE:" Yes, Mindy, you have an item? My item is that I paid a lot of money to come here and learn something.
SUPFEMALE:( laughing ) Well, then you've learned something important already, haven't you? What? You have been conned.
LEADFEMALE:That's terrible.
LEADFEMALE:"Terrible" is just a concept.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I get it.
LEADFEMALE:Anything that you don't want to talk about is just a concept.
OTHERFEMALE:No, not my Rolls-Royce.
OTHERFEMALE:That's real.
LEADMALE:Why don't you go ahead and sit down, Mindy? We've caught your act.
OTHERMALE:Well.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Ellsworth, I have another point of order.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, go right ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, I think it's a biggie.
LEADMALE:People don't come here for humiliation and abuse.
SUPFEMALE:Every creature in the universe is entitled to respect.
LEADMALE:Ridiculous.
LEADMALE:Nobody wants to hear that message.
SUPFEMALE:Sit down and shut up.
LEADFEMALE:But you said to say what was on our mind.
LEADMALE:Well, I've changed the rules.
SUPFEMALE:But not before I get one more thing in.
LEADMALE:I think you should be honest with yourself, like yourself, trust yourself and know yourself.
LEADMALE:That's all you ever need to know.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, that's beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Did Orson tell you that? No, Leon Spinks.
OTHERMALE:Oh, there's one other thing I'd like to talk about This concept of not letting people go to the bathroom.
OTHERMALE:Well, I myself can't sit still for that and I think we should all take a rest break right now.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think, everyone? ALL: Yeah.
LEADMALE:Take a rest break, everyone.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:What about the agreement? I think we just changed the rules.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:All right, those people want to leave? Those people who want to drop out, fine.
SUPMALE:I'm still the winner.
SUPFEMALE:I get to go home early.
SUPFEMALE:I've got all your money and most importantly, I've got my Rolls-Royce.
SUPMALE:Thank you so much.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he's cute.
SUPMALE:My Rolls-Royce.
LEADMALE:My Is Somebody has stolen my Rolls-Royce.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, don't worry, Ellsworth, just losing your Rolls-Royce is a concept.
OTHERMALE:Getting it back is a reality.
SUPMALE:MORK: Well, it's good-bye, apartment.
SUPMALE:Fern, I love ya.
LEADFEMALE:Phil, get rid of that dendron.
LEADMALE:Sofie, you've been a great lie.
LEADFEMALE:Take it easy, chair.
OTHERFEMALE:( honking bark ) Good-bye, walls.
SUPMALE:Good-bye, air.
LEADFEMALE:Good-bye, little tiny dust particle.
LEADFEMALE:Good-bye, electrons.
LEADMALE:Good-bye, protons.
SUPMALE:Good-bye, nucleus.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, before you finish saying your good-byes, which at this rate could be some time around mid-September, I want to talk to you for a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I've been doing some observing, and I learned something last night at the meeting.
LEADMALE:You don't practice what you preach.
LEADFEMALE:Mayday.
LEADMALE:Sense of verbal confusion.
OTHERMALE:Well, at the meeting last night, you talked about knowing yourself.
OTHERMALE:Well, let me tell you something.
SUPMALE:You might not have had emotions when you arrived here, but you've got them now.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't.
LEADMALE:Sit down and shut up.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody could have said all those wonderful things without feeling them.
OTHERMALE:And I figured something else out, too.
LEADMALE:You're not leaving because of me.
LEADMALE:You're leaving because of you.
LEADMALE:I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.
LEADMALE:I'm not, I'm not.
SUPFEMALE:You're the one who won't be able to handle leaving if you stay much longer.
LEADMALE:Me? ( honking bark ) Yeah, I don't want to go home.
LEADFEMALE:It's cold out there.
SUPFEMALE:Who else will let me do the things you do? I'm gonna miss you.
LEADMALE:I feel humiliation and guilt.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, you don't have to feel guilty about having emotions.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Orson said emotions are bad for you.
SUPMALE:We'll never evolve if you have emotions.
LEADMALE:Shh! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Boy, is he a nimnull! Where are you going? I'm going upstairs to talk to Orson.
LEADMALE:I'm not leaving.
OTHERFEMALE:( laughing ) You're not? No way.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, having feelings is good.
LEADFEMALE:I'm back, Jack.
LEADMALE:Mork, calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork, calling Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork, calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Taxi! ( imitates speeding car ) ( growls ) ORSON: Orson speaking.
LEADMALE:Well, are you ready to leave? Oh, no, Your Immenseness.
SUPMALE:I've decided to stay.
LEADMALE:Mork, are you sure you want to extend your Earth visit? Oh, yes, Your Girthship.
LEADFEMALE:I want to continue my observation of human emotions especially guilt.
LEADMALE:Emotions? Does everyone have them? Absolutely everyone.
LEADFEMALE:Well, with the possible exception of a few presidents.
SUPMALE:What are presidents? Well, they're elected officials who are sent to Washington every four years to bring the country to financial ruin, recognize Chinese and throw a baseball out once every spring.
OTHERMALE:Is that all? Well, I've also observed that they never tell a lie, but then again, they never tell the truth.
LEADMALE:It's something called politics.
SUPFEMALE:And they also have a power that's feared very much by everyone called "veto.
SUPFEMALE:" What's that? I'm not sure, but I think it's an Italian bodyguard.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds dull.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, sir.
LEADFEMALE:The big bucks comes when you get to be an ex-president.
LEADMALE:Then publishers pay you millions of dollars to write things called memoirs, but the strange part is they don't have very good memories, and the really funny part is no one buys those books.
LEADMALE:( honking bark ) Well, that's all she wrote, Your Fatship, Catch you next week.
OTHERFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
OTHERFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! MINDY: Mork, what's that? It's a scrapbook, so I can take back memories from the planet Earth.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's really nice.
LEADMALE:A scrapbook of Earth.
SUPMALE:Uh, what are you putting in there? Flags of different countries, pictures of our world leaders? Hey, save it for the Republicans, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Eisenhower.
LEADMALE:I'm going to put some real fun stuff in here.
SUPMALE:Something for the real people, some big yuks.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this.
LEADMALE:An example of some of your Earth poetry.
SUPFEMALE:Huh, let's see.
OTHERMALE:"There once was a girl from Dundee, who" Where did you get this? From the poetry cubicles down at the basketball arena.
OTHERMALE:You must really love poetry, because they're all lined up to pay a dime to sit down and write poetry.
OTHERFEMALE:I think I'll go read some poetry.
LEADMALE:Look at this here.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Now what is this? What is this? It's a souvenir from a wrestling match.
LEADFEMALE:A wrestling match? When did you ever go to a wrestling match? Well, they have them every weekend down by the lake in those parked cars.
LEADFEMALE:Every time I walked by, one of these came out.
LEADFEMALE:Hi Mindy.
SUPMALE:Hi, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Sally.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Little Jody.
LEADMALE:Wow, he's really gotten big! Yeah, he's my little man, all right.
LEADFEMALE:You don't look like you're made out of snakes and snails and puppy dog tails.
OTHERFEMALE:Is this the person who used to live in your stomach? The former bulge? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he's so tiny.
SUPFEMALE:How did he ever get out of there? Well, I think the doctor helped him out, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:He slipped him a map and a compass and said, "You're on your own, clone.
LEADMALE:Good luck.
SUPFEMALE:" Here, why don't you hold him a while.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, I, I don't speak small.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa! Be careful.
LEADMALE:So, what can I help you with? He's so cute.
LEADFEMALE:What do you two talk about when you're alone? Well, nothing yet.
LEADFEMALE:Jody can't talk.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, a little mute.
LEADMALE:It's okay.
LEADMALE:My name is Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:In a couple of months, he'll be chattering like crazy.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, I'll have the fun of teaching him new words.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, you shouldn't teach him new words.
LEADMALE:You should use the old words like everyone else uses, or else they'll think he's an idiot.
LEADFEMALE:I know about that, boy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's good advice, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and I'll teach him to eat by himself, and walk.
SUPMALE:He's got a lot to learn.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, look, I taught him how to hug.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just take these two.
SUPMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he's really incredible.
LEADMALE:Mindy, can we get one? Can we order one today? How about it? Hmm? Can we get one, hmm? He's fantastic.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe we can send away for one.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe you and Mindy ought to get together sometime, and talk.
LEADFEMALE:No matchmaking, Sally.
LEADMALE:Who, me? Hey, don't suck on that.
SUPMALE:You don't know where it's been.
SUPFEMALE:That's fantastic.
LEADMALE:He doesn't have any teeth! Who's the father, Leon Spinks? Come on, Jody.
OTHERMALE:You've got to be real careful.
SUPMALE:He's real tiny, and he's fragile, you know? You might hurt him some way.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:You probably know that, don't you? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:I'll treat him just as if he were my own son.
LEADFEMALE:Here you go.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks Take care.
LEADMALE:We'll have to get together soon.
LEADMALE:Yeah, good.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot.
SUPMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:Take care, little fella.
LEADMALE:There's no place to grow but up! Wasn't he cute? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:For a guy who doesn't move very much, he sure sweats a lot.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I think he likes me a lot.
LEADFEMALE:You know how I can tell? How? 'Cause when I was hugging him, he made a little noise like this Eh! What does that mean? Oh, Mork, that was just a little You're right.
SUPMALE:That was his way of telling you that he likes you.
LEADMALE:Oh, I knew it.
LEADMALE:Kids are such a gas.
LEADMALE:I wish I had one of my own.
LEADMALE:Can men have babies, too? Well, they can help.
LEADFEMALE:It's sort of like a union.
LEADMALE:Oh, you mean, like the Teamsters.
LEADFEMALE:Mm, well it's not exactly like the Oh, sure, I hear about women in labor all the time.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's not done like that.
SUPMALE:How do you do it? Uh, why don't you ask my father? He's real good at things like this.
LEADFEMALE:I have to go back here and work on something.
LEADFEMALE:You're going to have to confront the situation someday.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, how do they do it? Uh, how do who do what? How do they, how do they make babies? Like, I know where they come from.
LEADFEMALE:I'm no pinhead, but how do they get them in? Do they blow them up? Do they add water? What happens? What do they do? Uh, well Mork, how a baby is born isn't as important as the miracle of creation.
SUPMALE:You don't know either, do you? Well, it's been a long time since Mindy was born.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:She must have been a lot of fun to hold.
LEADMALE:She sure is now.
LEADMALE:She was wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:I can't tell you what it's like to have a little, helpless baby completely dependent upon you.
OTHERMALE:I've never had anything dependent upon me.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, don't worry, someday you'll have a child or something of your own.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:I can't wait.
LEADMALE:Boy, I'm headed back now.
LEADMALE:Mindy, I'll catch you back at the apartment.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, sir, she's my baby, no, sir ( knocking ) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

LEADMALE:Yes, sir, glad to see you in here.
LEADMALE:Friend, uh, you don't know me Oh, yes I do.
SUPFEMALE:I saw you in the music store, then you followed me to the grocery store.
LEADMALE:Glad to see you here once again.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Now, when I was in that music store, I couldn't help but notice that you were really enjoying holding that small baby.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:I never held one before, and I really liked it.
LEADMALE:And didn't I hear you say you'd like one of your own? Yeah, but it's physically impossible, you know? I don't have a test tube.
LEADFEMALE:But I'd give anything to have one.
SUPMALE:Would you give $10,000? Hey! What? You see, I know this couple with a baby, and they're trying to find a real nice home for it, you understand? If I don't give you the money, they're going to turn it out, into the woods, and it'll be raised by rabbits? Whatever you say, buddy.
LEADMALE:Oh, I can't let that happen.
OTHERMALE:He might never take care of himself, and he might get a little fur ball caught in his throat.
SUPMALE:Or worse unless you take care of it.
SUPFEMALE:Of course, that's, uh, that's up to you.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do anything you want.
SUPMALE:I'll get the money for you.
SUPMALE:You got yourself a deal.
SUPMALE:Fantastic.
LEADFEMALE:I'll, uh, I'll call you in the morning, all right? Oh, and, uh, one thing, don't breathe a word of this to anyone.
OTHERMALE:Anyone.
OTHERMALE:Whew.
SUPMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:But I have to borrow money from somebody.
LEADFEMALE:What do I tell them? That's your problem, kid.
LEADFEMALE:My, uh, my friends don't like publicity.
LEADMALE:Remember, one word, no deal.
SUPMALE:No pressure.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess I better do this to save the kid.
LEADMALE:And, besides, I'm going to be a father.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be able to teach him to walk, to talk, maybe to fly an egg.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I'll, I'll be in touch.
LEADFEMALE:Take care.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, greasy.
LEADMALE:I'm going to have a baby! Kay-o, Jose! Oh, I feel kind of strange, kind of dizzy.
LEADMALE:I feel a sudden craving for pickles and ice cream.
LEADMALE:Mindy! Sweetheart, darling.
LEADFEMALE:Long time no see, honeybunch.
LEADFEMALE:Dynamic to see you again, darling.
SUPFEMALE:Can I, can I ask you just a small favor? What? Can I have $10,000? No.
LEADMALE:Why not? I really need it.
SUPMALE:I got to have it, please, please, please, please? Now, what could you possibly need that costs $10,000? Um, socks.
LEADMALE:Socks.
LEADMALE:Gucci socks.
LEADMALE:$10,000 worth of Gucci socks? Well, that's four pair and a garter.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen Mork, I'd really like to help you out, but I don't have that kind of money.
SUPFEMALE:What kind do you have? I have the kind that jingles.
LEADFEMALE:You know, the kind you use in gum machines.
SUPMALE:Oh, humor.
LEADFEMALE:( honking bark ) What do you need $10,000 for, anyway? Oh, it's for a big surprise.
LEADMALE:It's real expensive, but I know you'll love it.
SUPMALE:Uh, you're not going to help me? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:What can I do to get $10,000? I can always go to Jesus.
SUPMALE:That'll cost me an arm and a broken leg.
LEADFEMALE:I know, you can try selling apples.
OTHERMALE:That's right! Apples! Let's see, at a nickel apiece that's 20,000 apples, No.
SUPFEMALE:We can sell one big apple on steroids for $10,000.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait, I can baby-sit for mainland China.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:I could teach etiquette to Billy Carter! No! I could sell dental floss to the Osmonds! Listen, you think of something.
SUPMALE:I'm going to go in the bedroom right now and change my clothes, but I will be back to discuss this with you later.
LEADMALE:I'll be your valet for $2,000.
LEADMALE:Well, in case I do get the money, I better practice being a father.
LEADMALE:Eh, here's my little surrogate baby.
LEADMALE:Here we go.
SUPMALE:Yay.
LEADMALE:Finkundoo hatchling, finkundoo fee Finkundoo hatchling, finkundoo Oh, fantastic, I love you so.
OTHERFEMALE:Why didn't you tell me you had to do that? Excuse me, ladies.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:May I show you some disco records? No, thanks.
LEADMALE:I'm with the F.
OTHERMALE:B.
LEADFEMALE:I.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Well, maybe I can show you some Police records.
SUPFEMALE:( laughs ) Can I help you? Yes, I'd like you to look at this photograph and tell me if you've ever seen this man before.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:This guy was hanging around here yesterday.
LEADMALE:Who is he? He's a creep who kidnaps and sells babies.
LEADMALE:We were tailing him yesterday when he followed a woman with a baby into this store.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my God, that was Sally! Is he after her baby? He could be, but don't worry.
SUPMALE:We're watching him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank goodness.
SUPMALE:The odd thing is, when he left here, he didn't follow her.
LEADMALE:He followed some strange-looking man with suspenders to your house, Miss McConnell.
LEADMALE:To my house? What would he be doing at my house? That's what we want to ask you.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, does a strange man with suspenders give you a clue? Oh, Dad, Mork wouldn't do anything wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:How much does this guy sell babies for? $10,000.
LEADMALE:Well, what I meant was, Mork wouldn't do anything wrong intentionally.
LEADFEMALE:Ma'am, if you think your friend is trying to buy a baby, relax.
SUPMALE:He's not in trouble.
OTHERFEMALE:We want the kidnapper.
SUPMALE:You wouldn't arrest him? Absolutely not.
LEADMALE:Well, then I think my friend Mork might be trying to buy a baby.
SUPFEMALE:Yesterday, when I came home from work he asked me if he could borrow $10,000.
OTHERMALE:Did you give it to him? No, I don't have that kind of money! Well, you do now.
LEADMALE:Oh, I don't know about this.
SUPFEMALE:Miss McConnell, we must have your help.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess if the guy is such a creep, I guess Mork would want to help, too.
SUPMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:You can't tell him.
OTHERFEMALE:This guy is sharp, and if he thinks he's being set up, we'll lose him again.
SUPFEMALE:He's right, dear.
SUPFEMALE:Mork is no actor.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I want you to call me the minute you know when and where the transfer is being made.
SUPFEMALE:Good day.
OTHERFEMALE:This is the famous Orkan atom smasher! Let me show you how this works.
OTHERFEMALE:First, get one government atom ( makes squeaking sound ) There's one put it under there ( groans) Flatto! I'll clean up that mess later, but actually if we'd split the atom we'd all be dead meat by now, but let's move on quickly.
LEADMALE:It can also crush nuts.
SUPMALE:See the nut? I see the nut.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Mork, I've got the money you need.
SUPFEMALE:$10,000.

LEADMALE:You see, I made this for my favorite TV star ( as Tattoo ): Boss, my shirt has landed.
LEADFEMALE:( with Latin accent ): Give it to me, Tattoo, I want to wear it that's my fantasy.
LEADFEMALE:Um Look at that look at that ring, isn't it amazing? Look at the size of that sucker, boy.
LEADMALE:I bet Elizabeth Taylor doesn't even have one of these.
SUPFEMALE:No, she doesn't.
LEADMALE:( rattling ) It's uh a seeing eye rattle for a blind snake.
LEADMALE:( phone ringing ) Saved by the bell.
LEADFEMALE:Telephone.

LEADFEMALE:Boy, that'd be funny, wouldn't it? Whoa.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, should be coming through anytime now, you know.
LEADMALE:A little guy, so helpless, so tiny.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I'm here to take care of him.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm the father figure.
SUPMALE:Yeah, he's only six months old and I haven't seen him in two years.
LEADMALE:Called me up the other day on the phone.
LEADMALE:Kind of a strange conversation.
SUPMALE:All he knows is ( making baby sounds ) How he got his little fingers in the dial, I'll never know.
SUPFEMALE:So I says to him Boy, you're about as much fun as I guess the firstborn means a lot to a father.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I'm going to be.
SUPMALE:Whew.
SUPMALE:Here's my man now.
SUPFEMALE:I'm over here! I'm over here! Don't you know what's happening here? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm going to give you $10,000 and you're going to give me a baby.
LEADFEMALE:Would you shut up? You'll wake up the baby.
LEADMALE:Now, where's the money? Here it is.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Easy.
LEADMALE:I want to make sure it's all here.
SUPMALE:Okay, here's your kid.
LEADFEMALE:MORK: Oh.
OTHERMALE:Hold it, scuz! I want to make sure he's all here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, he's all there, but I'm not so sure about you.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:It's been a pleasure dealing with a Stetson stork.
OTHERFEMALE:Passengers are now disembarking from Aspen and Vale.
LEADFEMALE:You're under arrest.
SUPFEMALE:Up against the wall.
LEADFEMALE:Attention Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Dan Benton, please report to the desk.
SUPMALE:Hands behind your back.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm telling you, you got the wrong guy.
LEADFEMALE:Sure we do.
LEADMALE:You are Chuck Wilson, alias Chuck Martin, alias Charles Henthorne.
LEADMALE:See? You don't know who you got.
LEADFEMALE:We got you this time.
LEADFEMALE:This money is marked.
OTHERMALE:Take him out to the car and read him his rights.
LEADMALE:Well let's get the baby and take him back to his parents.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:He's gone! He must have slipped out the back.
OTHERMALE:Well don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure he's going back to Miss McConnell's house.
LEADFEMALE:I better get her on the phone at the store.
LEADFEMALE:and the beautiful princess said, "If I kiss you, will you buy me a Halston dress and take me to Long Island and build me a condominium?" And the jive toad said, "Sho, mama, anything you want.
LEADMALE:" And so, the princess kissed the ugly toad, and lo and behold, she croaked.
LEADFEMALE:She keeled right over.
SUPFEMALE:Splat.
SUPMALE:And her little tiny crown rolled down the hill, because the toad was wearing poisoned lip gloss.
OTHERMALE:Here's the moral of the story never kiss a toad in drag.
OTHERFEMALE:There we go It's time for us to get rocking, here.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:Oh let's get down, get funky.
SUPMALE:There we go.
LEADMALE:There we go Finkundoo hatchling dee bo klaykoo Bon de dan derso you're waiting too ( gurgles ) Boy, I'm so proud to be a father.
LEADFEMALE:I can't wait for you to meet your God-moose, too.
LEADMALE:I'm a father, here Chuck, here's a cigar.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Carl.
LEADMALE:Mindy, Mindy, look, I'm a father.
LEADFEMALE:You'll never believe what happened.
LEADMALE:All of a sudden, this little guy followed me all the way home, and all of a sudden I heard a little tiny knock at the door ( makes squeaking sound ) and he crawled right in, you know.
LEADFEMALE:That's fantastic! Mork Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Here's what really happened.
SUPMALE:I was walking down the street, and I saw these bullrushes, and there was a burning bush you know? And all of a sudden this big voice said, "Take him home, it'll be all right.
SUPFEMALE:" Mork I know, oh dopey me.
OTHERMALE:I should never get my alibis out of a best-seller.
LEADMALE:Um here's the truth, this is what really happened you see, his parents abandoned him and they'd leave him in the woods and he'd be raised by rabbits and who knows what would happen when hunting season would come along? He might end up on a little chain as a good luck charm, you know what I mean? Mork Mindy, please! See, he's fantastic, and I'll be a great father.
LEADMALE:I'll love him, I'll care for him, I'll feed him, I'll do everything he needs, and besides I named him after you.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mork, you're not making this easy at all.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to make it easy for you.
SUPMALE:He's fantastic.
LEADFEMALE:You can't send him Mork, you can't keep him.
OTHERMALE:Why not? I paid good money for him.
LEADFEMALE:Well that's just it, it's against the law to buy a baby.
SUPFEMALE:No it isn't, the guy who sold him to me says he sells them all the time.
OTHERMALE:That's right, and he's going to jail because of that.
LEADFEMALE:Are they here to take him back? I'm afraid they are.
SUPMALE:But don't you understand? His parents were mean, nasty people.
OTHERMALE:That guy lied to you, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:This baby was stolen.
OTHERMALE:His parents love him very much, and they want him back desperately.
OTHERMALE:All right, you get the baby, and I'll contact the office.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:( gurgling ) I'll give him back to you.
LEADMALE:Shh, shh.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:You've got to keep him real dry, because he's kind of like a dribble glass with arms.
LEADMALE:And, oh, you've got to keep him real warm, too.
LEADMALE:Got to keep him wrapped up real tight.
LEADFEMALE:And if he ever makes a noise like this ( burping sound ) that means he likes you.
LEADFEMALE:Take care, little fella.
SUPFEMALE:Good-bye, little Mindy.
SUPMALE:Top of the world, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Miss McConnell, Thank you.
LEADMALE:We'll be in touch.
OTHERMALE:I'm going to miss him.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, I'm so sorry things worked out like this.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, me, too.
SUPMALE:I feel so bad.
SUPFEMALE:You understand I had to do that, I had to give him to those people.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I didn't know his parents loved him so much and wanted him back.
SUPMALE:I can't blame them.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what to say.
SUPFEMALE:I just feel so sorry for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you don't have to feel sorry for me.
OTHERFEMALE:Now I know what it's like to be a father.
SUPFEMALE:It's really wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:Even being a father for an hour is better than being never a father at all.
LEADFEMALE:You're really amazing.
LEADMALE:And besides, I would have made a lousy father.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't even get the kid to eat.
LEADMALE:Mork, calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, laser breath.
LEADMALE:Mork, calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork, calling Orson ORSON: I read you, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:What have you got for me this week? Oh, something very special, Your Immenseness.
LEADMALE:This week, I was a father for an hour.
OTHERFEMALE:That's wonderful.
OTHERMALE:What's a father? Oh, you remember a mother? Well a father is the male counterpart.
LEADMALE:If you have a mother, why do you need a father? Sounds like featherbedding to me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:A father's very important.
LEADMALE:He gives the child love.
OTHERMALE:You told me that's what the mother did.
LEADMALE:Oh, but a child needs lots of love so he can grow big and strong in here.
LEADFEMALE:That's a father's whole function? No.
LEADFEMALE:Just loving? Oh, no, Your Fattitude.
LEADMALE:You see, a father serves another purpose, too.
LEADMALE:He provides food, shelter, leadership, and according to recent facts, he works very hard, worries a lot, and dies young so his family can go on living.
LEADFEMALE:Who would apply for a job like that? You know, between the mother and the father, children receive so much of everything, they must be grateful.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, sir, you see, they take it for granted, until it's gone.
LEADMALE:Then they miss it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't understand why anybody would want to be a parent.
OTHERMALE:Orson, it's one of those situations where you have to be there.
LEADFEMALE:Because once you hold this, this little, tiny baby in your arms, this eensy, teensy tiny being ( makes baby sounds ) it makes it all worthwhile.
LEADMALE:Personally, I'll stick with the test tubes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, que sera sera.
SUPFEMALE:Until next week, Your Immenseness Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:Andiamo.
SUPMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! Oh, Friday night? Oh, I can't, Sally, it's my birthday.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm already spending it with somebody.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, it's somebody pretty special.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, good.
SUPFEMALE:All right, I'll talk to you soon.
OTHERMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:You're spending your birthday with somebody special? Yeah Let me guess.
LEADFEMALE:Menachem Begin? No.
LEADMALE:Jimmy Carter.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Frank Zappa.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Pope John Paul.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I'm planning on spending my birthday with you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, heavy sigh.
LEADMALE:Another lonely night again for the Pope polishing those little red shoes.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, we'll go someplace really nice for dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll laugh and celebrate and have a really good time.
LEADMALE:How's that sound? Rotten.
LEADMALE:Rotten? Why? Don't you want to be with me on my birthday? Oh, positively, but, see, something happened last night that's going to affect the rest of my life, if I live that long.
SUPFEMALE:What? Oh, last night when I was sleeping I had little talking pictures in my head.
LEADMALE:Oh, you mean you had a dream? Oh, I know it wasn't a movie 'cause when I woke up, there was no gum under my seat.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know if it was a dream or not.
LEADMALE:All I know is it was terrifying, and you were in it, too.
LEADMALE:Me? What did I do? Don't play dumb! We started off first by going to this human car-wash and being covered in Shake and Bake.
SUPMALE:And the entire cast of The Untouchables was there, too.
SUPMALE:And then we ended up in this big hot tub where we played "Connect the Dot" with each other's freckles and bobbed for wet things.
LEADMALE:And then, suddenly, you were in another man's arms! Exit grief, enter rage! And as he turned around horror! It was me! And I started carrying on like I wasn't even there.
SUPFEMALE:How could I do this to me? Good old grief, then jealousy! I started slapping myself around, hitting myself all over the place.
SUPMALE:And there was a little man in the background going "Don't worry, it'll be cute.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:" And then, as I started fighting and fighting among myself, fighting among myself, you said, "That's all right, stop! Stop, I'll choose between you!" Mindy, my whole emotional life is passing before me.
LEADMALE:Mork, don't worry.
LEADMALE:All you had was a bad dream.
SUPFEMALE:People have them all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, don't you understand? See, Orkans don't have dreams.
LEADFEMALE:We cut them off bleems ago when we cut off our emotions.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you claim that Orkans have no emotions, and yet you show them all the time.
OTHERFEMALE:Watch your mouth! You do, face it.
LEADMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:Sometimes I do get an occasional pleasure out of flashing them in the raincoat of my mind.
LEADFEMALE:But now it's different.
LEADFEMALE:They've crept into my subconscious, and they Well, last night they snuck out and they had a good old time.
LEADFEMALE:They used me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I feel so cheap and dirty.
OTHERFEMALE:They'll probably never even call me in the city.
OTHERMALE:But, Mork, showing emotions is healthy.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:But Mindy, that's a no-no no-no for a nanu-nanu.
OTHERFEMALE:Mindy, I've made a decision, and I don't think you're going to like it very much.
LEADMALE:What is it? Well, I've got to stop this before they take me completely over, so I've got this little door in the back of my mind, I'm going to round up all my emotions, put them behind that door, lock it, and hide the key in my foot.
OTHERMALE:Are you saying that you won't feel anything anymore? Right on.
LEADMALE:Strike up the bland.
LEADFEMALE:Good-bye, Mindy, I'm closing off my emotions forever.
SUPMALE:( makes humming sound ) Wait a minute, Mork! Don't! You can't do this to yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, don't you understand? These emotions have been locked up for thousands and thousands of bleems.
LEADFEMALE:If they get out, they'll be dangerous.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know what'll happen.
LEADFEMALE:Talk about your sailors on leave.
LEADMALE:Mork, if you study human beings, you'll find out that we can't get along without emotions.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I've studied them.
SUPMALE:World War I, World War II, Watergate.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then study them closer at work.
SUPMALE:I mean, people can't get along without emotions.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, after all, it's what sets us apart from the animals.
OTHERFEMALE:But, you see, on Ork only animals have emotions.
SUPFEMALE:And that's the way it should be, according to Prime Minister Fluffy.
SUPMALE:CORA: What's the matter, Eugene? My pet lizard Herbie died.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that is too bad.
SUPMALE:I don't what happened to him.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe he ate a rancid fly.
LEADMALE:I'm really feeling down.
OTHERMALE:Well, maybe it would help if you cried.
OTHERMALE:No way.
SUPFEMALE:My dad says big boys never cry.
LEADMALE:Oh, interesting; not showing emotion.
SUPFEMALE:Come along, Eugene.
LEADFEMALE:He does cry.
OTHERFEMALE:I've seen him.
LEADFEMALE:Recently? No, not recently.
SUPFEMALE:Aha! Hi, toots.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Uh, what can I do for you? Caress me with your eyes.
OTHERFEMALE:Say, uh, have you got any disco records? Yes, we do, right over here.
LEADFEMALE:This is the disco section.
SUPMALE:I love to hear my chains rattle.
LEADMALE:Say have you got Night Fever by the GeeBees? Excuse me, I have to go somewhere.
SUPMALE:Mork, help me out.
SUPFEMALE:Will you go will you go wait on that guy? Why? What's wrong? Well, he's got on this ridiculous toupee, and I'm afraid I'm going to laugh in his face, please.
SUPMALE:Well, you're hiding your emotions.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you told me laughing was good.
OTHERFEMALE:Laughing is good, but in this case I might hurt the guy's feelings.
SUPFEMALE:Pishtosh! I'm sure he'd be glad to know his hair brings joy to the world.
LEADMALE:Watch this.
SUPMALE:I'll handle it.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, sir.
SUPMALE:Oh, hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Groovy.
LEADFEMALE:Did you know you bring joy to the world? Yeah, it's my natural charisma.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, it's that silly hair.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? Well, I've seen wavy hair before, but never hair waving.
LEADMALE:Look at that! ( gasps ) Wait, wait, wait! Well, hair today, gone tomorrow.
LEADMALE:MINDY: Mork, people really need their emotions.
OTHERMALE:It's not the same thing, anyway.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Mork, I don't care what you say.
OTHERMALE:You can't shut off your emotions.
LEADMALE:Well, you haven't convinced me that I need them.
SUPMALE:So on behalf of my emotions, I'd just like to say good-bye, sayonara, ciao, ta-ta, catch you later, mama, and shalom.
LEADMALE:It's been nice feeling you.
LEADMALE:( makes whirring sound ) Wait a minute, Mork, don't! Come on, don't.
LEADFEMALE:( monotone ): It's too late.
LEADFEMALE:The door is locked.
LEADMALE:My emotions are shut off forever.
LEADMALE:And so's the Mork that I like so well.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:We can go on having the non-emotional equivalent of fun.
SUPMALE:There are certain advantages.
LEADFEMALE:Watch.
OTHERFEMALE:Didn't that hurt? You bet.
OTHERMALE:Ow, it's killing me.
SUPMALE:So, what's the advantage of that? I can hurt myself all day without bothering other people.
LEADMALE:Mork, that door in your head, can that ever be re-opened? Yes, but I can't do it, because what's behind there is far too dangerous.
LEADMALE:You know something? You are really dumb.
LEADFEMALE:Nice try, but insults to a man with no emotions is like hay fever to a man with no nose.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, I hate you like this.
SUPMALE:I mean, you're ruining my birthday.
LEADFEMALE:Another nice attempt for an Earthling, but no match for the incredible hulking will of an Orkan.
LEADFEMALE:Darn it, Mork, open that door! I hear you knocking, but you can't come in.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you were such a terrific guy the way you were.
LEADMALE:I mean, you were so, you were so much fun to be with, and now look at you.
OTHERFEMALE:You're, you're unemotional, you're cold.
SUPFEMALE:It feels like part of you has died.
LEADMALE:If you think you can get to me by crying, you're wrong.
SUPMALE:( normal voice ): Mindy, it ( monotone ): Fall back, mayday, system to be defense line "B", shore up defenses, sandbag tear ducts, think baseball, baseball.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, once again I'm in control.
LEADFEMALE:No problem.
LEADMALE:I can deal with you as any other person with invitingly soft skin rosebud lips and sweet little eyes that leak cute little drops that roll gently down your cheeks.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm getting to you, aren't I? Not this fella.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Morky, open up the door.
LEADMALE:Why don't you show Mindy where you tucked away all those little emotions, hmm? Mayday, mayday, mayday! All systems overload, fall back, defense line "B", prepare for assault system! You show me yours, I'll show you mine.
SUPMALE:Never, never! The door! It's breaking, the door is Mindy, run for your life, the emotions are coming! Aha, free at last! All you emotions, follow me! ( laughing maniacally ) Mork, don't! Mindy! What are you doing? I'm not Mork.
SUPMALE:I'm Mork's Lust.
SUPFEMALE:Come on now, girlie girl.
OTHERMALE:I saw her first! Get away from her, Jealousy.
OTHERFEMALE:What the hell are you doing?! ( scattered mumbling ) Don't hurt him.
SUPMALE:He has a right Okay, please, okay! Mama All of you emotions, come on! We've got a lot of catching up to do! Let's go, boys! Yeah! Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, help! It just doesn't seem possible that emotions could so change a person.
SUPMALE:Well, it's all my fault.
LEADMALE:I kissed him, and bingo.
SUPFEMALE:Well, at least, dear, you got a kiss.
LEADFEMALE:When I go out with a man, it's usually just for Bingo.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess that's what happens when you bottle up your emotions for so many years.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, don't blame yourself.
LEADMALE:You were only trying to help Mork be like other human beings.
LEADMALE:Well, excuse me! Why don't you ever sell any of this stuff?! What's wrong? Oh, Mindy, that wasn't me, that was Anger.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what happened to your other emotions? I think they're sleeping it off in my mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, it's been a hard day's night, I can't tell you.
LEADMALE:I'd lock them all up behind there except Anger's standing guard.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, and I'm a big boy, too! And don't mess with me! Oh, get off! It's okay now.
LEADMALE:See? Where have you been? Don't ask.
LEADMALE:I've done things that would embarrass Idi Amin.
LEADFEMALE:Like what? Well, we started off by going to the waterfront.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:There's no waterfront in Colorado.
SUPMALE:Who says we stayed in Colorado? Here's some shells.
LEADMALE:We started off by going to this really cheap dive called The Ballpark.
SUPMALE:Fear didn't want to go in, but Disgust called him a sissy.
SUPFEMALE:And Excitement was so titillated by that he went to the bar and ordered ten beers, one for each finger.
LEADMALE:Guilt felt so bad about that he yanked us in the alley.
OTHERMALE:Whimsy said it must be named Mohammed.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up! Let me finish the story! Suddenly, we were surrounded by a vicious motorcycle gang.
LEADFEMALE:There were 12 of us against 42 of them.
LEADMALE:Anger is still spitting leather.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, whatever happened to the positive emotions like Love? Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:I don't know what I said to that girl on the street corner.
SUPFEMALE:All I remember is that she sold her car and gave all the money to me.
LEADMALE:Well, at least you seem all right now.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but that's just for the moment.
SUPMALE:Who knows when they'll come out again, anytime Yeah! See? I can't go to your birthday party, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:It'll ruin the birthday for you.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, the only thing that would ruin my birthday is if you're not there.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a heck of a guy.
SUPFEMALE:What's that? Oh, Grandma made me this for my birthday.
SUPMALE:Isn't it nice? Yeah, I knitted it myself.
SUPMALE:It took me five weeks.
LEADMALE:Five weeks? Hah! What did you use for knitting needles, crowbars? Uh, I think my emotions are waking up again.
LEADFEMALE:I noticed.
SUPMALE:Unfortunately, they're coming out at the wrong times, aren't they? Yeah, I think they're trying to get out and teach me a lesson and show me who's boss.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs crazily ) Not now! It's okay.
LEADFEMALE:See? I hope I don't embarrass you tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, I got you into this, and we're going to work this out together, okay? Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:That felt real nice.
LEADFEMALE:Now see? See how nice emotions can be when they start behaving themselves? Yes, that was fantastic.
LEADMALE:That was terrific Come on, mama, lay another wet one on me! Come on! Good evening.
LEADMALE:Good evening.
LEADFEMALE:May I, uh, help you? Yes, we have reservations for two under the name of McConnell for 8:00.
LEADMALE:Very well, I'll just check my list.
LEADMALE:( clears throat ) There must be some mistake, there's no McConnell anywhere on this list.
OTHERFEMALE:But I made the reservations two days ago.
LEADMALE:Tonight's my birthday, it's a special occasion.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Well, you'll just have to try us on another special occasion.
LEADMALE:( shouting ): Maybe you didn't hear the girl! How about you gettin' her a table right now or I'll tear off your lips, paste them to your eyes, so you can see what you're going to say, how about that, Huh? Get us a table right now! Haul it, haul it now! Uh, yes, sir, yes, sir.
LEADMALE:I'll, uh Here we are, sir.
OTHERMALE:Uh, this one just became available.
LEADMALE:This is nice, but it's awfully close to the kitchen.
LEADMALE:Well, it guarantees your food will arrive piping hot.
LEADFEMALE:I just can't sit next to the kitchen with all that, that clattering and gibberish and foreign tongues.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, oy vey, Maria, this is ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:And if I sit by this tacky swinging door and catch a disease, I'll sue you silly, I will.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God, I'm hypoglycemic.
LEADFEMALE:Here I go.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, uh, right this way, please.
SUPMALE:Here we are, this is uh, Chez Michel's finest table.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's wonderful.
SUPMALE:It's more than that, it's delightful, it's de-lovely, it's delicious.
LEADMALE:Thank you, thank you.
LEADMALE:This is fantastic! Thank you, thank you! Oh, sell my clothes, I'm going to heaven.
LEADFEMALE:And we hope you have a safe and speedy trip.
OTHERFEMALE:( clears throat ) Nanu-nanu.
SUPMALE:I didn't know my emotions could work so well for me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, yeah, they're real nice, Mork, but I still think they're coming out a little too strong.
LEADMALE:Oh, but if it wasn't for them, we'd be celebrating your birthday at Biffy Burger.
LEADMALE:Bon soir, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
LEADMALE:Might I recommend the chateaubriand with sauce Michel and carrots glace.
SUPMALE:And to begin, salad endive with dressing Polonaise.
LEADMALE:Ooh, that sounds terrific.
LEADMALE:Very well, Mademoiselle.
SUPMALE:Oh, by the way, do you have Thousand Island dressing? It's my favorite.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so sorry, we do not carry Thousand Island dressing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's too bad, No Thousand Island dressing? Oh, please, those are her favorite little islands.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this is terrible, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mindy, I-I can't go on! Mindy, I can't go on! It's terrible.
LEADMALE:Please, please, please.
OTHERMALE:Tell him I'll get some from the 7-Eleven.
SUPFEMALE:And if you need anything else, my name is, Butch.
OTHERFEMALE:Hang in there, Mork, you're doing okay.
OTHERMALE:Well, I owe it all to you, Mindy.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Ooh, will you look over there? Look at that lobster! Doesn't that look fabulous? Oh, now I wish I'd ordered that.
OTHERMALE:( with Milquetoast voice ): Yeah, me, too.
LEADFEMALE:I wish we could have things like that.
SUPFEMALE:I never have anything any good.
OTHERMALE:( with assertive voice ): Yeah, because you're so damn wimpy, that's why! Why don't you get it for me? All right, I'll get it for you! Come on, we got to change this world No problem.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me! You've been on top long enough! Give me that, you bourgeoisie pigs! Give me that here! You won't need that thing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look, what a way to end a honeymoon.
OTHERFEMALE:Poor little creatures.
OTHERMALE:Mork, I'm worried about you.
LEADMALE:Unless you get these emotions under control, you're going to be scooped up by a net.
SUPMALE:Well, Frankie Avalon didn't mind in all those movies where he was scooped up by Annette.
LEADMALE:( honking bark ) You know, it puzzles me I don't understand why you continue to view your emotions as if they're alien creatures.
SUPFEMALE:They're a part of you, you know.
LEADMALE:Haven't you ever just thought about sitting down and talking to them? They wouldn't talk to me.
LEADMALE:Well, do you think they'd talk to me? Call them out and let me try.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're a brave woman.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you sure? All right.
SUPFEMALE:Yoo-hoo, anybody home? Olly, olly Freud's in free.
LEADMALE:First one home is an archetype.
SUPFEMALE:( gruff Southern accent ): Yeah, what do you want? Now, I'm not going to know who you are unless you identify yourselves.
LEADFEMALE:Anger, here, fly brain! Mork just wants to try and get along with all of you better.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you just tell Mork to ( blows raspberry ) Now, I don't know how things got the way they-they are on Ork, but here on Earth a person needs his emotions.
LEADFEMALE:( Milquetoast voice ): Disappointment here.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I hate, I hate to bother you, but things, things aren't the way we thought, you know? I mean, it's not like home.
SUPMALE:I mean, the trees are green, the birds have wings, it's bizarre.
SUPMALE:It really ( as Peter Lorre ): Fear here.
LEADMALE:Uh, I don't want to tell you this, but, you know, it's cold and lonely and no one likes us, and no one hears the voices like we do, and they're going to hurt us, I know they are.
LEADFEMALE:Please, don't you understand me? Oh, no, nobody's going to hurt you.
SUPMALE:Don't you understand you're free on Earth.
LEADMALE:You can do anything you want.
SUPFEMALE:Disgust here.
LEADMALE:Now, listen, we've done our gig and you don't even like it when we do.
LEADMALE:Listen, I'm going to blow this Popsicle stand.
SUPMALE:Besides, who wants to live in a house that looks like Sears blew up.
LEADMALE:Really.
LEADMALE:I mean ( with confident voice ): Hope here.
LEADFEMALE:I just want to say Thanks for the memories.
LEADFEMALE:But don't you see, Mork needs to work with all of you to be a feeling person.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Mindy's right, you guys.
LEADFEMALE:How about it? I'll make you a deal.
LEADFEMALE:Tell you what you don't go wild, and I won't lock you up inside my brain, okay? ANGER: Yeah, what's in it for us, pork face? All right, you said you're lonely? FEAR: Oh, yes, please, we're so lonely.
SUPMALE:You got to do something.
SUPFEMALE:All right, I'll make you a deal.

LEADMALE:I understand.
LEADFEMALE:But I don't regret what I've done, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:You see, for the first time in my life I feel really alive, I feel fantastic.
LEADMALE:Oh, I wish you could try it.
LEADFEMALE:I wish you could feel some of the things I've been feeling.
LEADFEMALE:Impossible.
LEADMALE:I could never do that.
LEADMALE:They'd throw me in prison.
LEADFEMALE:I don't mean to be disrespectful, Your Immenseness, but, until you can marvel at a rainbow after a storm, or rejoice at seeing a baby walk for the first time, or hold someone, and feel the same warmth inside as you feel close to them on the outside, until you can do these things aren't you already in prison? Uh, when will you report me, sir? Report you? What for? Whew! Ha! You're all right, Your Fattitude! Until next week, nanu-nanu.
SUPMALE:I knew he had it in him.
LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.

LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Oh, hello, dear.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you ready? Well, I want you to know that I am not looking forward to this weekend.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm with you.
SUPMALE:I'd rather have my nose pierced.
LEADMALE:I agree, but it's an obligation.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, I haven't even told Mork yet.
LEADMALE:I feel so bad about running off and leaving him stranded for the whole weekend.
LEADMALE:It's a long way to Alpha Centauri ( loud beep ) Yep.
SUPMALE:It's me, the Doug Henning of the skycaps.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:Let's take off.
SUPFEMALE:Let's move it.
SUPFEMALE:Come on now.
LEADMALE:Hit the road, Jack Don't come back no more, no more.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Mork, uh, Durango is a long, unpleasant drive from here.
LEADMALE:Now you don't want to go there, do you? My kind of town Durango is my No, no, Mork, no, it's a windy, twisty, carsicky trip.
LEADFEMALE:You wouldn't like it.
SUPMALE:Are you kidding? I'll love it.
LEADMALE:It's my first car trip here on Earth.
SUPMALE:Please, you know, I stayed up all last night and look, I have my instamatic glove and I have a whole thumb load full of film.
SUPMALE:Since I heard you were taking a trip to Durango last night I'm sorry I eavesdropped, but since Watergate, anything's free.
SUPMALE:Look, I made plans.
SUPFEMALE:I bought these silly clothes.
LEADFEMALE:I even made a map.
OTHERMALE:See this.
SUPFEMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:It's topographical and scratch-and-smell.
SUPFEMALE:There's L.
LEADFEMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE:Whoo, bad news.
SUPFEMALE:Over here look at this.
LEADMALE:We'll start out from Boulder then we'll go a little bit out of the way to the Grand Canyon, ( echoes ): canyon, canyon We'll go over here to New York.
SUPFEMALE:We'll spend autumn in New York.
SUPFEMALE:Then we'll drive over to Paris, spend spring in Paris, watch the leaves change, then we'll go to Iran and watch the governments change.
LEADMALE:Mork.
OTHERMALE:Shah, shah, Ayatollah you so.
LEADMALE:Shah-shah Mork you can't go.
LEADMALE:Do my eyes deceive my ears? Wait, you must be pulling my krebits.
OTHERMALE:Mork, it's a family problem.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Jack is sick.
SUPMALE:A drunken mime? No, believe me, you don't want to go.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Jack is a little strange.
LEADMALE:I've never liked him since he spit on me.
SUPMALE:Why did he do that? Well, it was years ago.
SUPFEMALE:I had his tie.
LEADMALE:What were you doing with his tie? Well, I was pulling it, tighter and tighter.
LEADMALE:I had him a lovely shade of purple.
LEADFEMALE:FRED: He had it coming.
LEADMALE:He was drunk.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:See, it's a sickness and he wants to get better, so he checked himself into a hospital.
SUPFEMALE:His wife asked us to come down and give him a little moral support.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, so now that we've explained, do you understand? Hey, listen, you're talking to Mork the Compassionate.
LEADFEMALE:I was almost a saint.
LEADMALE:Tell you what, we'll leave out the Grand Canyon.
LEADFEMALE:That way, we can be with Uncle Jack by Happy Hour.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you can't go.
SUPFEMALE:Really, it's just a family matter.
LEADMALE:Anyway, he'd be embarrassed to have a perfect stranger see him like this.
LEADFEMALE:That's all right.
OTHERMALE:I'm a sensitive life-form.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not some Venusian paramecium that was evolved yesterday, you know.
OTHERFEMALE:( fake chuckle ) You'll be all right here alone for the weekend, won't you? Sure, sure, why wouldn't I? Well, you haven't been alone for any period of time since you've been here.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mindy, let me lay out some hard, cold facts.
SUPMALE:I'm the type of guy who's my own best friend.
OTHERMALE:I'm interesting, I'm amazing.
OTHERMALE:I can hold interesting conversations even with Tom Snyder.
LEADFEMALE:Are you ever bored when you're alone with me? No, but Neither am I.
SUPMALE:Same guy, same amazing personality.
LEADFEMALE:I think what Mindy's trying to say is, when you get used to being around somebody, it's kind of difficult when they're gone.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, we're not talking a lifetime, we're talking a weekend.
OTHERMALE:Two days.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on now, 48 hours.
LEADFEMALE:Couple of thousand minutes, some seconds there.
LEADMALE:Hey, you know, I know some Alpha Centurians that spend that much time just taking a coffee break.
SUPMALE:Of course, they drink out of hundred-gallon mugs, but You know, I think we really should be going.
LEADMALE:Good-bye, Mork.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you kids get outta here.

LEADMALE:Take care.
LEADMALE:All right, bye.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
OTHERFEMALE:( sighs ) I'm so stinking bored! MORK ( sings ): One more bottle of beer on the wall One more bottle of beer If one of those bottles should happen to fall One more time! A million bottles of beer on the wall A million bottles of beer If one of those I can't sing that song anymore.

LEADFEMALE:I almost know it by heart.
LEADMALE:Let's see how many points.
OTHERMALE:Ah, only two points against me.
OTHERFEMALE:Er She's only been gone 24 hours, and I'm going crazy.

SUPMALE:Susan Taylor's visiting the Broncos.

LEADMALE:Yeah, I thought with a name like Bob Lipschultz you've got to be a fun kind of guy.
LEADFEMALE:Bob, how about you and I getting together? What? Bob? Bad connection.
LEADFEMALE:I guess it just hit me.
OTHERMALE:I didn't realize it till now that I'm a people junkie.
LEADMALE:Need a conversation fix.
LEADFEMALE:Can you spare a word, man? "No, I can't.
SUPFEMALE:" Shut up, give me a chance.

LEADFEMALE:( knocking ) Come in.
LEADFEMALE:Bicky.
SUPMALE:Look at that.
SUPMALE:Wow, parallel universe.
LEADFEMALE:Same thing happened to me.
LEADMALE:You pea-brain.
OTHERFEMALE:What's the big idea of getting that walking tree trunk mad at you? I didn't mean to make him mad at me.
OTHERFEMALE:I just wanted to have a friend.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you're such a babe in the woods.
OTHERMALE:There are certain things you never do in this world if you want to stay in this world.
LEADFEMALE:For example, never gargle with crazy glue.
LEADMALE:( low ): Never gargle with crazy glue.
LEADFEMALE:Never tap-dance in a minefield.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:No "Tea for Two" or ( imitates explosion ) And never chide a man with a tattoo on his face even if he's dead.
LEADFEMALE:No dead tattoos.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't mean to.
LEADMALE:It was just that I was bored and lonely.
SUPFEMALE:Can't you think of a time when you were bored and lonely? I can't think of a time when I wasn't bored.
SUPFEMALE:No, I take that back.
LEADFEMALE:I was once hit by lightning.
SUPFEMALE:I wasn't bored when I was in a coma.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on, things can't always be that bad.
LEADMALE:Sure they can, kid.
OTHERFEMALE:When my wife and I got divorced, part of the settlement was that she got to keep our friends.
OTHERMALE:We'll make new friends for you.
LEADMALE:Tell you what.
LEADMALE:We'll go out tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll have a swell time.
LEADMALE:We'll paint the town pink.

SUPFEMALE:A movie? Out of the question.
SUPMALE:I never go any place where my feet stick to the floor.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Here are some self-improvement courses.
OTHERMALE:Let's see, there's a speed-reading course at the university from 8:00 to 8:05.
SUPMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:Wait! Here's an ESP course.
LEADFEMALE:Strange, it doesn't give the address.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I don't want to go to any crummy movies or scuzzy meetings.
SUPFEMALE:Well, let's see what Wait, wait, here's a wonderful thing.

LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:I knew I shouldn't have come out tonight If it hadn't been for you, I wouldn't have been in the car.
LEADMALE:And if you hadn't seen that chipmunk, I never would have swerved to avoid it.
SUPMALE:It was exciting, wasn't it? Exciting? You call taking off a parked car's door exciting? It was for the sheriff sitting in the car.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you see the look on his face "What the?" The silly fool was still trying to roll up the window and it was on its way to Cheyenne.
LEADFEMALE:What was he doing in that car anyway? He was escorting that big black limousine in front of him.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, the one we crashed into.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, the same.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it's not your fault.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, you swerved to avoid that squirrel.
LEADMALE:You tell that to any judge in the country, and he'll believe you.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ): Oh, really? What makes you think the judge would take my word over the governor's? Ah, good point.
LEADMALE:There's a yin and yang to everything.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's the yin: if that car hadn't been there, we would have gone over the cliff.
OTHERMALE:The yang was the governor's car went over the cliff.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, was he mad.
LEADFEMALE:Well, not as mad as if he'd been in the car.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Are you boys new? No, actually he's about 45, 46; I'm kind of ageless.
OTHERMALE:She means is this our first time here.
LEADFEMALE:The answer is yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it's Mother Bell's policy to buy new customers their first drink.
LEADFEMALE:Paper parasols? I didn't know we were in Little Tokyo.
LEADMALE:There's no theater like an old theater I don't want any fruity drinks.
LEADFEMALE:Bring me a bourbon and water, and hold the water.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, bring me a Shirley Temple, and hold the curls; I don't want a hair ball.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me, miss, uh, tell me, what are these telephones for? They're all over the place.
LEADMALE:To call people.
LEADFEMALE:You can call anyone in this room.
OTHERMALE:This is a very friendly place.
LEADMALE:See? I told you.
LEADFEMALE:Don't I pick good places, huh? Didn't I do well, right? You bubblehead! This isn't just a bar; it's a pickup joint.
LEADMALE:( phone buzzes ) A what? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Pick up the phone.
OTHERFEMALE:( honking bark ) Hello.
LEADMALE:Well, I don't think I have one of those.
SUPMALE:Maybe my friend does.
SUPMALE:Well, if that was true, I'd have to be eight feet tall.
LEADFEMALE:Give me that.
LEADMALE:Don't you realize this is a swinging singles bar? And that kicks it, I'm going home.
SUPMALE:No, wait! Come on, Bick.
SUPFEMALE:It's time to flick.
LEADMALE:Let's go! Listen, come on, Bickley, you said you wanted to come here because you were lonely and bored, and look at all these people.
LEADFEMALE:They must've come here 'cause they were lonely and bored.
LEADMALE:Mork, you don't understand.
OTHERMALE:I've never felt comfortable meeting people.
SUPFEMALE:I never could do it.
LEADMALE:I always felt as though I was in over my head, and right now, I feel very uncomfortable, and I'd like to go home.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Would you boys mind if we joined you? You know, I never did get my bourbon.
OTHERMALE:I'm Lisa, and this is Penny.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Oh, a Penny for my thoughts.
SUPMALE:Heads or tails.
LEADFEMALE:( honking bark ) Just watch those thoughts because this is my daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Mother and da-da- daw-daw-daw-daw a little kid.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Well, the family that plays together stays together.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:It's not like that at all.
LEADMALE:Look, Mom just got into town, and I wanted to take her out, so we came here.
LEADFEMALE:I had no idea this was a a swinger's bar.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADMALE:And, you see, what's happened is that there are two fellas over there, and they've been, um, well, you know, looking at us.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you mean those two guys that look like the history of leather.
LEADMALE:( both laughing ) Well put.
SUPMALE:Look, we figured I mean, if you fellas wouldn't mind that we'd pretend that you were our dates so they'd leave us alone.
SUPMALE:Is that okay? Well, sure, um, I guess so.
SUPMALE:My name is Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Nana-nanu.
LEADMALE:And this is Bickley.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley, would you like them to be our dates? ( stammering ): Absowubely.
LEADFEMALE:Ahb dowms Uh, uh, uh, bourbon! Uh well, uh, do you fellas come here very often? No, this is our first time.
SUPMALE:We're just kind of bored and lonely guys looking for meaningful life in this existence.
LEADFEMALE:But now you've given us some meaning, and Bickley, is this what Earth's all about? No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:This is our first time here.
LEADFEMALE:PENNY: Uh what's your sign? Ah, Nefarious, with egg rising.
SUPFEMALE:( laughing ) And, uh, where do you live? Oh, right here in Boulder.
SUPMALE:Libra.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a Libra.
LEADFEMALE:Libra.
LEADMALE:I can't believe this is happening.
SUPMALE:Neither can I.
LEADFEMALE:If the fruity drink lady comes by again, would you like us to get you something? Oh, thanks, but we've imposed enough.
LEADFEMALE:BICKLEY: Boulder.
SUPMALE:I live in Boulder.
LEADMALE:This is great! Just great! LISA: Listen, um you know those two fellas um, they're staring at us again.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa.
OTHERFEMALE:Bang-bang.
SUPMALE:Uh, those guys give me the creeps.
LEADMALE:Look, why don't we go somewhere else, and we'll buy you guys a drink.
SUPFEMALE:Good idea.
LEADMALE:Hey, that sounds fantastic.
LEADFEMALE:Anything not to be bored and lonely again.
LEADMALE:Whoa, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, why don't we buy you two girls a drink? Waitress, could we have those two freebie drinks back again? You know, the fruit- and-umbrella numbers? Boy, you can't believe what we fell into here.
LEADMALE:This is the happiest day of my life.
SUPFEMALE:Uh Scratch that.
LEADMALE:My greedy neighbor just ran off with my mother and daughter.
SUPFEMALE:( phone buzzes ) Keep it.
LEADMALE:Bick, Bick, what's keeping you? Come on, you got to get going.
OTHERFEMALE:The girls are ready to go, and you'll never guess what happened.
LEADFEMALE:They want to take us to a house.
SUPMALE:You'll never guess whose house.
OTHERMALE:Not theirs? Close.
LEADFEMALE:Yours! Oh! Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:( talking and laughing ) Oh! Will you look at this.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, isn't this nice.
LEADMALE:Yes, it's darling.
OTHERFEMALE:See? Isn't it nice to have friends over? It's wonderful! See, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Bickley's not used to having people over.
SUPMALE:Well, he's kind of a grouch, but we're trying to help him through it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, last February I almost grinned.
OTHERMALE:Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:( laughing ) Whoa Well, now that we're here, let's get down to a really good game of Parcheesi.
LEADMALE:Would you mind if we powder our nose first? Oh, gladly, but just don't use gunpowder or you'll visit your head in Utah.
SUPMALE:Thanks for the advice.
LEADMALE:( honking bark ) Where is it? It's right through there, just across from the bedroom.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Come on, honey.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that yeah, right Oh, Mork, this is impossible to believe.
SUPFEMALE:Never in my entire life have I ever picked up a girl before.
OTHERFEMALE:I was always afraid to try.
LEADMALE:But, you know, it's not so hard once you give it a try.
SUPFEMALE:All it takes is a little self-assertion.
LEADMALE:( laughs ) 'Cause, if you got it, you got it.
LEADMALE:You got it, and we want it.
OTHERMALE:What was it? What is it? A stickup.
LEADMALE:LISA: All right, Oh come on, everybody up, up, up.
SUPMALE:Hands up in the air.
SUPMALE:I don't want to have to scatter you all around the room.
SUPMALE:Can't you point that thing the other way? No.
SUPFEMALE:It wouldn't have the same impact.
SUPMALE:Now, come on, empty your pockets on the table.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Hurry up.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks a lot, Mr.
LEADMALE:Matchmaker! Well, at least we're not bored anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Miss, I hope you don't think I'm rude, but I think your mother's teaching you some bad habits.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, well, just think of it as charity.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd hardly ever donate my watch to charity.
LEADMALE:( car horn honks ) Okay, come on, that's Mark with the car.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
OTHERMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that should slow you down for a little while.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:It's been nice robbing you.
SUPMALE:Yeah, thanks for the date.
LEADFEMALE:It's been fun.
LEADMALE:( both laughing ) Shouldn't we have kissed them good night? MORK: They were so cute.
LEADMALE:MAN: Well Thanks a lot, Officer.
LEADFEMALE:I know you'll find them.
LEADFEMALE:Ciao.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Bick.
OTHERMALE:We'll get our stuff back.
LEADFEMALE:Those girls robbed three other guys in the same bar, and the police are gonna have a cookout.
LEADFEMALE:Stakeout.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I don't mind talking to a policeman for an hour this time of night, but I resent his shaking his head and giggling the whole time.
LEADMALE:Come on, it's a new wave silly cops.
LEADFEMALE:Haven't you watched CHiPs? Hi.
LEADMALE:How's Uncle Jack? Oh, I think he'll be all right.
LEADFEMALE:He just had a cork stuck in his throat.
LEADMALE:How was your weekend? Why do you ask? Well, to be perfectly honest with you, I thought that since I was gone you'd run out of things to do and be bored.
SUPMALE:Oh, me? Good-time Morky bored? We had a fantastic time.
SUPMALE:Bicky, tell her if you've got any strength left after our wild and wonderful weekend.
SUPMALE:He didn't let up all weekend.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we had a wonderful time.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, our company just left.
SUPMALE:What company? BICKLEY: Um, uh, Mork and I met a couple of girls.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we went to a gymnastics bar.
SUPMALE:It was incredible.
LEADMALE:And we met these wonderful friends.
SUPFEMALE:We'll take you there, and you can make friends, too.
LEADFEMALE:How friendly were these friends? Do we look like the kind of guys who would kiss and tell? Mindy, you should've seen the mother.
OTHERFEMALE:So beautiful.
SUPFEMALE:MINDY: Mother?! I don't think I want to hear about this.
LEADFEMALE:Then I can tell you about the daughter.
LEADMALE:You wanna hear about that, huh, maybe? I know I don't want to hear this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a little tired.
SUPMALE:I think I'm gonna go to bed.
LEADMALE:I'll talk to you about this tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Good night, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley.
OTHERMALE:Good night, Mr.
LEADMALE:Goodbar.
LEADMALE:But wait! Mindy! You'll never guess who we ran into the governor.
SUPFEMALE:Whew! Wow.
SUPMALE:You know something, Bicky? When we were going through it tonight, it was it was kind of terrifying, but telling Mindy right now, it sounded really good to me.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I agree.
LEADMALE:Maybe from a distance, we can appreciate what we've experienced better rather than when we were actually going through the trauma of having No, that's bull.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I guess people forget the fun things and only remember the exciting things.
OTHERFEMALE:We weren't bored, so we must've accomplished what we wanted to do.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Wish they hadn't robbed us, though.
LEADFEMALE:We sure have a heck of a story to tell our grandkids.
SUPMALE:Well, good night, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, Bick.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, I was thinking Saturday night? Be there or be square! There are millions of stories on this planet.
LEADMALE:This has just been one of them.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, the Incredible Bulk.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:ORSON: Did you have an interesting week, Mork? Oh, yes, sir, I met some people called "thieves.
SUPFEMALE:" Thieves? What are thieves? Well, thieves are people who steal things.
SUPMALE:First of all, there are jewel thieves, who steal precious gems and stones, there are cat burglars, who steal pets, and then the Pittsburgh Steelers, who steal entire cities.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell me Boulder, Colorado, got taken.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, sir, just me and Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley.
LEADFEMALE:We were robbed by some lady friends that Bickley said we never should've trusted to begin with.
LEADFEMALE:I thought earthlings believed in trust.
OTHERMALE:Even that dollar bill you sent me had "In God We Trust" written on it.
LEADFEMALE:Orson, you can't believe everything you read.
LEADMALE:It also said that it's worth a dollar.
SUPFEMALE:Let me understand.
SUPFEMALE:You were robbed by two friends? Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, they were pretty and soft.
LEADFEMALE:Well soft on the outside, and kind of hard on the inside.
LEADFEMALE:You mean, on Earth, your friends will rob you? Well, if they do, they're not really friends, then.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mindy's your friend.
SUPMALE:How do you know that someday she won't rob you? Well, sir, I don't think she's that kind of friend, and even if she were, she'd have to rob me thousands of times just to get back half of what she's given me.
OTHERFEMALE:So until next week.
SUPMALE:Give me an "N"! "N.
OTHERMALE:" Give me an "A"! "A.
SUPMALE:" Give me another "N"! "N.
LEADFEMALE:" Give me a big "O"! "O.
LEADMALE:" What's that spell? Nanu.
SUPFEMALE:Wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:Nano.
LEADFEMALE:See you next week, Orsoon.
LEADMALE:Nanu! Ha-ha-ha-ha! What a chump! 
OTHERFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
OTHERFEMALE:Shazbot! Okay left foot on the blue dot.
SUPFEMALE:GIRL: Look out! Oh what happened? ( laughter ) I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:And Mork I'm sorry I sat on your face.
LEADFEMALE:That's all right, Julius.
LEADMALE:I do it all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? Great.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Are you all right? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:I love to play "Squash the Alien.
LEADMALE:" Oh.
LEADMALE:Could you breathe down there? Only out.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm sorry all those people fell on you, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's a great game.
LEADMALE:Let's play another game like, "Musical Spikes" or "Hide and Go Kill.
LEADFEMALE:" Ah, Why don't you just come out and say you don't want to play this silly game.
LEADMALE:I didn't want to be rude.
SUPMALE:( knock on door ) Come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I'll spin again.
LEADMALE:Please don't get up.
SUPMALE:They didn't come in that way, did they? That's obscene.
OTHERFEMALE:It looks like a Christmas card from Hugh Hefner.
LEADFEMALE:It's just a game.
SUPFEMALE:See, they're not supposed to fall over.
LEADFEMALE:Oh? Left hand to blue ( screaming ) Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley, you can't just come in here and start shoving my guests around.
SUPMALE:You should at least ask first.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know what that sounds like downstairs? Like R2-D2 trying to do a soft-shoe.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:We just started playing this game.
OTHERMALE:And what trouble-maker is sucking ice into his mouth and spitting it back into an empty glass? Oh, sorry.
LEADFEMALE:And stop putting ice cubes in your drinks.
LEADFEMALE:You know what it's like being under 13 people all tinkling at once.
SUPMALE:I guess we'll have to try and be more quiet.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell you what we'll only play "spin the sock", and we'll replace our stereo needle with a Q-tip and we'll only play charades wearing gloves.
OTHERMALE:Shut up! Thank you.
LEADMALE:Look, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Bickley look, I have just about had it BICKLEY: Hey, don't try to get cozy with me, sweetie pie.
LEADFEMALE:I'm steamed.
LEADFEMALE:And when I'm steamed, it's no more Mr.
OTHERMALE:Wonderful.
SUPMALE:I have my rights and I'm not leaving here until there's no more dancing, singing, laughing, talking or bodily sounds.
LEADMALE:( all groaning ) Oh, sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Look at that, it's 8:30 already.
SUPMALE:Well, we better be going Wait a minute you guys.
LEADFEMALE:Don't let him scare you off.
LEADMALE:See you later.
LEADMALE:Oh, really Come on, Julius I'm sorry, Mindy.
LEADMALE:I have to go.
SUPMALE:I have a self-assertion class.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid if I'm late, they'll kill me.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Julius.
LEADMALE:We'll get together again real soon.
SUPFEMALE:Over my dead body.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, that's a great game.
OTHERFEMALE:It takes a long time to play though and gets kind of gross near the end.
OTHERMALE:Well, I hope you're happy.
LEADMALE:Everyone's gone.
LEADMALE:When it comes to parties, I'm the super pooper.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley, you are the worst you are the most unreasonable Don't forget cantankerous.
LEADFEMALE:That's on my business cards.
LEADMALE:Hey, what's this? A transistor noise-maker? No, no, no, no, see that's a radio for deaf mutes.
OTHERMALE:See? I love you more than you'll ever know Turn it down.
SUPMALE:( sings softly ): I love you more than you'll ever know I know what it is, Mr.
SUPMALE:Wiseacre.
SUPMALE:It's a pocket calculator.
LEADFEMALE:Big deal! Well, this is an incredibly boring party.
OTHERMALE:You know, it's funny.
LEADFEMALE:When you're actually up here, it's not so noisy.
SUPFEMALE:Whew, boy, am I glad he didn't start pushing any buttons on this Age Machine.
OTHERFEMALE:Why? I think it would be funny seeing Bickley acting like a little kid.
LEADFEMALE:Except, he'd probably tell his mother to put a muffler on his rattle.
LEADMALE:That's impossible.
LEADFEMALE:You see, only Orkans are affected by the Age Machine.
LEADMALE:No matter who presses these buttons, I'm the one who goes through the changes.
LEADFEMALE:Well then, you'd better put that in a safe place.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, you're right.
SUPMALE:I sat on it once and became two ages at once.
LEADMALE:That must've been terrible.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I became a Boy Scout and an octogenarian at the same time.
LEADFEMALE:I spent days helping myself across the street.
LEADMALE:MINDY: Dad, Grandma, has anybody seen my Mindy necklace? Well, I don't think it's here anywhere, honey.
LEADMALE:Did you lose it? Well, I-I took it off at my party last night and when we were cleaning up, I couldn't find it.
SUPFEMALE:It's my theory that it was sucked into a parallel universe.
LEADFEMALE:The same universe that socks go when you lose them in the dryer.
SUPMALE:I bet that Jimmy Hoffa is wearing it right now.
SUPMALE:Well, if you'll excuse me, I have a luncheon date.
OTHERMALE:And I must go and spray myself with Charlie .
LEADMALE:You know, I'd hate to think that somebody took it.
SUPFEMALE:It was just a cheap necklace.
OTHERMALE:I don't know why anybody would want it.
SUPMALE:All right, let's use our powers of deductive reasoning.
LEADFEMALE:Whoever took it had to be named "Mindy".
LEADMALE:Now who at the party was named Mindy? All right, up against the wall, sister! Move it! Move it! Move it! Come on.
LEADFEMALE:This is serious.
LEADMALE:Why would I take my own necklace? The insurance? Why don't you call up everybody who was at the party and ask if they're a despicable thief? Boy, I hate to think it was taken by a friend.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I've got an idea.
SUPFEMALE:I'll tell you what.
LEADMALE:We'll go to Jamaica, get a gris-gris man, put de voodoo on it, man, wait till his arms fall off, then we know, man.
SUPFEMALE:We got him hands down, boys.
OTHERMALE:( mimics dial tones ) Hello, Debbie Wilson? Yes, this is Mork.
OTHERMALE:I'm a friend of Mindy's.
LEADFEMALE:Well, any friend of Mindy's is a friend of mine, too.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, did you steal Mindy's necklace? What? I don't know what that has to do with anything, but yes, I can blow it out my ear.
LEADMALE:No, I'm sorry, not raw.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh! Some friend! Hi.
LEADMALE:Guess what I got us for dinner.
SUPMALE:I got us some spare ribs.
LEADFEMALE:Did you find my necklace? ( mimics Bogart ): No, because I'm still playing detective.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, sweetheart, if you'd like to be my assistant, how about your going in the bedroom and slipping on that flimsy negligee I got for you.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Sherlock, when you find out who dunnit, you let me know.
LEADMALE:I found out who didn't done it.
SUPMALE:I phoned everyone in your class and accused them.
SUPMALE:You what? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:When I ran out of that, I had to widen the search.
LEADFEMALE:I used this book of mug shots here.
LEADMALE:Those aren't mug shots.
OTHERMALE:That's my high school yearbook.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah? What about this one? Linda Birchey.
SUPMALE:She received the Catharine The Great Award from the 4-H Club, was voted "loosest and most likely to succeed.
SUPFEMALE:" Mork, that girl isn't a criminal.
LEADFEMALE:She's a cheerleader.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that explains when she told me to drop dead, she spelled out: Give me a "D," give me an "R," give me an "O.
OTHERFEMALE:" Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You talked to her? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:I called everybody in this book.
LEADFEMALE:And by the way, Molly Berger says hello and she'd like to push your face in a Cuisinart.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe you called all my friends.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe what they called you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, how could you do this to me? Do this to you? I'm the one that had to take the abuse and the threats.
SUPFEMALE:Threats? Yes, but don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:No one's going to burn down this house as long as I'm alive.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork! Wow! I didn't know we had one of these! Oh, I forgot.
LEADMALE:You haven't seen one of those before, have you? Are you kidding? I know how to use this.
SUPFEMALE:Watch this, mama.
LEADMALE:( hums "Sweet Georgia Brown" ) Meadowlark, check this action.
SUPFEMALE:I'm goin' in for a slam dunk.
LEADFEMALE:Ta-da! Oh, no, I didn't know it was with litter.
OTHERMALE:( sobs ) That was our dessert.
SUPMALE:Oh, heavy melon-choly.
OTHERFEMALE:( knocking ) No, it might be the Fruit Police! Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:I'll answer the door.
LEADMALE:We have to be cautious about this.
LEADMALE:( muttering in Orkan ) Are you expecting a zipper? You have some nerve, McConnell.
SUPFEMALE:She's also got a great set of frontal lobes, too.
LEADMALE:I can't work with all this noise.
OTHERMALE:Sorry about that.
SUPMALE:That won't happen again, will it, Wilt? Not until we grow another ball.
LEADMALE:It better not.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been stuck on the same verse for hours.
SUPFEMALE:Why didn't you come to me for help? Listen, what are neighbors for? I was tops in my poetry class.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen to this.
LEADFEMALE:There was a young fweeble from glerm, whose foboes were stuck in her blerm.
LEADMALE:As she plimmeled her quaft and said with a twaft Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:That's good.
LEADFEMALE:It's filthy, but it's good.
LEADFEMALE:I knew you'd like it.
LEADMALE:Hey, that's an idea.
SUPMALE:I'll change my verse to a limerick.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, thanks.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot.
OTHERMALE:That's terrific.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:And no more noise up here! And now I've got to decide whether to move to another city or apologize personally to my entire graduating class.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to solve the case.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I know, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Your heart was in the right place.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, it's still there.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, wait a minute, the ribs are gone.
LEADMALE:No, if they were gone, I couldn't breathe.
SUPMALE:I'd just blow up like No, no.
SUPFEMALE:They were here a minute ago and now they're gone.
LEADFEMALE:All right, then let me retrace my steps.
LEADFEMALE:( speaks backward ) I was right here.
SUPMALE:And Bickley was right here and now Bickley and the ribs are gone.
LEADFEMALE:Well, who'd want to steal Bickley? No, Mork, Bickley stole the ribs.
SUPMALE:Why would he want to do that? I don't know.
SUPMALE:But he was at the party last night, too.
LEADMALE:Aha.
LEADFEMALE:And he had access to your pork.
SUPMALE:I don't understand it, but he must have done it.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, let's put the clues together.
SUPMALE:First the necklace.
OTHERFEMALE:Now Grand Theft, pork.
SUPMALE:That proves he's not Kosher.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Shazbot! What? He stole my Orkan Age Machine.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, that could be terrible.
SUPMALE:He doesn't know what he has.
LEADFEMALE:And if he starts pressing those buttons ( speaking baby gibberish ) Oh, it's okay, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:He's gotta press another button soon I hope.
LEADMALE:Whew.
SUPMALE:I'm back.
SUPMALE:I'm glad he didn't keep me there too long, because at that age I wasn't housebroken.
LEADMALE:He must've taken your Age Machine because he thought it was a calculator.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I just hope he doesn't try to balance his checkbook tonight, or I could be doing squats with Sitting Bull.
OTHERMALE:I just can't believe.
OTHERMALE:( older man ): Whew! All right, hon, that was a wonderful TV dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, not tonight, though, I have a headache.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know what I'm talking about? Tell you what.
LEADMALE:Let's pack the kids in the car, we'll have a martini, then we'll go to the PTA meeting.
SUPMALE:We'll raise the flag.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no! Oh-oh, I can't believe what he's doing.
SUPMALE:He set it for "Middle-Age".
LEADMALE:I didn't even know I had an attachment for "Middle America".
LEADFEMALE:We'd better stop him before he sets it for "Old Age" or even worse, "Cadaver.
OTHERFEMALE:" "Cadaver"? You mean, like in corpse? Oh, yeah, you should try it sometime.
OTHERMALE:You always said you wanted to see if your nails could be longer.
SUPMALE:This is serious.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe Mr.
OTHERMALE:Bickley has kleptomania.
LEADFEMALE:What's that? Well, a kleptomaniac is a person that steals compulsively.
LEADMALE:Oh, like politicians.
SUPMALE:( teenager ): Hey, Betty Lou, come on.
LEADMALE:Let's go down to the lake and listen to my voice change.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Let's go ( child's voice ) Look cooties, cooties! Da-da-da-da-da! Nyah-nyah-yah nyah-nyah-yah! Whoa! He must be doing long division now! We've got to stop him before he does square roots and sends me all the way back along my evolutionary track.
SUPMALE:You mean, all the way back to the ape? Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:You see, on Ork there were no apes.
LEADFEMALE:We evolved from ( clucking like chicken ) ( loud crashing ) ( knocking ) Mork! Is that you? Does this live here? Uh yes, he does, Officer.
LEADMALE:His name is Mork.
LEADMALE:Mork? I thought it was Henny Penny.
OTHERFEMALE:I found him acting like a chicken and running back and forth across the highway.
LEADMALE:Mork, why were you crossing the road? I think I was evolving a joke.
SUPMALE:I had this strange urge to get to the other side.
LEADMALE:He didn't do anything wrong, did he? We almost took him in on a 602: Pecking an Officer.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, my nose is killing me.
LEADFEMALE:What, uh, happened to your clothes? I was molting.
LEADMALE:POLICEMAN: That's why that's why I put that bag on him.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thanks for bringing him home.
SUPFEMALE:Is this some kind of fraternity prank? No, I'm just weird.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah! That's what it is.
SUPFEMALE:It's a fraternity prank.
OTHERFEMALE:Shake the officer's hand, Mork.
LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:Oh! Sigma-Delta-Phi! I'm Alpha-Nu.
SUPMALE:You know Iggy-diggy.
SUPMALE:( wails ) See you around the campus, buddy.
SUPFEMALE:( chuckles ) My kind of guy.
LEADMALE:Are you all right? Yeah, now I am.
OTHERFEMALE:But he sent me all the way back to cave-chicken.
SUPMALE:It was really a drag building fires, trying to hatch everything I could find.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't have a baby in the last half hour, did you? No, I don't think so.
OTHERFEMALE:Phew! I'm glad I didn't do that fertility dance barefooted, then.
LEADFEMALE:What's in the bag? Oh, the usual seeds, corn one egg I tried to hatch.
LEADFEMALE:Phew! What a drag that was.
LEADFEMALE:And this this came off a woman I was dragging to build a nest.
SUPFEMALE:The good parts got away, though.
SUPFEMALE:Well, at least you're back to normal now.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but that's just for the moment.
LEADFEMALE:Who knows? If he starts using that machine again, I could be a gleam in some Cro-Magnon rooster's eye.
SUPMALE:Well, Mork, the only way to handle the situation is we're just going to have to confront Bickley, and tell him to give us our stuff back.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm with you, Mama.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:We're going to make that rat squeal.
LEADMALE:We're gonna make him let the cat out of the bag and let the beans fall now! Come on, let's go! Let's go.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, don't you think you ought to change first? I guess you're right.
LEADMALE:It's kind of hard to look macho in a green plastic dress.
LEADMALE:( knocking ) MINDY: Come on, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley, open up.
SUPFEMALE:MORK: Yoo-hoo, sticky fingers! ( imitates humming whoosh ) It's all right.
SUPMALE:He's not here.
SUPMALE:Let's go.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:We'd better not.
SUPMALE:Come on, Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:We've got to get that Age Machine back.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but Mork, it's against the law to go into somebody's apartment when they're not home, even if the door is unlocked.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, can you honestly say that, since Watergate? Let's go.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but we could get in trouble! No, come on! Look, Bickley's working on a new greeting card.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see this "To a brave and fearless hunter, "whose face is really red.
LEADFEMALE:"You thought you winged a turkey, but it was your brother's head.
SUPFEMALE:" Boy, he's got one for every occasion.
OTHERMALE:Look, here's your Age Machine.
SUPMALE:Ah! Let's see if it's still working.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll set it for "One Second Ago.
OTHERFEMALE:" ( beeping ) I'll set it for "One Second Ago.
LEADMALE:" I'll set it for "One Second Ago.
LEADFEMALE:" ( beeping ) Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you Ah! That thing is dangerous.
LEADMALE:Look! There's my Mindy necklace.
LEADFEMALE:Ha! All the evidence is in.
LEADFEMALE:Necklace meat and this Obviously, we're dealing with a carnivorous transvestite with an age hang-up.
LEADMALE:BICKLEY: "M" is for the million things she gave me He's coming! "O" means only that she's growing old What do we do? Mallard! Mallard! What? Duck! "R" means right And right means ever true Put them all together, they spell "Mother" And that's what I will always be to you.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, sing along.
OTHERFEMALE:You can do it.
SUPMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:"M" is for the million things she gave Uh-oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Running a little low.
LEADMALE:I'd better get back to the old friendly skies.
LEADMALE:I've got a surprise for you.
LEADMALE:That's why I made you wear a blindfold in the Doggie Department.
LEADFEMALE:Look, isn't it cute? Your own little fire hydrant.
SUPMALE:With your own little magazine rack.
OTHERMALE:Oh, and here's a treat to make your teeth grow in big and strong and sharp.
LEADMALE:Make the mailman earn that last raise we had to give him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, woodgie-woodgie! Oh! Bicky, you and I are so much alike, except for the hair and the ears and the tail and the fleas.
LEADFEMALE:Hope I didn't give you any.
SUPFEMALE:You're the only true friend I have.
LEADMALE:You know I sometimes feel you're like a son to me a sweet little boy.
LEADFEMALE:I-I wonder, if you could talk, what you would say to me.
OTHERMALE:( high-pitched voice ): You're a thief, Pop Well, that hurts, Bicky.
LEADMALE:That rea Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Dogs can't talk.
LEADMALE:There must be another animal in here! Come on out! Come on! Hi! No shoot, G.
OTHERMALE:I.
LEADFEMALE:, no shoot.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, what are you two doing here? Uh Hey, this is trespassing.
LEADMALE:Well, uh You're breaking and entering.
LEADMALE:You're thieves! Burglars! Oh, no, it's not like that.
LEADFEMALE:See Well, I'm sure there is a very reasonable explanation why you are in my apartment.
LEADFEMALE:All right, let's hear it.
SUPMALE:MINDY: Yes.
LEADMALE:As a matter of fact, there is a reason why we're in your apartment.
SUPMALE:We came here to get the stuff back that you stole from us.
LEADFEMALE:Prove it.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think I'd take the word of a couple of burglars? Aw, come on, Bickley.
LEADMALE:Cut the canine residue, and let's get to it.
SUPMALE:Why'd you do it? You're so fond of those stupid party games.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you guess? All right.
OTHERFEMALE:You're a kleptomaniac.
LEADFEMALE:Wrong! Want some dip? Oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:You did it for the money? No! Want a cocktail weenie? How do you get money for fencing pork ribs? I've got it! You horrible man! You're building a Frankenpig.
LEADMALE:Not even close.
LEADMALE:You want a soft drink? Oh, thank you.
SUPMALE:Don't thank me.
OTHERFEMALE:They're yours.
SUPMALE:Oh, for a thief, you're awfully gracious.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Anyone want to dance? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley, this is not a party.
OTHERMALE:Well, not with everybody standing around like this.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley, did you take our things so that we'd come down here to talk to you? Hogwash! Why would I want to see you? You didn't invite me to your party.
LEADMALE:Whoa, you mean you really wanted to come? I would have gladly slipped a disc to play that stupid game.
LEADFEMALE:As it was, I had to come down here and play it with Bicky.
LEADMALE:You really love that ball of fur we gave you, don't you? My wife and I tried for years, but we couldn't have one of our own.
LEADMALE:Ooh, heavy sigh.
LEADMALE:A dogless couple.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't know you were married.
SUPFEMALE:I lost her in 1966.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Every night I pray the old bat doesn't find me.
LEADMALE:She didn't like me, either.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Mr.
SUPMALE:Bickley, to have friends, you've got to be nice, too.
OTHERFEMALE:There's always a price.
LEADMALE:That's what I like about Bicky.
SUPFEMALE:I don't have to do anything to make him like me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, now, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:I see you walking him all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and I see you feeding him and talking to him and scooping up after him.
SUPMALE:That's a lot of work.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's worth it.
LEADFEMALE:He's never said an unkind word to me.
SUPMALE:Well, what the point is, is that it's not that hard to be nice.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and it was a lot of work to steal all this stuff just so we'd come down and visit you.
LEADFEMALE:Stealing wasn't all that much work, especially when it's from someone you really care about.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley, I'm sorry you think we slighted you.
SUPMALE:There.
SUPMALE:Listen, from now on, we're going to be the best of friends, okay? Yeah, and if we ever find anything missing again, I promise we'll come to you first.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, that's really nice.
OTHERMALE:Look I'm not used to this sentimental garbage.
SUPMALE:I'll have to take a little of this swill at a time.
SUPMALE:Come on, get out of here, you guys.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Hit the road.
SUPMALE:That's it.
SUPFEMALE:Come on! Vamoose, amscray.
SUPMALE:That's it for the night.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:We want to be alone.
LEADFEMALE:And if you find anything of yours missing, come by our place and come look for it, okay? Around dinner time.
LEADMALE:And don't play that stolen radio all night! Some watchdog you are! Come on, you want to have a party? Mork calling Orson come in, Orson Mork calling Orson come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:( imitates drumbeat ) Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:( imitates drumbeat ) Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:( Orson singing aria ) Everything all right, Orson? Yes, this better be good, Mork.
LEADMALE:You got me out of the shower.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please don't shake yourself dry this time, Your Immenseness.
LEADMALE:Last time, it rained for weeks.
LEADFEMALE:Get on with it, Mork, while I look for a towel.
SUPMALE:Oh, don't tarry, sir.
LEADMALE:( honking bark ) The report, Mork! Sir! This week, I discovered a terrible Earth disease called "loneliness.
LEADMALE:" Do many people on Earth suffer from this illness? Oh, yes, sir.
OTHERMALE:And how they suffer! One man I know suffers so much, that he has to take a medication called "bourbon.
LEADMALE:" Even that doesn't help very much, because he can hear paint dry.
SUPMALE:Does bed rest help? No, because I've heard that sleeping alone is part of the problem.
LEADMALE:You see, Orson, loneliness is a disease of the spirit.
LEADMALE:And people who have it think that no one cares about them.
LEADMALE:Do you have any idea why? Yes, sir.
LEADMALE:You can count on me.
SUPMALE:You see, when children are young, they're told not to talk to strangers.
OTHERMALE:And when they go to school, they're told not to talk to the person next to them.
LEADFEMALE:And finally, when they get to be very old, they're told not to talk to themselves.
LEADFEMALE:Who's left? Are you saying that Earthlings make each other lonely? No, sir, I'm saying just the opposite that they make themselves lonely.
SUPFEMALE:They're so busy looking out for number one, they don't have room for two.
LEADMALE:It's too bad everybody down there can't get together and find a cure.
LEADMALE:Well, here's the paradox, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Because if they did get together, they wouldn't need one.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't that Zenlike? One hand clapping Until next week nanu-nanu.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! Orson calling Mork.
LEADMALE:Come in, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Orson calling Mork.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Mork.
LEADMALE:Mork, activate your receiver mode and come in, please.
OTHERFEMALE:Orson, you never call me.
OTHERFEMALE:What's up, sweetheart, darling, baby? I have something very important to tell you, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, don't tell me you've got some heavy news.
SUPMALE:( honking bark ) Mork, I'm calling to tell you you're about to have a birthday.
LEADMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADFEMALE:My first? Now don't panic.
LEADMALE:Everything will be just fine if you do what I say.
LEADMALE:Why'd it have to happen to me? Couldn't someone else have had my first birthday? Calm down! ( blow landing ) Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I needed that.
LEADMALE:Every Orkan has to go through this.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, meet your gleek.
SUPMALE:Gleek? Now, on your birthday, you'll begin to run down.
LEADMALE:You'll speed up, you'll slow down.
SUPMALE:You'll have trouble talking.
LEADFEMALE:You'll act weird uh, uh, excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:You'll act weirder.
LEADMALE:Don't shake the gleek! You'll deactivate the chemicals.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry, Your Fattitude.
LEADFEMALE:That gleek must be in perfect working order when you hit it against your head to recharge yourself.
LEADFEMALE:No problem, Your Immenseness.
LEADMALE:I'll guard it as if my life depended on it.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, your life does depend on it.
LEADMALE:Whew! No pressure.
SUPFEMALE:Well, sir, I've got to be going.
LEADMALE:I've got a new job at a place called a kennel.
LEADFEMALE:It's populated with creatures just like Venusians, only smarter.
OTHERFEMALE:Lucky you speak Venusian.
LEADMALE:Ah, you bet.
SUPMALE:( growling and barking ) ( howling ) ( whistles ) I just can't believe it.
OTHERMALE:It's so good to see you again.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:Three months is too long for friends like us to be apart.
LEADMALE:Did you know that if we were snails, we'd already be dead? So much has happened, Joyce.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Like my name isn't Joyce anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:It's Rainbow.
SUPMALE:Do you want some coffee? No, I never drink caffeine.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, how 'bout a soft drink? Mindy, sugar is suicide.
OTHERFEMALE:Can you drink water? It's got fluorides in it.
LEADMALE:Well, what can you drink? Do you have a beer? Doesn't beer have chemicals in it, too? Yeah, but after a six-pack, who cares? Good point.
OTHERFEMALE:Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, other person.
LEADMALE:Mork, I want you to meet my good friend, Rainbow.
LEADMALE:Rainbow, this is Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and double it.
SUPMALE:Nanu-nanu.
OTHERFEMALE:I like him already.
LEADMALE:You know, I get so tired of that hippie handshake, you know, and those people who keep saying the same boring clichÃ©s.
LEADMALE:So, by the way, what's your sign? I think Mork's a moon child.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Mindy, you know moon children are only this big with mold on their heads and terrible acne.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, how'd your first day at the kennel go? Oh I don't know why they call it work, it was so easy.
LEADFEMALE:They told me to take the dogs for a walk, and I could see they could walk by themselves, so I let them out.
SUPFEMALE:I told them to be back by midnight.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, they'll never come back.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes, they will.
LEADMALE:They promised.
SUPMALE:Well, Mork, you might as well not go back to work at the kennel tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:He's been having a hard time finding a job.
LEADMALE:Really? Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, I run a health food store, and I've been looking for a revolutionary moon child stock boy.
SUPFEMALE:How would you like to try it? Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Does a Martian have eight legs? ( singing in Orkan ) Whoa.
SUPMALE:I still respect you.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, none for you until you finish that bologna sandwich I gave you the other day.
LEADMALE:When I think of all the starving plants in Asia.
SUPFEMALE:What? You don't eat meat? Oh, you're a humanitarian.
OTHERMALE:What? Then I'll fix you a salad next time.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Might be somebody you know.
LEADFEMALE:( singing in Orkan ) ( singing in reverse ) ( singing in slow motion ) Shh.
LEADFEMALE:Shh.
SUPMALE:( imitates race car driving ) There's the phone.
SUPMALE:Shut up! I know what it was! Give me a chance! I don't know who that is.
LEADFEMALE:Get him off.
OTHERFEMALE:Whew! I'm okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody off! Everybody off! ( laughs ) Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Good-bye, hello, good-bye.
LEADMALE:Jive turkey.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I need my recharge.
LEADFEMALE:I need my gleek.
SUPFEMALE:( speaking Orkan ) Gleek, gleek.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:Whew! Oh, my little gleek.
SUPFEMALE:( beeping ) Gleek, don't fail me now.
LEADFEMALE:( beeping ) ( groans ) What's wrong, are you dumb? Hmm? No, it's not time to recharge yet.
SUPFEMALE:I've got two more hours.
SUPFEMALE:I'd better set my watch.
LEADMALE:Ankle watch, set, set.
LEADFEMALE:Ankle watch still ticking.
SUPFEMALE:Gleek, I can't let you out of my sight today.
LEADFEMALE:If I do, I'd be up the Milky Way without a paddle.
LEADFEMALE:( whistling ) Mindy, get the phone.
LEADMALE:( squeaks ) I told her.
LEADFEMALE:Be quiet! Hello? There's nobody there.
SUPMALE:Same thing happened to me.
SUPMALE:Phone again.
SUPMALE:Shut up! I heard it! Get at the phone.
LEADMALE:I will! ( singing in Orkan ) Listen, dirtball, I've had it up to here with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah? ( beeps ) to you, too.
SUPMALE:Mork, will you stop kidding around? What's that? It's a rope.
SUPFEMALE:What's it for? Well, it serves a very important purpose.
SUPMALE:( snoring ) I can't remember what for, though.
LEADFEMALE:Are you all right? I think so.
LEADMALE:I had trouble sleeping last night.
SUPFEMALE:I tossed and turned, which is not very easy, considering I sleep hanging from a bar.
LEADMALE:Well, if you're tired, why don't you go crash for a while? I'm not into pain, but I think a nap will do.
SUPMALE:Mindy! What? Mindy, I remember what the rope is for! Oh.
LEADFEMALE:It's an old Orkan custom.
LEADFEMALE:You see, when we want to remember something, we tie a rope around our neck.
OTHERMALE:Oh, we do the same thing, except we tie a little string around our finger.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, on Ork, that's how we used to hang cattle rustlers.
LEADMALE:Well, terrific.
LEADMALE:Now, what were you supposed to remember? Mm I can't remember.
LEADMALE:I forget.
LEADMALE:I I bet I know.
LEADFEMALE:What? Today's your interview at the Vitamin Vendor.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:Now I don't have to get ring around the rope.
LEADFEMALE:That's something very important.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you for reminding me.
LEADMALE:I know it's important to you, so good luck.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, don't do tricks like that at your interview.
LEADMALE:I'll see you later.
LEADMALE:You can count on me.
SUPFEMALE:Ciao.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Something's wrong.
LEADFEMALE:I ( moaning ) Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Either I'm sick, or I'm in Pisa.
LEADMALE:I'm all right now.
SUPFEMALE:Hold on, I must be sick.
LEADFEMALE:Let me see.
LEADFEMALE:No fever.
OTHERFEMALE:Wish I could remember what I'm supposed to do.
LEADMALE:Play back old tape.
LEADFEMALE:( clicking tongue, beeps ) Plants.
SUPFEMALE:Head back to plants.
LEADMALE:Plants are the clue.
LEADFEMALE:You still haven't eaten that bologna sandwich I gave you earlier.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you've got to eat so you can grow up and be big and strong like your father, Fern.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait! Food! Food.
LEADFEMALE:Gleek.
SUPMALE:Gleek! Ah, thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, good for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, if I forgot my gleek, that'd be a disaster if I fail to recharge myself.
LEADMALE:If I don't recharge, I might slow down, I speed up, my memory goes.
LEADMALE:I slow down, I speed up, my memory goes.
OTHERFEMALE:Wow, dÃ©jÃ  vu.
OTHERMALE:I feel like I've been here before.
OTHERMALE:I wish I could remember what I'm supposed to do.
SUPFEMALE:God, I got to remember.
SUPFEMALE:What am I talking about? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Give me a chance.
LEADFEMALE:You signed the contract.
SUPFEMALE:( ringing ) Ha, ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:You're not going to get me with that old phone trick.
OTHERMALE:Come in.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:( register chimes ) Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:My violin sounds a lot better now, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Hudson.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I knew it would once I shook your pet turtle out of it.
SUPMALE:Well, the lesson's over, and I'm going to lunch.
SUPMALE:Oh, enjoy it.
SUPMALE:Where you going to go? That new continental cafe.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Chez Eddie? Is that place any good? Of course.
LEADMALE:All the French truck drivers eat there.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess I have to hang around here.
OTHERFEMALE:My mom doesn't pick me up for another hour.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Well, I'll give you a ride home.
LEADMALE:Okay, on one condition.
LEADMALE:This time, you don't pop any wheelies.
LEADFEMALE:So long, folks.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, have a nice lunch, Gram.
LEADFEMALE:Your grandmother is always out to lunch.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, what are you doing here? I thought I had an interview.
LEADMALE:You do, at the Vitamin Vendor.
LEADMALE:I don't feel too well, especially when I left the house.
SUPFEMALE:I Well, you look fine now.
LEADMALE:Well, it comes and goes.
SUPFEMALE:Are you all right? Oh, certainly I'm all right.
LEADMALE:( caws ) Pull! ( imitates gunshot ) Daddy, I think he might need a doctor.
LEADMALE:Uh, he's asleep standing on his feet.
LEADMALE:Is that normal for him? Not at all.
SUPFEMALE:Normally, he sleeps hanging from a bar.
SUPMALE:Charley, I could've been a contender.
LEADMALE:Feelin' good now Punchin' meat now Suckin' eggs now.
LEADFEMALE:You know something? I think you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'm going to go get that doctor.
SUPFEMALE:He's out here in the mall.
LEADMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Mork? Huh, what? Whoa, who took my bones? ( alarm buzzing ) Oh, your foot's ringing.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
SUPMALE:Don't answer it.
SUPFEMALE:They'll just hang up.
OTHERFEMALE:It's your ankle-watch.
SUPMALE:( turns off alarm ) What's this piece of paper? Must be a footnote.
SUPMALE:It says, "Dear Mork, just a reminder.
LEADFEMALE:"If you don't use your gleek, "you'll be dead in one hour.
LEADMALE:Love Mork.
SUPFEMALE:" Whoa.
SUPMALE:Oh! Mork, what's a gleek? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what did you mean when you said you were going to be dead in one hour? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I heard that somewhere, though.
LEADMALE:In that note.
LEADMALE:Why did you write that note? What note? Oh.
SUPFEMALE:This note.
OTHERMALE:Look, it's in your own handwriting.
LEADMALE:( muttering ) I'm going to be dead.
LEADMALE:Oh, I miss me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, I'm gonna die.
LEADMALE:Heavy sigh.
LEADMALE:Anxiety.
LEADFEMALE:Anger mixed with inner turmoil.
SUPMALE:Oh no, I'm seeing my whole life flash before me.
SUPMALE:( buzzing sound ) No big deal.
LEADMALE:I've got so much to do.
SUPFEMALE:There's only an hour left.
SUPMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:( humming ) Wait.
OTHERFEMALE:At last, a cure for acne.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to thank the Academy.
OTHERMALE:No one helped me get this award.
LEADMALE:I Mork, what are you doing? I've only got an hour left, Mindy, and I I want to reach for all the gusto I can.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Mork, oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, if only there were an hour and ten minutes.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Mindy, what are you doing after the funeral? Oh, Mork, stop.
LEADFEMALE:No, don't stop me now.
LEADFEMALE:I'm full of real zest for life! Oh.
LEADMALE:( moans ) Listen, sit down.
SUPMALE:Daddy went just across the mall.
SUPFEMALE:He's getting a doctor, so Why, is he sick? No, you're sick.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I can't be.
LEADFEMALE:I've got to go to that interview.
LEADFEMALE:Forget that interview.
LEADMALE:Forget what? Here he is.
OTHERMALE:MINDY: Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, there.
SUPMALE:I'm Dr.
OTHERFEMALE:Ducky.
SUPFEMALE:Where's my little patient? That is not a child.
LEADMALE:What kind of a doctor did you say you were? I'm Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Benton Phillips, uh, pediatrician.
LEADMALE:It was either him or the foot doctor.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, Miss.
LEADFEMALE:I am a professional.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just take his temperature.
LEADFEMALE:Open for Mr.
SUPMALE:Mercury.
OTHERFEMALE:You die, bwana.
LEADMALE:( blows air ) ( muttering ) What do you think's wrong with him? Well, he's obviously very hyperactive.
LEADMALE:And somewhat sluggish.
LEADMALE:That's not possible.
LEADMALE:What's that? Oh, it's Benny the Bunny ( silly voice ): and his magic stethoscope.
OTHERMALE:I use it on the children.
LEADMALE:But don't worry, it works just like a real one.
OTHERMALE:( high-pitched scream ) You see what I mean? Either I have a defective bunny, or this man's heart has stopped.
LEADMALE:Mindy, I guess it's time we told him.
OTHERMALE:Daddy, we can't.
SUPMALE:We pro Well, we have to, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:It's his life.
LEADMALE:Tell me what? Doc, well You see, Doctor, he hasn't been here long.
SUPMALE:He's a He's an alien from another planet.
LEADMALE:Let me get this straight.
LEADMALE:You're trying to tell me that I have been examining a man with no heartbeat who has a temperature of 63 degrees and comes from another planet, hmm? You got it.
SUPFEMALE:I've got no time for practical jokes.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know how you tampered with my instruments, but my Mr.
SUPMALE:Mercury and my bunny were working before I came here.
SUPFEMALE:And nobody makes a fool of Dr.
SUPMALE:Ducky.
OTHERMALE:Daddy, what are we going to do? Oh honey, now take it easy, take it easy.
LEADFEMALE:Everything is going to be all right.
LEADMALE:I'll think of something.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess the only thing left is we'll just call an ambulance.
SUPMALE:See, I told you I'd think of something.
OTHERMALE:Now honey, everything is going to be all right.
OTHERFEMALE:The ambulance will be here in one minute, and don't worry about a thing.
LEADMALE:They'll run through every red light in Boulder to get here.
LEADMALE:Hello, this is an emergency.
SUPFEMALE:A man is dying.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I'll hold.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, he's gone! What? That-that's ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:Where did he go? Well maybe he went back to the apartment.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Let's check it out.
LEADFEMALE:Or he might have gone to that interview at the Vitamin Vendor.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why would he go there? He's only got an hour to live.
SUPMALE:Daddy, his mind isn't working right, and he's dying to get a job.
SUPMALE:Oh, why did I say that? Will you look at me? Look, if you can't handle drugs, don't do them, okay? What do you mean, I don't give a hoot? It's just ( doorbell tinkles ) Oh.
SUPMALE:we'll rap later.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Here about the job? No.
LEADFEMALE:What are they saying? I can dig your whole essence.
OTHERMALE:I can get right into your space where you're coming from and where you're at.
OTHERMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Is it quitting time? I don't feel too well.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe it's a nutrition thing.
LEADFEMALE:Like, maybe your potassium is in an imbalance with your blood sugar.
LEADMALE:You know, when that happens to me, I go straight for a Snickers bar.
LEADFEMALE:( doorbell tinkles ) There's a customer.
LEADMALE:Now I want to see you wait on him.
LEADMALE:How long should I wait? Time is money, and money is relative.
SUPFEMALE:Just see what he wants.
LEADMALE:Wow, reality what a concept.
LEADFEMALE:( quickly ): What do you want? Uh, do you have any wheat germ? I hope not.
LEADMALE:Everybody off! My doctor says that I need to get more iron.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, what do you suggest? Eat your car keys.
LEADMALE:Uh, do you have any clover honey? Oh, I'll check, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Never mind.
LEADFEMALE:I'll-I'll just get some vitamins.
LEADMALE:Um, I need some "A.
LEADMALE:" Aay! Uh, B-l2.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:( imitates airplane flying, speaks Japanese ) Too big for this store.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Miss? I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:My friend's biorhythms are the pits today.
LEADMALE:Look, could, uh, I just have a bottle of Vitamin "A"? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, will you go over there and get the bottle with the green pills? K.
SUPFEMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:So, anyway, I feel that in addition to vitamins, a person should get a lot of exercise.
LEADMALE:Like, I'm into transcendental tennis.
LEADFEMALE:Transcendental tennis? Yeah, we don't believe in actually hitting the ball.
SUPFEMALE:We just kind of relate to the Look, could you please hurry it up? ( slow motion ): Okay ( jabbering quickly ) ( pills falling on ground ) ( spastic groaning ) Shut up, Amy! I don't know if it was my fault! Here's one.
LEADMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:If this is what vitamins do to you, I'm going back to junk food.
OTHERFEMALE:( doorbell tinkles ) Thanks.
LEADMALE:Come again.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I think there's something really wrong with you.
LEADMALE:( quickly ): Oh, no, nothing's wrong with me.
LEADFEMALE:You see, everything's Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:Gleeks! Everything's brown gleeks! Everything's Brown Gleeks that's my favorite Rod McKuen album.
LEADMALE:Gleek! Recharge! Gleek! Mork.
LEADMALE:Mindy.
OTHERMALE:Rainbow.
LEADMALE:Gleek.
LEADMALE:Oh, help me get him to the car.
LEADMALE:He's really sick.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
LEADMALE:Not the Vitamin Bender, the Vitamin Vendor.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, that's "V" as in "vendor," "E" as in "ender," "N" as in "nn-der.
OTHERMALE:" Oh, I've been trying to reach you.
OTHERMALE:Why did you bring him here? I thought you'd take him straight to the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:He insisted on coming home.
SUPFEMALE:He says he has to find something.
LEADMALE:Something called gleek or Gleek! Gleek! ( imitates bloodhound barking ) ( barking stops ) ( barking resumes ) ( moans ) Oh, oh.
SUPFEMALE:Got him? Yes.
LEADMALE:All right, let's get him to the couch.
SUPMALE:Easy.
LEADMALE:Oh Right on the couch.
SUPFEMALE:Gleek.
LEADFEMALE:Need gleek.
LEADFEMALE:We've got to find out what a gleek is.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:What time is it? Uh, it-it's almost 1:30.
LEADMALE:( groans ) Oh! Oh! If we don't find out in ten more minutes, he doesn't stand a chance.
LEADFEMALE:Chants? On, no.
SUPMALE:( chanting ): Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna FRED: Uh, Mork, come on now.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, settle down.
SUPFEMALE:Take it easy, Mork.
SUPMALE:( snorts, squeaks ) Mork, remember you're sick.
OTHERMALE:Come here.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, there goes my sense of direction.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERMALE:( mumbling ) Grab him.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:I saw this once in a TV show.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! It worked.
LEADMALE:Mork, you've got to help us.
LEADFEMALE:What is wrong with you? It's my birthday.
LEADMALE:( gasps ): Oh no, it's his birthday! What's wrong with having a birthday? I don't know.
LEADMALE:What is wrong with having your birthday? On Ork, a birthday comes only every 2,000 zymes.
SUPMALE:When it does, our bodies go shazbot, and we get the gorgles.
LEADMALE:Gorgles? Are these gorgles contagious? On, no.
SUPFEMALE:There just like what you earthlings call dying.
SUPMALE:( gasps ) Mork, you have got to tell us what a gleek is.
SUPFEMALE:( slowly, slurring ): Energy source.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Recharge.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, what does it look like? ( speaking slowly and unintelligibly ) Oh, no.
SUPMALE:Now his voice is going.
LEADMALE:Mork, you've got to tell us what a gleek looks like! Give us a clue.
LEADMALE:How big is it? ( mumbling ) ( clucking ) I think he's trying to tell us something.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I feel like I'm in a Lassie movie.
SUPFEMALE:( clucking and squawking ) A-A gleek is a-a chicken? ( squawking ) ( clucking ) It's a bald chicken.
LEADFEMALE:A bald chicken.
SUPFEMALE:N-No, no.
SUPMALE:An egghead.
LEADMALE:It's an egghead! ( squawks ) It's an egg.
SUPFEMALE:A gleek is an egg.
LEADMALE:It's an egg.
SUPFEMALE:( squawking ) I know.
SUPFEMALE:I found an egg I found an egg on the counter this morning, and I put it in the refrigerator.
LEADMALE:Okay, now Mork, Mork, look, don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:After you get your gleek, your gorgles will be gone.
LEADMALE:I can't believe I said that.
LEADMALE:Mork, which one is it? Yeah, come on.
SUPMALE:( weakly mumbling ) Uh, gleek.
LEADMALE:Oh! Gleek.
SUPFEMALE:Let me get something straight.
LEADMALE:He's from a more advanced society? Gleek! Gleek! Gleek! Gleek! Oh! Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Gleek! Gleek! Gleek! ( beeping ) Gleek! Mork? Oh, Mork.
SUPMALE:( grunting ) Greetings.
SUPFEMALE:Any calls for me while I was out? Oh! MORK: Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:ORSON: Did you make it through your birthday, Mork? Oh yes, sir, but they threw a very strange ceremony for me.
OTHERMALE:You see, Mindy made me a cake, and then it caught on fire.
SUPFEMALE:What did you do? You know me, sir, semper paratus.
LEADMALE:I stomped that sucker right out, boy.
SUPMALE:Ha, ha! Good work, Mork.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, sir.
SUPMALE:Well, now that you're getting older, you're going to have to settle down.
SUPFEMALE:Since I've been on Earth, I'm not a bleemager anymore.
LEADMALE:Does that mean I have to get boring? Not boring, Mork, just more like me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'd better keep having those zeppelins for breakfast then.
SUPMALE:( honking bark ) I mean it.
LEADMALE:Stop acting like a child.
LEADFEMALE:You have to start calming down.
LEADMALE:Au contraire, Mon Grandiose.
LEADMALE:The dullest people on Earth are the ones who think that they have to calm down and set a pattern for themselves as they grow older.
LEADMALE:And that pattern dictates what they should be.
SUPMALE:It gives them very little freedom to be who they are.
LEADFEMALE:But everyone knows that as you grow older, you become more serious.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, but isn't it true, sir, no matter how many years you have, you have to keep just a touch of the child in you? A little bit of the "mondo bozo.
SUPFEMALE:" And you never feel old.
SUPFEMALE:So until next week, this is Mork signing off.
SUPMALE:Nanu-nanu.
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Re
SUPFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
SUPMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! ( trumpet plays off-key ) Stop it! Stop! Mork, your lesson is officially over.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Hudson? I want to get to the part where I get to go ( imitates Louis Armstrong ): "Oh, yeah!" Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Why, what's the matter, dear? Oh, I've been having a hard time finding a part-time job that goes along with my journalism major, so I've been pounding the pavement all morning.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you shouldn't do that.
SUPMALE:You might wake up the Chinese.
LEADFEMALE:With the war going the way it is, they need a lot of sleep.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, I've been to newspapers and ad agencies and publishing companies, and they all say that I'm either too young or I don't have enough experience.
LEADMALE:And one place wouldn't give me a job because they said I was a woman.
LEADFEMALE:Well, next time, don't tell them.
LEADMALE:Well, dear, I'm sure there's a businessman somewhere who would be glad to get hold of a young, eager woman.
LEADMALE:Oh, there's plenty of those.
LEADFEMALE:Except my major's journalism, not fooling around.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Fooling around can be fun.
LEADMALE:Watch.
LEADFEMALE:( squealing and grunting ) Mork Come on, this is important to me! Oh.
SUPMALE:Boy, I've really blown it again.
LEADFEMALE:Now I've got a right to play the blues.
SUPMALE:( plays note ) Excuse me, sir.
LEADMALE:Ma'am? I'm looking for someone to give music lessons to my son.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you came to the right place.
SUPFEMALE:That woman over there taught me everything I know.
LEADFEMALE:( plays screeching notes ) No! ( plays tunelessly ) Mork! Mork, please, I make my living from teaching music.
SUPMALE:Oh, right now I feel like a light bulb in the Buckingham Palace.
OTHERMALE:What? A royal screw-up.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Hudson.
SUPFEMALE:Well, sorry doesn't pay the rent.
LEADMALE:Uh Mindy? Hmm? Why is this job so important to you? Well, journalism courses are one thing, but I'd like to get out in the real world and write something good you know, something that will really excite people.
LEADMALE:Why not try "For a good time, call Mindy.
LEADMALE:" ( laughs ) Oh, hi, honey.
SUPFEMALE:You're looking very pretty today.
LEADFEMALE:Prettier than ever.
LEADFEMALE:Good to see you, Mork.
SUPMALE:Love your suspenders.
LEADFEMALE:I'd give them to you, Pop, except my voice would ( in deep voice ): change.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ) Well, you certainly are in a good mood today.
LEADFEMALE:Who was that on the phone? I've met the kind of woman every man dreams about.
LEADFEMALE:She's sophisticated, yet young at heart.
LEADMALE:She's independent, yet vulnerable.
LEADFEMALE:And she has a certain je ne sais quoi.
LEADMALE:Qu'est-ce que c'est, "Je ne sais quoi?" A figure that would stop a truck.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Fat city, huh? Well, I've never heard you talk like this.
LEADMALE:You sound like you're really smitten.
LEADMALE:Sounds like he's beyond smitten and into smut.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, cool it! No, that's all right.
LEADMALE:When I'm feeling this good, he can say anything he wants to.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thanks, skinhead.
OTHERFEMALE:I've, um I've bought Margaret a little present.
LEADFEMALE:Take a look.
SUPFEMALE:I've got it right here.
LEADFEMALE:I hope she likes it.
LEADFEMALE:Now what do you think? Wow! One for each day of the week.
LEADMALE:How come there are only six of them? Sundays we rest! Oh, I read you, Pop.
LEADFEMALE:Oh-ho! Yada, yada, yada, yada.
SUPMALE:Hey, Dad, tell you what.
LEADMALE:Why don't you invite Margaret to dinner at my house tomorrow night? If she's not that busy Too busy? For the man she calls "Ol' Tiger Lips"? Listen, when I go like this, she jumps! Well, I can't wait to meet the woman who finds you so fascinating.
LEADMALE:Oh, actually, she's the one who's fascinating.
SUPMALE:She was just appointed editor of Rocky Mountain Illustrated.
LEADMALE:No kidding? She's an editor? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I'll make a great roast beef and spell my resume out in niblets.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and I'll provide the dinner music.
LEADFEMALE:Watch.
LEADMALE:( plays high, off-key notes ) Why don't we have our coffee in the living room? Uh more vino, Margaret? Oh, thank you, Fred.
OTHERMALE:Ahh Here let me help you up.
LEADMALE:Mork, do you want some coffee? No, thank you, ma'am.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you've been awfully quiet tonight.
LEADMALE:Yes, sir, with all due respect.
LEADMALE:You certainly have nice manners.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thank you, ma'am, but I was told if I didn't, I'd be blowing succotash out my nose.
LEADMALE:He's such a kidder.
SUPMALE:So, Margaret, I'm really excited about your offer.
SUPFEMALE:I can't tell you how hard I've been looking for a job.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I always try to encourage young writers, and I'd especially like to help you.
SUPMALE:You're exactly like your father described you.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you.
OTHERMALE:MORK: That's funny.
LEADFEMALE:You're not at all like he described you.
OTHERFEMALE:I was expecting a big brake pedal.
LEADMALE:What? Well, he said you had a figure that could stop a truck.
OTHERFEMALE:( chuckles ) Why thank you, Fred.
LEADMALE:Oh, I think what Mork is trying to say is that my father finds you very attractive.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, yes, that's it.
SUPMALE:I guess you're the only one that can do it.
LEADFEMALE:Do what? Well, he says whenever he does this, you jump.
LEADMALE:Come on, you can do it.
LEADFEMALE:Up, up.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Through the hoop.
SUPFEMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Mork! ( whistles ) Mork! Oh, I guess your thighs are tired.
LEADMALE:You'd better give those little suckers a rest, then.
LEADFEMALE:Well Margaret, I-I just really want to thank you again for inviting me by your office tomorrow.
LEADMALE:MORK: It's nice of you to give Mindy a job even though she's a woman.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what's wrong with being a woman? Mindy says it's hard for a woman to get a job unless she fools around.
OTHERMALE:Well, it so happens, Mindy, that some of us are quite successful solely because of our ability.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:I mean, who would want to fool around with Margaret? Oh, really? Oh, I mean I mean That's not what I meant.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes things uh come out the way I didn't mean them.
LEADMALE:Well, you're doing awfully good for a man with tiger lips.
LEADFEMALE:Tiger lips? You told them? I suppose you told them about "Let's Play Circus," too? And "Bambi Bottom"! Ooh, soft, whoa.
OTHERFEMALE:I think I've heard enough.
OTHERMALE:I'm leaving.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Margaret! Margaret! And about that interview, Mindy sorry, we're only hiring men.
LEADMALE:FRED: N-N-No, wait! Wait! Bambi! Cute couple.
SUPMALE:Anything I can do to help? Help?! Haven't you done enough already? In one night, you have ruined my father's life, and you've ruined my life.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, Mork, sometimes I just wish you'd mind your own business! ( door slams ) Mork calling Orson Come in, Orson Mork calling Orson Come in, Orson Mork calling Orson Come in, Orson You're lucky to catch me in, Mork.
LEADMALE:You're calling at the wrong time.
LEADMALE:That figures, sir.
SUPMALE:I can't seem to do anything right recently.
SUPMALE:That's why I want to come home, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Why? I thought you like it down there.
LEADMALE:No, sir, I don't seem to fit in very well.
LEADMALE:It seems that no matter how hard I try, I keep lousing up the lives of the people I care for.
LEADFEMALE:I've got to come home, sir.
SUPMALE:I'm-I'm pig slop.
OTHERMALE:I want you to stay there and keep sending back those reports about Earth behavior.
LEADFEMALE:It's no use, sir.
LEADMALE:I've goofed up the entire year I've been here, and I want to leave before I cause serious damage to someone's life.
LEADMALE:I'm-I'm worm sweat.
SUPFEMALE:I think you're being a little hard on yourself, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, not at all, sir.
SUPMALE:It's just that I'm bean dip, and I've got to come home.
LEADFEMALE:Well, perhaps.
SUPMALE:But let's make sure.
SUPMALE:If you don't mind submitting yourself to the Plasmic Essence Reversifier.
LEADMALE:Oh, that sounds wonderful, sir.
LEADFEMALE:I'd love it! What is it? A newly developed process which will enable you to see what paths your friends would have taken the past year, had you not come into their lives.
LEADMALE:I know what that'd be.
LEADMALE:They'd be better off without me.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you see for yourself? You will merely be an observer unable to be seen or heard.
LEADMALE:When I activate the Reversifier, the entire year of your experiences on Earth will be erased.
SUPFEMALE:All right, sir.
SUPFEMALE:I'm ready.
LEADMALE:Rub me out.
LEADFEMALE:I'm putting you on rewind.
LEADMALE:( mumbling backwards ) ( echoing voice ): Whoa, talk about your reruns.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy! Mindy! It's me.
OTHERMALE:Mork! Oh-ho! Mindy, Mindy Mindy! It's Morko, the pinheaded boy.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha! I'm home.
LEADMALE:( honking bark ) ( whistles ) Fun's fun, joke's over.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:( imitates humming whoosh ) Guess Orson's right.
SUPFEMALE:She can't see me or hear me.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe she can feel me.
SUPFEMALE:I'll give her a tickle.
LEADMALE:She always used to love that.
SUPMALE:Ooh, I guess I'm not here, so she can't even feel me.
LEADMALE:It's too bad, she was always a great tickle.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, Frederick's had a sale.
SUPMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm home.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Oh, a ring! Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy's married.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I was right.
OTHERMALE:Mindy'd be awfully happy without me here.
OTHERMALE:Get me a beer, will you? Sure, honey.
LEADMALE:I'm really anxious to hear about your big day.
SUPMALE:Yeah, me, too.
LEADMALE:Who is that, Mindy? Oh, I remember.
SUPFEMALE:That was your blind date.
LEADMALE:He came over and I was going to stick around with you so he wouldn't bump into things.
LEADFEMALE:He never saw you again.
LEADMALE:( honking bark ) I guess old Mork the home wrecker would have prevented you from getting married.
SUPMALE:Here you go.
SUPMALE:Now tell me everything.
LEADFEMALE:I want to hear all about it.
LEADMALE:Look, I need a little time to unwind, huh? Oh, sure.
LEADMALE:I'll help.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:I guess there's no need for this Orkan around here anymore.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going miss you, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd give you a hug but I can't.
LEADMALE:Take care.
OTHERMALE:If you ever need me, just whistle.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Well, I might as well tell you.
LEADMALE:You're going to find out anyway.
SUPMALE:I was fired.
LEADMALE:Well, what happened this time? Oh, a thorn in the bed of roses.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it wasn't my fault.
LEADMALE:You see, I owed Red, my bookie, a couple of bucks, so he repossessed the company car.
SUPMALE:My boss resented it.
LEADFEMALE:Cliff, you promised that you were going to try and quit gambling.
LEADMALE:So what's the big deal? You've got two jobs.
LEADFEMALE:Two jobs? Oh, that's wonderful, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:You're pursuing your writing career.
LEADMALE:That's fantastic.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's another reason why you don't need me around.
LEADFEMALE:Ciao.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think that I like being a salesgirl and a cocktail waitress? Wiping fingerprints off of a counter during the day and off of this at night? When do you have time to write? And then all my money goes to pay off your gambling debts.
LEADFEMALE:You know, we could have had a house by now.
LEADMALE:Buzz off, huh? Do you know what you are? I'll tell him.
LEADFEMALE:You're You're a toad tush! You're scuttle butt! You're whale whiz! Come on, come on, come on.
SUPFEMALE:What? Forget it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, Mindy, use your imagination.
LEADMALE:At least call him moose mush.
OTHERFEMALE:I've had enough.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I've had enough of you, too, mildew mouth.
LEADMALE:Come on out here! Cliff.
LEADMALE:Come on out here, clown! I'll zap you! Oh, Mindy, this wouldn't happen if I was around.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I'd nail him.
LEADFEMALE:I'd stick my finger down his throat and weld his tonsils together.
SUPFEMALE:If he tried to give you any lip, it'd sound like ( garbled noises ).
OTHERFEMALE:CLIFF: Can you get down off that bed and stop playing with that stupid ball of yarn! Look at the good side, at least you have a pet.
LEADFEMALE:CORA: I'm going.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Hudson's your pet? She's cute, and she can't kill birds.
SUPMALE:That's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Are you all right, Grandma? Oh, yes, dear.
LEADMALE:I was just sitting there knitting like I always do.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm knitting a new shawl for Iran.
LEADFEMALE:( Cliff screams in pain ) Oh, that's where I left that other needle.
SUPMALE:( knocking at door ) I'll get that.
SUPFEMALE:Hello! Daddy! When did you get back in town? Tonight.
SUPMALE:Oh, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:Freddy! Oh, Cora.
LEADMALE:Oh, Freddy.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe you changed this much in eight months! Whoa! Everyone run for your lives! It's the invasion of the scalp snatchers! Hide your noses, everyone.
SUPFEMALE:Hide your noses.
OTHERFEMALE:So, how was Europe? C'est magnifique.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:And where's my favorite son-in-law, Cliff, huh? Don't ask.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, he's probably taking a nap or something.
SUPMALE:Oh, I understand.
LEADMALE:He probably worked hard all day.
OTHERMALE:You're in for a big surprise.
OTHERFEMALE:( snores ) Honey, I was so happy when you got married.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it looks like even you can be happy without my being here.
LEADMALE:You have a wonderful husband, and Cora has a home where she's welcome and loved, and I could finally sell the house and the store and get out and see the world and grab for some gusto.
OTHERFEMALE:I decided it was time to catch up on the life of a single man.
LEADFEMALE:So I flew to the Continent, and I met Veronica.
SUPMALE:( whistles ) Veronica? Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:A former Miss Teenage Bulgaria.
OTHERMALE:Ah, she was the kind of woman every man dreams of.
SUPFEMALE:She had a certain je ne sais quoi.
LEADMALE:I can translate for you.
SUPMALE:( guttural ): "I like you.
LEADFEMALE:" The times we spent together, dancing till dawn ( guitar playing ) champagne suppers on the strand, ( popping sound ) and sailing into the sunset.
LEADFEMALE:( beeping ) Dive! Dive! Dive! ( honking bark ) Mindy, where's dinner? Oh, the plot clots.
LEADMALE:Cliff! Son, how are you? Oh, look who's back.
LEADMALE:You going to live here, too? I used to, but now things have Look, if you don't have dinner ready, I'm going to Red's place.
LEADFEMALE:Give me some money.
LEADFEMALE:No, don't, Mind No, Cliff, you're just going to gamble it away anyway, and right now we need every penny we can get.
LEADMALE:I'll get it myself.
SUPMALE:Where's your wallet? No, no, wait.
LEADMALE:Keep away from that.
SUPMALE:Don't do No, keep your hands off her tips! Stop thief! Stop! Good-bye, Cliff.
LEADFEMALE:Hope you fall off your name.
LEADFEMALE:I had no idea.
LEADMALE:Oh, today's one of his good days.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Maybe I should go and talk to him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, Pops, don't do that.
LEADMALE:You don't want footprints on your new rug again, do you? Where is this Red's place? Oh, it's a bookie joint.
SUPMALE:You can't miss it.
LEADFEMALE:It used to be the music store.
LEADFEMALE:Things sure have changed.
LEADMALE:It's too bad.
LEADFEMALE:Can I do anything to help you, dear? No, thanks, Grandma.
OTHERMALE:I'd just like to be alone for awhile.
LEADMALE:Well, if you have someone nearby, dear, who loves you, you'll never be alone.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what a McKuen-like thing to say, Grandma.
SUPFEMALE:I'll go booby- trap the bed.
LEADMALE:Now let's see.
LEADFEMALE:Cliff sleeps on the right side, yes.
LEADMALE:( crying ) Oh, don't cry.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want to see your eyes leaking.
LEADMALE:Don't cry, it's not the end of the world.
LEADMALE:That comes in the year 2118 when the giant bees come.
LEADFEMALE:And Regis Philbin is elected President of the United States.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy, come on.
LEADMALE:I got a joke.
LEADFEMALE:Here's something to cheer you up.
LEADFEMALE:Knock, knock.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, bad choice, huh? Wait, Mind.
SUPMALE:Come on, don't be sad.
SUPMALE:Hey, listen, here's a joke.
SUPMALE:What do you get when you cross a German Shepherd and a giraffe? A watchdog for the eighth floor.
LEADFEMALE:All right, here's another one, okay.
LEADMALE:Why did Einstein throw his brother's clock out the window? He wanted to see relative time.
LEADMALE:( honking bark ) Come on, Mind, they laugh at this on Mercury, and they don't even have mouths.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mindy.
SUPMALE:Wait, look.
LEADMALE:Look at this.
OTHERMALE:A little Martian yarmulke.
LEADMALE:( speaks gibberish ) Oh, look.
LEADFEMALE:Look.
SUPFEMALE:Mick Jagger.
SUPFEMALE:Talk about your midnight rambler.
OTHERMALE:( crying ) Oh, Mind, hey, don't cry.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, you wouldn't be crying if I was here.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:There's no reason to cry.
OTHERMALE:Here's your wallet.
LEADMALE:Oh, thanks, Pop.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, Dad.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, honey, take it easy.
LEADMALE:Come on, let's go sit down and have a heart-to-heart talk.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sweetheart I have a confession to make.
LEADFEMALE:I'm alone, too.
LEADMALE:Veronica lasted just as long as my money, which wasn't very long.
OTHERMALE:Well, you still have me.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
SUPMALE:Well I guess I won't be needing this anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Or the lies that went with it.
SUPMALE:I can't understand it.
LEADMALE:Cliff seemed to have so much promise.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, he did till he started gambling, and it just sort of took over his life.
LEADFEMALE:And now he's he's willing to gamble on anything but us.
LEADMALE:You know, I'd always hoped you'd meet someone who was mature responsible, independent.
LEADFEMALE:( fife playing ) Yet somebody who was, mm, easygoing.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, say, what's happening, man? What's happening? Carefree.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Lah.
LEADMALE:And somebody who was full of life.
LEADMALE:The most important thing to me is somebody who can make me laugh.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mindy, I used to be able to make you laugh.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, remember.
LEADFEMALE:( makes musical sounds ) You know what I'd like to do? Let's go for a walk the way we used to.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like that.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Let's all go.
LEADMALE:( thunder rumbling ) Oh, honey, look.
SUPFEMALE:It's starting to rain.
OTHERMALE:That's okay.
LEADMALE:I like walking in the rain.
LEADFEMALE:That way nobody can tell if you're crying.
LEADFEMALE:( thunder rumbles ) I can ( sniffles ) ( sustained tone ) Orson, I've seen enough.
LEADMALE:I don't want her to end up like this.
LEADMALE:Please, bring me back to now.
SUPMALE:Mork, I have to talk to you.
OTHERMALE:You have to talk to me? Really? You can see me? Whoa, it's a wonderful life! Mork Ha-ha! She touched me.
LEADFEMALE:Yazoo yazoo! Mork, I want to apologize for snapping at you a minute ago.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, you can be mean and nasty any time you want.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, I can't.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, you can, you can, you can, you can, you can, can, can, can.
LEADFEMALE:You see you have to be patient with me.
LEADFEMALE:I was upset because I thought I'd lost a job.
SUPMALE:But I'd rather lose a hundred jobs than a friend like you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, listen, I'm new at this, and I've got a lot to learn, but if anyone's going to mess up your life, I hope for your sake, it's me.
LEADMALE:( laughs softly ) Oh.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha, ha, har, ar.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh, that reminds me of a joke.
LEADMALE:What do you get when you cross a German Shepherd and a giraffe? A watchdog for the eighth floor.
SUPMALE:How did you know that? I'm not sure.
OTHERMALE:( hums Twilight Zone theme ) Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson Come in, Your Fattitude Yow, baby, get down ( scatting ) I'll be with you in a moment, Mork.
SUPMALE:There's a caller on another brain cell.
LEADFEMALE:I'll hold.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, what is it? Sorry, there's no one named Juanita here.
LEADMALE:Juanita no en la casa.
LEADFEMALE:Good-bye.
LEADFEMALE:I'd love to know who had this brain before me.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds like Ricardo Montalban.
LEADFEMALE:Sir, you'll never guess what I learned.
LEADMALE:You'll never guess.
OTHERMALE:Go on, take one guess.
LEADMALE:Too late! Okay, I'll tell you.
LEADMALE:I learned that I'm okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not as bad as I thought I was.
LEADMALE:That's a lesson one can only learn from the School of Oneself.
LEADMALE:Wow, what a Werner-like thing to say.
OTHERFEMALE:But you know something, Orson? I'd like to thank you for letting me see what Mindy's life would be like without me.
LEADMALE:But please, I never want to see what my life would be like without her.
LEADMALE:You know, Mork, I think you're beginning to grow.
OTHERMALE:Well, sir, I don't know how much value I have in this universe, but I do know that I made a few people happier than they would've been without me, and as long as I know that, I'm as rich as I ever need to be.
LEADFEMALE:So I'll catch you on the rebound, Your Magnitude.
LEADFEMALE:Until next week.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu, nanu.
OTHERFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! ( theme song playing ) Mindy? What? Guess what followed me home? What followed you home? Can I keep it, huh, Mindy, huh? ( whistles ) Can I, hmm? This is one of those questions I always dread.
LEADFEMALE:All right, what is it? It's real cute.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:It's fuzzy.
SUPMALE:Mm-hmm.
SUPFEMALE:It's about this tall.
SUPMALE:A dog that's been run over by a truck? Oh, Mindy, that's so sick.
SUPFEMALE:Squashed dogs can't follow you home.
SUPFEMALE:Look.
LEADMALE:It's a kittypiller! Oh, that's a caterpillar.
SUPFEMALE:Not for a few weeks yet, it hasn't got hair on its chest.
SUPFEMALE:No, they're always called caterpillars.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, idiot moi.
LEADFEMALE:Well, does it have a name yet? Well, I like to call her Bob.
SUPMALE:See? She looked up when I said her name.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that end isn't her head.
LEADFEMALE:Really? I thought she was smiling at me.
SUPFEMALE:Here we go, Bob.
LEADFEMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:Go for a walk in the candy dish.
LEADFEMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I hope you're not hypoglycemic.
SUPFEMALE:So, Mork, a caterpillar followed you home, huh? Yeah, I had to walk real slow and like this.
OTHERMALE:How do you know that it's a girl? Are you kidding, with a body like that? Well, I think you have a lovely insect and you two do make a lovely couple, but I have a French class tonight and I'm going to go change my clothes.
LEADMALE:Oh, why don't you show Bob the rest of the house.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, Bob, don't get mad.
LEADMALE:It's all right.
LEADMALE:You'll get to like Mindy once you get to know her.
SUPFEMALE:She's just a little jealous.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, she doesn't have a fur coat like yours.
SUPMALE:Well, now that we're here, let's relax.
SUPMALE:Sit down.
LEADMALE:Put your feet up.
LEADFEMALE:Put your feet up.
SUPMALE:Put your feet up.
OTHERFEMALE:Put your feet up.
SUPMALE:( knocking on door ) I'll be right back, my petite fuzz.
LEADMALE:Un moment.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you slip into something more silky.
SUPFEMALE:Ar-ark! Mork! Exidor! In this life, yes.
SUPFEMALE:Do you mind? We're having a private conversation.
LEADMALE:I told you guys to wait on the moped.
LEADFEMALE:Get out! Entourages can be the pits.
LEADFEMALE:Exidor, come in.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down.
SUPFEMALE:I'd like you to meet my insect.
OTHERMALE:Plenty of time for that later.
SUPFEMALE:Mork I have come here to preach the only true religion.
OTHERFEMALE:What's the only true religion this time? Reincarnation! We have all lived before, and we shall all be born again.
LEADMALE:Oh, the ultimate dÃ©jÃ  vu.
SUPMALE:In a previous life, I was a very famous person.
LEADMALE:Guess who.
LEADMALE:Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party? Just to meet girls.
SUPFEMALE:Are you currently in a Broadway show? No.
SUPFEMALE:Are you bigger than a bread box? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:I got it.
SUPFEMALE:You're the editor of the National Enquirer.
LEADMALE:He's not dead.
LEADFEMALE:I can wait.
SUPMALE:I'm surprised, Mork.
LEADMALE:I thought you'd guess.
SUPFEMALE:I was Julius Caesar.
LEADMALE:I had the little laurel leaves right around the ear.
LEADMALE:And if you look closely, you can even see a little mulch.
LEADMALE:You were Julius Caesar? Absolutely.
SUPFEMALE:I know because I get stabbing pains every Ides of March.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Then you'll enjoy meeting my new friend, Bob.
LEADMALE:You made friends with a fuzzy Tootsie Roll? No, it's, no, look closer.
LEADFEMALE:It's a caterpillar.
LEADFEMALE:Why, this is no ordinary caterpillar, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:This is the reincarnation of Abraham Lincoln! No! Yes! How can you tell? Is that the face of someone who would tolerate slavery? That's not her face.
LEADFEMALE:Really? I thought she was smiling at me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I have to be going, but don't worry, Mork, I'll be coming back if you get my drift.
LEADMALE:Mork I know her.
OTHERFEMALE:Cleopatra! It's me, Julie! What? How quickly they forget.
LEADFEMALE:Those robes somehow look strangely familiar.
OTHERMALE:They ought to be after what you and Marc Antony did to him.
SUPFEMALE:You and that asp of yours.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Mork, between your friends and your pets, I sometimes wonder if you're an advanced alien being, or just an intergalactic bozo.
OTHERMALE:The answer is ( mimics computer beeps ) Both! Oh, look Mindy, Bob's hungry.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have anything green in the ice box? Hmm last month's cottage cheese.
LEADMALE:Oh, leafy green is better than lumpy green, but I'll give it a try.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I'm going to be late for class.
OTHERFEMALE:I've got to go.
SUPMALE:Hey, maybe you can get something from Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley.
LEADMALE:No, I've already had my shots.
LEADMALE:I mean food, silly.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:I'll see you later.
SUPMALE:You have a bug for a pet? Oh, yes.
SUPFEMALE:I pulled a thorn out of his paw and the other 13 legs followed me home.
LEADMALE:Nobody has a bug for a pet.
LEADMALE:Are you kidding? Bob's clean.
SUPMALE:She's leaf-broken.
LEADMALE:She's a skilled mime, too.
LEADMALE:Bob, do your "Caterpillar Walking Against the Wind.
OTHERMALE:" Bugs can't do diddly.
SUPFEMALE:Now, a dog is something you can train.
SUPMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:Bickie, oh, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Bickie can do lots of tricks.
LEADFEMALE:You can train him to do anything.
SUPMALE:Look, he can wave.
LEADMALE:Wave, Bickie.
OTHERMALE:He can salute.
LEADMALE:He can pledge allegiance Oh, yeah? Bob can pledge allegiance to 14 countries at once! Bickie can sit up and beg.
OTHERMALE:Well, Bob doesn't have to.
LEADFEMALE:She's independently wealthy.
SUPMALE:That's stupid.
SUPMALE:If you put that thing on the rug, it would look like a cigarette burn.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a busy man.
LEADMALE:I'm having my dinner and I don't have to sit around and listen while you try to convince me that your insipid bug is superior to my stupid dog.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really? You shouldn't have said that.
LEADFEMALE:Bob, no! Bob, no! Down, Bob! Down, Bob! I don't want to listen to any more of this inane conversation about insects.
LEADMALE:Are you implying that you want me to bug off? Right.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you realize, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley, that you're being awfully cruel.
OTHERMALE:You're hurting the feelings of another life-form.
SUPMALE:Okay, I'll be good.
LEADFEMALE:Your pet, Bob, has one worthwhile use.
LEADFEMALE:What's that? He'd make a great bookmark.
LEADMALE:Oh MINDY: Where is the "other woman"? Shh.
SUPFEMALE:She's asleep.
LEADMALE:In a brand-new, combination log cabin and condominium.
OTHERFEMALE:See? I built her a little hot tub and some lawn furniture.
LEADMALE:Here's a little chaise lounge and inside, she has a beetle for a chauffeur, a dragonfly for a hairdresser.
LEADFEMALE:She's got a little vicious watch-ant to protect her property, see? It always goes for the toes.
LEADMALE:( squeaking ): Nyah, nyah! And tomorrow I'm going to take her to the movie The Swarm, because Bob says she knows one of the stunt bees personally.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you certainly are being nice to her, Mork.
LEADMALE:I can see why she looks up to you.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, Bob looks up to everybody.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but not everybody's that nice to their pet.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I know.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow I'm going to take her for a crawl.
LEADFEMALE:Now, where would you take a caterpillar for a crawl? Well, she loves the outdoors, so that's why I'm taking her to your philodendron so she can feel a little dirt between her toes and crawl softly and slowly.
OTHERFEMALE:So, how's that French class of yours? Comme ci, comme Ã§a.
SUPFEMALE:What's that mean? ( imitates Mork ): Eeh-eh, eeh-eh.
SUPMALE:Did you hear that, Bob? Comme ci, comme Ã§a means eeh-eh.
LEADFEMALE:I do that, too.
SUPMALE:Bob, you got to wake up now, sleepyhead.
LEADMALE:Come on, you can't sleep your whole life away.
LEADFEMALE:Time for a little Yoga.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Bob! Nova! Come on, Bob.
SUPFEMALE:Bob What are you doing? I'm giving her cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
OTHERMALE:It's too late.
LEADMALE:Bob's dead.
OTHERMALE:Ooh Oh, she was so young, so beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:She had so much to live for.
OTHERFEMALE:I was going to buy her those ballet shoes.
LEADMALE:Mork, even caterpillars have to die.
SUPFEMALE:There's one last hope.
LEADFEMALE:Exidor's coming in a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Why did you call him? Maybe he can bring Bob back.
SUPFEMALE:He's into reincarnation.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, you're just going to have to face the facts.
OTHERMALE:Bob is gone for good.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I know.
LEADMALE:I blame myself.
LEADMALE:I should have known she was sick when she looked up and went "Ug-Ugh!" Mork, it was only a bug! What?! All right, I didn't mean that, but it's not your fault that it died.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you're right.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, you're right.
LEADMALE:It was your fault, wasn't it? ( evil laughter ) Yeah, you were jealous, weren't you? You had better legs, but she had more of them.
OTHERFEMALE:Now that she's dead, you want to laugh! Well, go ahead.
LEADMALE:Awr-awr-awr-awr! Mork, what are you saying?! ( crying ): Oh, Mindy, Mindy, Oh Mindy! Oh Oh! If this is the emotion of grief, it really stinks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, I understand.
OTHERMALE:Earthlings feel the same way when a pet they love dies.
LEADFEMALE:Love ha! Who said it was love? It was just a stupid bug.
LEADFEMALE:I know what you're going through.
LEADFEMALE:I really do.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy, how could I say that about her? I worshipped the ground that she crawled on.
LEADMALE:Mork! I came over as soon as you called.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong? Abraham Lincoln's dead again.
LEADMALE:Um, excuse me, Mr.
SUPMALE:Exidor, but what exactly is it that you do? I'm a spirit migration engineer.
LEADMALE:You're a grave robber? No, that's a body migration engineer.
LEADFEMALE:( sobbing ): Oh oh, no.
LEADMALE:It's all right, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:We still have time.
SUPFEMALE:If we hurry, we can bring Bob back as a lower life-form.
SUPFEMALE:What's lower than a caterpillar? A caterpillar trainee.
LEADFEMALE:Oh How can we do that? The entire process has been formulated scientifically by Dr.
LEADMALE:Paul Kerns, Professor of Reincarnation at Colorado Tech.
LEADMALE:Well, as long as it's scientific.
LEADMALE:First, we'll do the magic incantation.
OTHERFEMALE:Repeat after me: Ohwah Ohwah Ta jer Ta jer Kiam.
LEADMALE:Kiam.
LEADFEMALE:Now repeat it quickly, Mork.
SUPMALE:Ohwah ta jer kiam.
SUPFEMALE:Ohwah ta jer kiam.
OTHERMALE:Oh, what a jerk I am.
LEADMALE:Oh, what a jerk Exidor, how can you make jokes at a time like this?! Mork, lighten up.
LEADMALE:You're always so serious.
LEADMALE:But Bob's dead.
LEADFEMALE:Not dead, just preparing her comeback.
LEADMALE:It's now time for the Ritual Reincarnation Boogie.
LEADFEMALE:Arise, oh, defunct creepy crawler! Arise, oh, many-legged cadaver! Well, that's that.
SUPMALE:What's what? Nothing happened! Oh, that's a shocker.
OTHERFEMALE:Bob has been reincarnated as a cow.
SUPMALE:That's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:No, that's terrible! He'll be eaten.
LEADFEMALE:No, she's safe.
SUPFEMALE:She's in India.
LEADFEMALE:She's sacred.
LEADFEMALE:( Indian accent ): Holy cow.
SUPMALE:Remember to call me if anybody else you love dies.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, thanks so much for everything.
LEADFEMALE:You used to have the best barge in Egypt.
LEADMALE:Hey, you kids, get away from that mule! Mindy, I know.
OTHERMALE:Sometimes Exidor can have Swiss cheese for brains, but tell me the truth, Bob's gone forever, isn't she? Yes.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, what do you Earthlings do when your pets die? Oh, well, usually we have a little funeral and then flush them down I mean, uh, we we bury them.
SUPMALE:We can do that for Bob, then, can we? Sure we can, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:We'll talk about it tomorrow, okay? Oh, thanks, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Well, I'd better get started.
LEADMALE:Started doing what? Well, it's the least I can do.
LEADMALE:I've got to notify the 86 million next of kin.
SUPFEMALE:( mimics insect buzzing ) Bob is dead.
OTHERFEMALE:Pass it on.
OTHERMALE:( buzzing ) How about late August? Yeah, yeah, it's usually pretty dead around here then.
LEADMALE:Oh I'll talk to you later, Jim.
LEADFEMALE:Just got a vertical.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:May I be of assistance? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Is this the place where you bring the dead? Those who have passed into spirit are always welcome here.
LEADMALE:I don't know if she passed into spirit, but she sure croaked.
LEADMALE:Yes, well, you are in the right place.
SUPMALE:Please, uh, sit down, won't you? Now, was the deceased a relative of yours? No.
SUPFEMALE:I only knew her a few days.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're very kind to be making arrangements for her everlasting peace.
LEADMALE:Well, it's the least I could do; we lived together.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I see.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, not to worry.
LEADMALE:We here at the Herman Funeral Home, we don't make judgments on our clients' lifestyles.
LEADFEMALE:What was her name? Bob.
SUPMALE:I see.
SUPMALE:And the last name? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Last names weren't important to us.
LEADMALE:I can imagine.
SUPMALE:Well now, I would only assume that you would want Bob to have the best.
LEADFEMALE:That sounds wonderful.
OTHERMALE:Now, what would you like for an epitaph? Well, I could start off with a shrimp cocktail, have some espresso ( sighs ) No, I mean what would you like written on the headstone? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Here lies Bob.
OTHERFEMALE:She's dead.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a beautiful sentiment.
SUPFEMALE:And totally accurate.
LEADMALE:Now, let's see.
SUPFEMALE:Adding on a simple wreath, a small spray of flowers, pallbearers, basic ceremony and a compact hearse That comes to $2,800.
LEADMALE:For what? For the funeral, the expenses.
SUPFEMALE:You mean it costs money to die? Only if you want to die decently.
SUPMALE:Bob died great.
LEADMALE:And nothing you can do will make her feel any better.
LEADMALE:But the point is to make you feel better.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, the only way I'll feel better is if Bob stayed with me forever and ever.
OTHERFEMALE:And that's exactly what I'm going to do keep her with me in my room.
OTHERFEMALE:Keep her with you in your BICKLEY: Some cocktail party.
LEADFEMALE:Where's the pretzels? What are you talking about? Mork sent me this card saying he was having a cocktail party.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I knew you wouldn't come if I told you it was a funeral.
OTHERFEMALE:A funeral? Who died? Our dear departed Bob.
SUPMALE:That caterpillar? I thought she keeled over weeks ago.
OTHERMALE:( exaggerated whimper ) Renewed sorrow! Anguish! And assorted other emotions.
SUPMALE:He's been keeping that thing in his pocket.
OTHERFEMALE:I finally convinced him it was time to put poor old Bob to rest.
LEADMALE:Well, if you'll excuse me Oh, no, please don't go, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Bickley.
LEADMALE:I don't go to bug wakes.
LEADMALE:Look, I know this sounds silly, but Mork really loved that bug.
LEADFEMALE:And besides, for afterwards, I got a bottle of your favorite snack.
LEADMALE:Oh, all right.
LEADFEMALE:But don't ask me to view the body.
LEADMALE:Please be seated.
LEADFEMALE:BICKLEY: Hey, what's this? I've never seen a casket that offers a course in computer programming.
LEADFEMALE:( clearing throat ) ( ostentatiously ): What can you say about a caterpillar? Bob was all that and more.
SUPMALE:She was a friend, a joy, an inspiration.
LEADMALE:Bob will never do the things she dreamed of now that she's stiff city.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not going to be easy to follow in her footsteps, but tomorrow, seven of us are going to try.
LEADMALE:All I have to say in closing is, "If you knew Bobbie like I knew Bobbie, oy, oy, oy, what a bug.
OTHERFEMALE:" And now to say a few words, a fine, upstanding shiksa in her own right a personal friend of mine and Bobbie's, Mindy McConnell.
LEADMALE:( mumbling ): Please come up Me?! Uh although, uh, Bob and I lived under th-the same roof, we-we never really knew each other that well.
SUPMALE:I mean, I'm even afraid of spiders, right? Anyway, in spite of our differences, I-I feel that I-I got to know Bob better than any other caterpillar I ever met, and, uh she sure was great, Bob was.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Mindala.
SUPMALE:And now, a man who is said to have the warmth of a snow pea Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:Bickley, a few words.
LEADMALE:( mumbling ) ( whipsering ) With heavy heart and mournful eyes and tears that softly flow we say our final, sad good-byes, to a fuzzy escargot.
LEADMALE:( crying ) Hog slop.
LEADFEMALE:When I first met Bob, I had no way of knowing she was on her last legs.
OTHERMALE:But, uh, I realized she was a good pet.
SUPMALE:Not as good as dog, though.
LEADFEMALE:A dog can hop up on your bed and snuggle his cute little face next to you ( weeping ): in the bed and softly whimper when he's hungry and and put his little paw in yours as though to say, "I love you, Daddy.
LEADMALE:" Oh, I can't take it anymore! I'm coming, Bickey! Daddy's coming! Daddy's! And now it's time for the burial.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you want the Evelyn Wood version? I want to bury her out here in your philodendron so she'd always be outdoors.
LEADFEMALE:Oh who are you and what have you done with Bob? That is Bob, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:She's turned into a butterfly.
SUPMALE:Quick, take her to the window.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, I don't understand.
SUPMALE:What's happening? Well, see, Bob wasn't dead.
SUPFEMALE:She was just changing.
LEADFEMALE:Caterpillars turn into butterflies.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I guess I'd better set her free.
LEADMALE:There we go, Bob.
LEADMALE:Fly, Bob! Be free! There you go, Bob! Oh, she was beautiful.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, now I guess you probably believe what Exidor said about reincarnation, right? No, I still think Exidor had his head up his foot.
SUPMALE:Maybe he's right, though.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe when you die, something beautiful happens.
LEADFEMALE:That's a nice thought.
LEADMALE:Hey, let's go follow Bob.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:I could have made it.
SUPMALE:MORK: Mork calling Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERMALE:Yo, Battlestar Gigantica.
SUPFEMALE:Here I am, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:What do you have to report? Well, sir, this week I learned many wonderful things.
LEADFEMALE:First of all, I learned the meaning of the old Earth phrase, "You can't take it with you," because I went to the place where you have to leave it.
LEADFEMALE:It's called a funeral home.
LEADFEMALE:Is that where they put old funerals? Close, you old gobbler.
LEADMALE:You get half a laugh for that one.
OTHERFEMALE:( soft honking bark ) No, actually a funeral is like a track meet.
LEADFEMALE:First of all, you have to wear black, you don't need a stopwatch, and one of the guys is really lousy in a relay race.
LEADFEMALE:You really have a way with words, Mork.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thank you, Your Immenseness.
SUPFEMALE:You should have heard the eulogy I did for my caterpillar.
LEADMALE:Mindy says that when he dies, he'll go to Heaven and be with all the other bugs and he'll be very happy and everything will be beautiful.
SUPMALE:Tell me, if Heaven is so beautiful, so perfect, so great, how come humans don't want to die? Who wants to be with all those bugs? What do you think happens when something dies, Mork? I don't know, sir.
LEADMALE:All I know is when my caterpillar became a butterfly and sprouted wings and flew away, she looked kind of a like a little angel.
LEADMALE:See you next week.
SUPMALE:( to "Hallelujah" melody ): Na-nu na-nu Na-nu na-nu, na-na-na-nu, na-na-na-nu, na-na-na-nu Na-nu na-nu
OTHERFEMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu! ( upbeat theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) ( thunder crashes ) ( thunder crashes ) Here's your coffee, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Bickley.
LEADFEMALE:Ahh.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
LEADMALE:Mm, just like Mom used to make.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom's coffee was awful too.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley, I was wondering if you wanted to go to Utah with Mork and me to visit Dad.
LEADFEMALE:You're not gonna believe this.
SUPMALE:He got a job with a symphony orchestra.
LEADMALE:It's his big debut.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm so proud of him.
OTHERMALE:I never liked your dad much.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE:That's a nice thing to say.
OTHERMALE:Oh, it's not his fault.
SUPMALE:I never liked anybody very much.
SUPFEMALE:But I must say, it's not easy for a man to sell his business and take a new job.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:That's why this job is so perfect for him.
SUPMALE:He's always wanted to be a symphony conductor, and this orchestra is gonna take him around the country.
LEADMALE:Ah, yes.
SUPFEMALE:Zubin McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:Ha! Don't panic.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, not again.
LEADMALE:It's nothing serious.
SUPMALE:Just the world as we know it is coming to an end.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, it's about time.
OTHERMALE:The, uh, world is coming The world as we know it.
LEADMALE:The world as we know it is coming to an end.
SUPMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:You see, I went downtown to buy a book, the Life and Hard Times of Princess Rainier of Monaco, and there, plastered on every newspaper, was "energy crisis.
SUPFEMALE:" Don't panic.
SUPFEMALE:Don't panic.
SUPFEMALE:Remain calm.
LEADMALE:Energy crisis.
SUPFEMALE:Big deal.
LEADMALE:Big deal? It is a big deal, Mr.
SUPMALE:Smarty-Pants Republican.
LEADMALE:Unless we find an alternative source of energy for oil, we have to conserve, and I was making darn sure we conserve.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, what were you doing? I shot out the streetlights in downtown Boulder.
SUPMALE:I took out all the traffic lights too.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna kinda miss them though.
LEADFEMALE:Red, yellow, green.
LEADFEMALE:Such festive colors.
SUPFEMALE:They were so pretty.
LEADFEMALE:People used to stop their cars and watch them change.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, relax, okay? Relax? Relax? How can I relax? Mindy, there's a world beyond I Love Lucy.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you understand? We're running out of fossil fuels.
LEADFEMALE:There aren't any more dinosaurs dying, and Dinah Shore is still in residuals.
LEADFEMALE:It's a whole different world.
LEADMALE:And pretty soon, they'll be drilling in the cemeteries looking for oil.
LEADFEMALE:I can see the advertising slogans now: "Put our relative in your tank.
LEADMALE:" And they'll have testimonials: "Hi, I got 20 miles to the gallon using my Aunt Tess.
SUPFEMALE:" Mork, there is an energy crisis, and in 50 or 60 years, we probably won't have any more oil.
LEADFEMALE:But a lot of people believe that the oil companies are just using scare tactics so they can hike the prices.
OTHERFEMALE:Somebody is getting very rich at our expense.
LEADFEMALE:Why would someone wanna get rich at someone else's expense? ( chuckles ) Let me put it to you this way.
SUPFEMALE:Some of us believe the people who own the oil are shaking down the rest of the world.
OTHERMALE:Oh, so that's why they call it shakes, for the booty.
LEADMALE:As long as the oil companies keep backing the politicians Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! What's so funny about that? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha! Well, you just laughed.
LEADFEMALE:No, I didn't.
SUPMALE:Ha-ha-ha-ha! There you go again.
OTHERMALE:That was a sneeze.
LEADFEMALE:Are you making fun of me? If that's your sneeze, take my advice.
LEADMALE:Never go to a funeral in the rain.
LEADMALE:Look at you, Mork.
LEADMALE:You're soaking wet.
SUPMALE:Why don't you take off your clothes? Mork Oh, good idea.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha-ha! Gesundheit.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, you're really catching a cold.
SUPMALE:Come here.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna give you something.
LEADMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:Take one of these.
LEADMALE:What is it? It's a cold capsule.
LEADFEMALE:It'll help shrink your nasal membranes and clear your head.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Ow.
SUPFEMALE:Mork! You don't put it in your ear.
LEADFEMALE:Try swallowing it.
SUPFEMALE:Swallow it? That's the wrong way.
OTHERFEMALE:I've got a head cold.
SUPFEMALE:Trust me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, okay, but I'm warning you, if I swallow this, there's a darn good chance you'll never see it again.
LEADFEMALE:Ar, ar! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha! That boy is a little short from the neck up.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't even know how to take a cold tablet.
LEADMALE:Well, he hasn't been sick much.
LEADMALE:You don't have to have a high fever to know where to stick the thermometer.
LEADMALE:So, what about Dad's concert? Are you gonna make the trip with Mork and me? Who do I have to share the back seat with, Mork or your grandmother? Oh, you don't know.
SUPMALE:Grandma's already there.
SUPFEMALE:She's gonna make the entire tour with Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Wow! Every conductor's dream, a 78-year-old groupie.
LEADMALE:Ha! MINDY: We'll have to work on his attitude.
LEADMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) Eeeee! ( glass breaks ) What are you doing?! I just eliminated a negative.
LEADFEMALE:There's one streetlight that's sucked his last watt.
SUPMALE:Stop it, Mork! That is wrong! Mindy, don't you think I know right from wrong? Well, yes, but you just can't run around doing right all the time.
LEADFEMALE:It's It's just not right.
SUPFEMALE:Shazbat.
LEADMALE:Mayday.
SUPFEMALE:Amrak.
LEADMALE:Faze and confusion.
LEADFEMALE:Just when I think I have Earth communication down, right is wrong.
LEADMALE:All right, readjust.
LEADMALE:Famous architect, Frank Lloyd Wrong.
SUPMALE:Famous soul group, the Wrongous Brothers.
SUPMALE:Bo Didn't-Do-Diddley.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you've gotta understand.
LEADFEMALE:You just can't go around taking the law into your own hands.
LEADFEMALE:Otherwise, you're nothing more than a vigilante.
SUPFEMALE:Do you know what a vigilante is? Sure I know what a vigilante is.
SUPMALE:It's a guy who's looking for a girl who's a vigilan.
LEADFEMALE:They're an endangered species.
LEADMALE:Mindy, I know what I did was wrong, but I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well.
SUPMALE:It's okay, Mork, just as long as you don't go around breaking any more streetlights.
SUPFEMALE:Promise? Promise.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:What did you do to your nightshirt? Mindy, I feel guilty, but I think that's rather a personal question.
SUPMALE:I mean, when did you buy the new one? Look, it's at least two sizes too big for you.
SUPMALE:See how the sleeves come over your hands like this? Wait a minute, here.
LEADFEMALE:You look like a Ku Klux candy cane.
LEADMALE:Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, this is the same cap and the same nightshirt I've always had.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it can't be, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Look how big it is for you.
LEADMALE:Mindy, how tall am I? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Usually you're about About like that.
LEADMALE:But you used to be up there.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:You know that pill you gave me to shrink my nasal membranes? I forgot.
LEADMALE:We Orkans are all membrane.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, that's impossible.
LEADFEMALE:A person doesn't just shrink.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Then how come my shorts just fell off? ( upbeat theme playing ) Oh, Mork, this book covers every disease known to man.
LEADFEMALE:There's not a word in here about shrinking.
SUPFEMALE:I can always play shortstop.
SUPFEMALE:Ar, ar, ar! How can you make jokes? In less than one day, you have shrunk down to half your size.
OTHERMALE:This tiny-time capsule can't go on forever.
SUPMALE:In the meantime, in the words of Esther Williams, I've gotta go with the flow.
SUPMALE:Don't be sad.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks for the new clothes anyway.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, my old clothes are getting to be a hassle.
OTHERMALE:Last night in my sleep I rolled over and my nightshirt didn't.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I borrowed those from Billy's mom from across the street.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry I didn't get you any shoes that fit.
OTHERMALE:Ah, my old shoes are fine.
LEADMALE:I kinda consider them my own personal tribute to Emmett Kelly.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, when are you gonna face reality? You are shrinking.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but you gotta look on the bright side, Mindy.
LEADMALE:There's gotta be a pony in here somewhere.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I could be Paul Williams' valet.
LEADFEMALE:Some people say, "If I knew then, what I know now.
SUPFEMALE:" Well, I've got my eye on this cute little 8-year-old.
LEADFEMALE:She's got the body of a 6-year old though, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, stop it! Mindy, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:There's no use both of us being scared to death.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:The least you can let me do is call a doctor.
LEADFEMALE:A normal doctor isn't good for me, Mind.
LEADMALE:I have a different metabolism.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I have to call a shrink.
LEADMALE:Oh, I know.
SUPMALE:A little Orkan humor, right? Ar, ar.
LEADFEMALE:A little Orkan humor, Mindy? Is that a short joke? Real funny, Mindy.
LEADMALE:So I called in a shrink.
SUPMALE:Big deal! He'll get here soon.
SUPMALE:He'll be here soon.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
OTHERMALE:A shrink is a slang word for a psychiatrist.
LEADFEMALE:Not mine.
OTHERFEMALE:No, not my shrink.
SUPFEMALE:( knocking on door ) Besides, he told me I don't care what he told you.
SUPMALE:A shrink has nothing to do with anything that's shrunk.
SUPMALE:( gasps ) Who says we don't make house calls anymore? Mork, it's for you.
LEADMALE:Where is the little fella? Straight ahead and down.
LEADMALE:Will you boys please get out? Let the shrimp boat sink in dignity.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're all heart.
SUPMALE:A good shrink has to be.
LEADFEMALE:I said get out! Boogie-oogie-oogie! Will you get that ugly thing away from me? There's no telling where it's been.
SUPMALE:Mindy, you remember Dr.
SUPMALE:Exidor.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, don't call me "doctor," Mork.
LEADMALE:I refuse to be put in a category with those quacks.
LEADFEMALE:Boogie-oogie-oogie! However, if you insist on a label, call me Ms.
LEADMALE:That's good.
LEADMALE:It goes with the outfit.
LEADMALE:Speaking of outfits, I love yours, Mork.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Except the duck feet have got to go.
LEADMALE:Can I have them when you Don't talk like that.
LEADFEMALE:He's not gonna shrink any more.
SUPMALE:Why, of course not.
LEADFEMALE:But if I were you, I'd take some snapshots just to be safe.
SUPMALE:How are you feeling, Mork? Oh, not bad.
LEADFEMALE:A little short of breath.
SUPFEMALE:Ar, ar, ar.
LEADMALE:Now, this has gone too far.
LEADMALE:What you need is a real doctor.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you mean like a real doctor that golfs on Wednesday, fee-splits on Thursday, puts you on hold on Friday? Mork, most doctors are highly qualified.
SUPMALE:Oh, sure, in their own backward ways.
SUPMALE:But I'm strides ahead of them.
LEADMALE:And I don't mean little froggy steps.
SUPMALE:I mean giant strides ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Giant strides ahead of every doctor in the world.
LEADMALE:You mean you're bigger than Dr.
OTHERMALE:Joyce Brothers? I even have prettier hair.
LEADMALE:Are you bigger than Doc Severinsen? Dr.
SUPMALE:Scholl's? Dr Pepper? Oh, please! We're not talking fruity-flavored drinks, Mork.
SUPMALE:We're talking hard, scientific facts based on years of research, dedication, experimentation.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't step there! Step on a crack, break your mother's back.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, this guy is no better than a witch doctor.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's That's Ms.
LEADMALE:Witch Doctor, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Mork.
LEADMALE:Now then, let's discuss those symptoms.
SUPFEMALE:Just lie back.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:A pencil for shorthand.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:Tell me do you get mad when you hear the song "Short People"? No.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like to be Ricardo Montalban's sidekick? Not my fantasy.
LEADMALE:Do you look up to Paul Williams? No, but I can take him a little bit at a time.
LEADMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:You're cured.
SUPFEMALE:What?! You are out of your skull.
SUPMALE:Did you hear that, Pedro? La seÃ±ora no en casa.
SUPMALE:I'm no en casa? You're no en casa! He is getting small.
LEADMALE:My dear lady! There never has been anything wrong with him.
LEADFEMALE:( sighs ) The rest of us are getting bigger.
SUPMALE:What? Just last night, Walter Cronkite said the entire world is suffering inflation.
SUPFEMALE:Out! Goodbye, you normal kind of guy.
LEADMALE:You're one lucky cat.
SUPMALE:Ciao, ciao, ciao.
LEADMALE:Hey, you kids! Quit poking that burro! Sorry, Pedro, you've got to go on ahead! I'll be there shortly! Oop! ( sighs ) Well, Mork, you just gotta think positive.
LEADMALE:The effects of that pill will have to wear off soon and Uh and then you'll be back to your normal size.
SUPFEMALE:You've already stopped shrinking.
LEADMALE:I think.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for the encouragement, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:But a few hours ago, this shirt used to be form-fitting, and either I've discovered a revolutionary new diet, or I'm still shrinking.
OTHERMALE:What am I gonna do, Mind? I don't know.
SUPMALE:( dramatic theme playing ) ( suspenseful theme playing ) MINDY: How does the suit fit? Oh, nice, considering.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I'm really sorry the store was out of Ken dolls.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, me too.
LEADFEMALE:I feel kind of funny wearing Tacky Bob clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, better late than never.
LEADMALE:Ar.
LEADMALE:There are certain advantages to being small, though.
SUPFEMALE:At least you can get an entire living room set for $6 and some change.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Mork, I know it looks like you've stopped shrinking, but I really wish you'd let me take you to a doctor.
LEADMALE:Don't you think a doctor would be suspicious that I'm an alien? I'm smaller than things that most people have removed.
LEADMALE:Okay, no doctors.
SUPFEMALE:But how do you know you're gonna return to your normal size? Well, I haven't shrank in over an hour.
LEADMALE:Hey, in no time at all, I'll just be growing real big again.
SUPMALE:No time "a tall.
LEADMALE:" Ar, ar, ar.
LEADFEMALE:Ar, ar, ar.
OTHERMALE:Mind, don't you have to be going to school today? Yeah, I really should.
LEADFEMALE:I have a journalism exam.
LEADMALE:But I don't wanna leave you.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Mindy, I'm a big boy now.
OTHERFEMALE:Get out of here before I spank your ankles.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Are you sure? Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, get outta here.
SUPMALE:Take a hike.
SUPFEMALE:Well, is there anything I can get you while I'm out? Well, you can pick me up a Barbie doll, the one with all the accessories.
LEADMALE:Oh, by the way, the exterminator man is supposed to come today Heh, heh.
LEADMALE:I guess better cancel that, huh? Sorry.
LEADMALE:See you later.
LEADFEMALE:( dramatic theme playing ) Oh, no! Another time capsule just went o-o-off! This means I'm still shrinking.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm glad I got rid of Mindy so she didn't have to see this.
LEADFEMALE:Pretty soon I'm gonna be a speck of dead meat.
LEADFEMALE:Woe is me.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork ( mysterious theme playing ) Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, sir.
LEADFEMALE:ORSON: "Sir"? You called me "sir"? You usually start your report with one of your snide little fat jokes.
SUPMALE:I'm in big trouble, Orson.
LEADMALE:Not exactly big.
OTHERMALE:It's kind of the opposite.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about? I took some Earth medication that's making me shrink.
LEADMALE:If I don't stop, I'm gonna dwindle away to nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Waa-ah-aah! See? The outside of me shrank again.
LEADFEMALE:It's getting worse.
LEADFEMALE:You've got to do something, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't there anything on Earth that will make things grow? All right, let's see I could stand in fertilizer, but the smell would kill me.
LEADMALE:There must be something else.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Mork, think.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for the pressure.
LEADMALE:Let's see Uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:Well, Mindy's into health food.
LEADFEMALE:She takes brewer's yeast.
LEADMALE:Does yeast make Mindy grow? No.
LEADFEMALE:But yeast makes bread grow, and this might work for me.
SUPFEMALE:It's a million-to-one shot, but it's the only shot I've got.
SUPMALE:See, if I don't stop it, I'm gonna see how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.
LEADFEMALE:Well, good luck, Mork.
SUPMALE:Thank you, mon gÃ©nÃ©ral.
LEADFEMALE:This is Mork, signing off, maybe for the last time.
OTHERFEMALE:Nanu.
SUPFEMALE:( groans ) ( mysterious theme playing ) Oh, I feel like the Incredible Hulk in reverse.
LEADMALE:What am I gonna do? I don't ( dramatic theme playing ) On one hand, voilÃ ! On the other hand, heavy sigh.
OTHERMALE:There's the yeast, but it might as well be on the other side of the Rockies.
SUPFEMALE:What? Wha-ah! ( groaning ) Mondo vertigo.
SUPMALE:It's Hitchcock city.
SUPFEMALE:I want to get down.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to end up as an alien pizza.
SUPFEMALE:( suspenseful theme playing ) Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:( sighs ) ( sniffing ) Oh, time to use the old noodle.
SUPFEMALE:( chuckles ) ( suspenseful theme playing ) ( sniffing ) Phew! I gotta tell Mindy she uses too much garlic.
LEADFEMALE:I feel like Tarzan-elli hanging up here.
LEADFEMALE:She has the only pasta in the world that has a half-life.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I should be thankful though she made spaghetti.
LEADFEMALE:Sure would be a drag to have to shimmy down succotash.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh.
LEADMALE:( knocking on door ) BICKLEY: Mindy! Mork! Oh, Bick, not now.
LEADMALE:I haven't got time for small talk.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? Mork? Mindy? ( dog barking ) Bicky, you stay down there.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy will be right back.
LEADMALE:( dog barking ) BICKLEY: Mork? I came over to borrow your book, you know, Cheryl Tiegs, the Early Years.
LEADMALE:Mork? It's too deep.
LEADMALE:You'll never understand it.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy? Are you in the bedroom? Oh, well, I guess they won't mind if I just borrow it.
SUPFEMALE:I think I saw it over there.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no! Come on, Cheryl.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be shy.
LEADFEMALE:The whole world has seen that bathing suit by now.
LEADMALE:Oh! Uh-oh! It's happening again.
OTHERFEMALE:( dog barks ) Oh, hi, Bicky.
OTHERMALE:I told you to wait downstairs.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll find that book in a minute, and we'll go for a nice walk.
OTHERFEMALE:( dog whimpers ) BICKLEY: How much Is that doggy in the window? ( dramatic theme playing ) Oh, no! Aah! ( dramatic theme playing ) Tiny feets, don't fail me now! Oh Ah.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-oh, I found it.
LEADMALE:Come on, Bicky, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:( whimpers ) ( sighs ) ( dog barking ) Come on.
OTHERMALE:Oh, hi.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing here? Oh, I just came over to borrow Mork's book.
LEADMALE:He said I could.
LEADMALE:You saw Mork? A couple of days ago.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:The door was unlocked.
LEADMALE:I hope you don't mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no.
SUPMALE:Not at all.
OTHERMALE:I'll tell Mork that you borrowed his book.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:See ya.
LEADMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:Mork, where are you? Mork? Ugh.
OTHERMALE:Mork? Mind, is that you? MINDY: Mork? ( screeching ) Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I love Steamboat Willie.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! Mindy! Mindy! Mindy! Mindy! Mind! Min! Oh, Min! Mindy! Mork, is that you? Where are you? Mork? Mork?! MORK: Mindy! Down here! Careful where you step! Oh, Mork! Mork, you're still shrinking.
SUPMALE:Mindy, I don't have much time left.
SUPMALE:You've got to help me.
OTHERMALE:There's only one chance.
LEADMALE:What is it? I've got to get some of your brewer's yeast.
LEADMALE:It's a chance in a million, but it might make me rise.
LEADFEMALE:Hurry, please! Okay.
SUPFEMALE:I've got you.
LEADFEMALE:You do great work, Mind.
LEADMALE:Just don't applaud yourself.
SUPMALE:This is no time for jokes.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for the lift, Mind.
LEADMALE:I knew I was in good hands.
LEADMALE:Ar! Why is this happening? I thought you'd stopped shrinking I don't know, Mind.
LEADMALE:I guess it's another example of lousy living through chemistry.
LEADFEMALE:Ar.
LEADMALE:The smaller I get, the faster I shrink.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's gonna be all right.
LEADMALE:Here's the yeast.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:I think we've uncovered a little flaw in my plan.
LEADMALE:I know! I'll crush it up and dissolve it in water.
SUPMALE:( water rushing ) It's happening again! Hurry, Mindy! I am.
OTHERMALE:Hang on.
SUPMALE:Hurry, Mind! I'm rapidly becoming hindsi-i-i-ght! ( gasps ) I'm coming, Mork! ( gasps ) Mork! Mindy! Mindy! ( high-pitched echoing ): Mindy! Oh, my God, he's gone! ( dramatic theme playing ) ( echoing ): Mindy! Mindy! Mindy! Mindy! ( yelling ) ( suspenseful theme playing ) MORK ( echoing ): Mindy! Mindy! Mindy! Mindy! Mindy! Mindy! Mindy! Mindy! ( yelling ) ( moos ) ( cow moos ) ( moos ) Hello, Bossy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you have something I need bad.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:A little roomy.
LEADMALE:I hope no one tries to milk me.
SUPFEMALE:Ar, ar.
LEADMALE:Boy, I must have shrank into a whole new universe.
LEADFEMALE:You know, this planet's probably just a molecule on Mindy's tablecloth.
LEADMALE:Either that or I somehow or other landed in the Ayatollah Khomeini's farm.
LEADMALE:Ar, ar! Well, at least if you're wearing pants, it's gotta be an intelligent society, or at least fashionable.
OTHERMALE:Well, I just hope they're friendly.
SUPMALE:Here I am, a coward in a brave new world.
SUPFEMALE:What would Bert Lahr do in a situation like this? ( mock growl ) I know.
OTHERFEMALE:Haul Oz out of here.
SUPMALE:Well, moo gesundheit.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Hm.
LEADFEMALE:( suspenseful theme playing ) Wah! Got him! God bless you and keep you, and we got you.
SUPFEMALE:( laughing ) You certainly are well-dressed for being so hostile.
OTHERMALE:One, two, three, fore! Come on, spy, sing along.
OTHERMALE:Oh, it's a silly quirk but I hardly ever sing along with people who tie me up.
LEADMALE:What do you say, fellas? Should we take five? I might tell you good idea.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, question.
LEADFEMALE:Why is there furniture in the middle of a field? Good grief, our house has been stolen.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:There's something about you guys, like I've met you before.
SUPMALE:On a telethon perhaps? But this I must say.
SUPMALE:Hi, I'm Bob "There's big bucks in comedy" Faith.
LEADFEMALE:I think we're being a little rude to our prisoner here.
SUPMALE:We're sort of violating the rules of the Geneva "Have a nice day" Convention.
LEADFEMALE:I think we should be introducing ourselves.
OTHERFEMALE:JERRY: Hello! I'm Jerry Looney! ( laughing ) BOB: Try to get over that, Jerry.
LEADMALE:Hi, I'm Danny St.
LEADMALE:Tommy, and here's a picture of my family.
SUPMALE:There's my daughter, St.
LEADMALE:Marlo, my son, St.
SUPFEMALE:Rusty, and here's my dog, St.
SUPFEMALE:Spot.
SUPMALE:I I don't mean to pry, but why am I all tied up? All right, already.
LEADMALE:Don't you know there's a rebellion going on? We're an outrageous, zany bunch of revolutionaries ( laughing ) called the Sillies.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha.
OTHERFEMALE:And we're revolting BOB & JERRY: We are? against the Glums.
LEADFEMALE:And I just want to say we think you're a spy.
SUPMALE:A spy? But for who? The evil king and his Glums.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds like a punk-rock group.
LEADFEMALE:Seriously, folks, I think we should hit the road to camp.
LEADFEMALE:( circus music playing ) ( crowd chattering ) MAN: Ready, aim, fire! The arrow's funny, kid, but get yourself a tux, huh? Well, excu-u-u-u-se me! Whoa, so this is comedy purgatory.
OTHERMALE:This isn't a guerrilla camp.
LEADMALE:This is high camp.
LEADMALE:Look at all this great humor going to waste and because the king won't let people laugh.
LEADFEMALE:I hate to be kind of a living clichÃ©, but when are you gonna take me to your leader? Well, that all depends on whether our leader is in camp or still working undercover in the king's castle.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:BOB: Leader, leader? Are you in? This is Bob "We think we caught a spy who fell from the sky" Faith.
LEADMALE:WOMAN: Have him washed and sent to my tent.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERFEMALE:Ahh! You know something? Even by my standards, you guys are very bizarre.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, wait.
OTHERMALE:I feel like a real drip.
OTHERFEMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:WOMAN: I'll be out in a minute.
SUPFEMALE:I'm slipping into something more comfortable.
LEADFEMALE:I'll slip out of something uncomfortable.
LEADFEMALE:So you're a spy.
OTHERMALE:Mindy! Mindy, Mindy, Mindy! Mindy, Mind That's Mandy, Mandy, Mandy, pal.
LEADMALE:Mandy? Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Einstein was right.
LEADFEMALE:I've fallen into a parallel universe.
LEADMALE:This is incredible.
LEADMALE:This is the ultimate dÃ©jÃ  vu.
OTHERMALE:It's dÃ©jÃ -jÃ  vu-vu.
LEADMALE:What? I come from another planet.
OTHERMALE:Actually, two other planets.
SUPFEMALE:But don't worry about that.
SUPMALE:I came from a place where there's a clone of you named Mindy.
SUPMALE:She's a girl I live with.
LEADFEMALE:And even the furniture is the same.
OTHERFEMALE:Everything is similar.
SUPFEMALE:It's parallel! Look, pal, if you're trying to break in a new act, I'm really too busy.
SUPMALE:I happen to have a revolution to run.
SUPFEMALE:And, uh, where'd you get the silly pants? It looks like something a cow should be wearing.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you go back there and change? Anything would be better than that.
SUPFEMALE:Right, Mand Mind Uh Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:I can prove to you that I come from a parallel universe.
SUPFEMALE:Oh? Is there a wicker chest in front of you? Yes.
OTHERMALE:On Earth, the Mindy I know keeps her high school graduation picture hidden there, back when she was el-chubbo and used to give fish kisses.
LEADMALE:Oh! How did you know that? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I also know that inside there is a flimsy-type nightgown that is so sheer she hasn't got the nerve to wear it.
SUPMALE:Well, I'll wear that someday.
SUPMALE:Before I give you my final proof, one question: Is there anybody on this planet who drinks with their finger? No.
LEADFEMALE:How would you like your lake drained? ( upbeat theme playing ) MORK: Now it's your turn.
LEADMALE:Tell me about this revolution you're planning.
SUPMALE:Well, the name of this planet is Mirth.
SUPMALE:And it used to be a pretty happy place to live until five years ago when this king took over.
LEADFEMALE:He's the head of the Glum Party.
LEADFEMALE:And if you can believe this, he actually outlawed humor.
OTHERFEMALE:So I formed a band of Sillies to overthrow the Glums.
LEADFEMALE:That's one part that doesn't fit though.
LEADMALE:You're not silly at all.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) I'm not silly but I like to laugh.
LEADFEMALE:I appreciate humor.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's our God-given right to be happy, and that alone is worth fighting for.
LEADFEMALE:The king just wants everybody to be miserable.
LEADFEMALE:This king sounds like a real nimnol.
OTHERMALE:Oh, he's worse than that.
SUPFEMALE:He's a crook too.
LEADFEMALE:He actually cut off our energy supply just so he could raise the rates and make everybody else more glum.
LEADMALE:So now we only have electricity every other day.
LEADFEMALE:I'm odd.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Mork, you could help our cause.
SUPMALE:MORK: Me? Morko the schlug? No, you don't need that kind of help.
SUPMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:All my men are known, but you aren't.
SUPMALE:If you could get a job at the castle, well, then, you could be our spy.
SUPFEMALE:All we have to do is prove that the king is a crook, and I know even his glums would turn against him.
LEADMALE:And then my people can laugh again.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:But you don't just knock on a castle door and say, "Hello, Kelly boy.
SUPFEMALE:" besides, I don't do moats.
LEADFEMALE:Ar, Ar.
OTHERMALE:No, there's no problem.
LEADFEMALE:I work in the castle.
LEADMALE:I can make sure you get a job.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but if you work there, why do you need me? I'm the head of public information.
SUPMALE:They don't tell me anything.
SUPFEMALE:( sighs ) Oh, Mork, please.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm kind of new at this joke-and-dagger stuff, but All right.
LEADMALE:I'll do it for you.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:( romantic theme playing ) ( sighs ) Oh.
LEADMALE:This 007 stuff sure is kayo.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but what kind of a job can you get me in a castle? ( dramatic theme playing ) ( clears throat ) Announcing the new court serious.
LEADMALE:( fanfare plays ) Depressing morning, ladies and gentlemen.
OTHERMALE:( strums instrument ) Whoa! In today's news, first, the Foul Jones Industrial Averages: War and pestilence up in heavy trading.
SUPFEMALE:( strums ) Whoa! But I want to grieve to you.
LEADFEMALE:The Royal Medical Society said today that everything causes respiratory disease.
SUPMALE:Flus at eleven.
SUPMALE:( strums ) Whoa! That's good stuff.
LEADMALE:It'll really depress the king.
LEADFEMALE:He'll love it.
LEADFEMALE:Bick! Bick Maintain.
SUPFEMALE:Maintain.
SUPMALE:Catchy walk too.
LEADMALE:Mork, this is Marvin, the king's financial advisor and bootblack.
OTHERMALE:Mandy, I want this released to the press as soon as possible.
LEADMALE:Certainly.
LEADFEMALE:Go! Yes, sir.
SUPMALE:Now remember, when you meet the king, it's negative, negative, negative.
OTHERFEMALE:And whatever you do, don't smile.
OTHERFEMALE:He won't even know I have teeth.
SUPMALE:( strums ) Whoa! Good boy.
LEADFEMALE:Good boy.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:( ringing ) Announcing his majesty, king of the Glums, emperor of Mirth, and conqueror of the renegade chipmunks.
LEADFEMALE:Sanctuary! Sanctuary! All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Friend of everything brown, and absolute owner of all electricity.
OTHERMALE:( dramatic theme playing ) Exidor! Exidor? My name isn't Exidor.
LEADMALE:My name is Exidon! Oh, sorry, king's X.
SUPFEMALE:But, excuse me, but you have little eyes painted on your eyelids.
LEADFEMALE:Are you paranoid? No.
SUPMALE:Why do you ask? I do this so that assassins don't know when I'm asleep.
LEADMALE:MORK: Oh.
SUPFEMALE:In school, they must have called you four eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! You should have heard what they called me when I wore glasses.
LEADMALE:Children can be so cruel.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I love them.
LEADMALE:Why am I talking to a man who has just pinched the head off his little doll? Your highness, this is your new court serious.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, he has some fairly good material.
LEADFEMALE:War, pestilence, disease.
SUPMALE:Pretty heady stuff.
OTHERMALE:I promise I'll depress you.
LEADMALE:I'll bring you down.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bum you out.
LEADMALE:I'll make you feel like trash.
LEADMALE:Oh, please.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, please You'll have to depress me later.
LEADMALE:Business before pleasure.
LEADFEMALE:You guards, out, before I have your heads cut off too! Whoa! Who-oh-oah! Marvin, I wanna talk to you.
LEADMALE:I wanna talk to you about the phony energy crisis.
LEADFEMALE:Now, we're going to have to shut off even more power if we're going to make the people really miserable and glum.
SUPFEMALE:( clears throat ) And if we happen to make a couple of bucks along the way, what's it hurt? Ixnay.
LEADMALE:Ixnay.
LEADMALE:If you can't trust your own court serious, who can you trust? Whoa! Boy, are you paranoid.
SUPFEMALE:I've written my entire plan on this tape and signed it.
SUPFEMALE:You wrote your plan on adhesive tape? It's perfectly safe.
LEADFEMALE:No one's allowed in my medicine cabinet.
OTHERFEMALE:The entire plan is there, except for the first I had to tape up a leak.
LEADMALE:Whoa! MORK: Psst, Mandy! ( whispers ): Mork, is that you? ( gasps ) No, this is me.
OTHERMALE:That's a suit of armor, and this is my agent, Saul.
SUPFEMALE:Shh! No jokes.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Shh! Shh! ( whispering ): Exidon admitted everything.
LEADFEMALE:He is deliberately limiting the electricity.
LEADMALE:His slogan is: "Power to the people on a rolling brownout basis.
OTHERMALE:" Oh, if we could prove that, we could dethrone the king.
SUPFEMALE:And then all the people could laugh again.
LEADFEMALE:But it's just your word against his.
SUPFEMALE:What we need is proof.
LEADMALE:Proof? I'll get you proof and I'll make it stick.
LEADFEMALE:Be careful.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want anything to happen to you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:( bells jingle ) Shh.
SUPFEMALE:Mandy, you're soft, just like Mindy.
LEADMALE:Don't you worry about old Morko.
SUPMALE:I'll take care of everything.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe when all this dirty business is over we can get together and tickle each other's funny bone.
LEADFEMALE:Ar, ar! Shh! Shh! ( upbeat theme playing ) ( peaceful theme playing ) Mork, you've done it.
LEADMALE:You've really done it! Yeah, I figure we have him by the short wires now.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, you've saved my people from a terrible tyrant.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
SUPFEMALE:( barking ) Did you hear something? No, just fireworks.
SUPFEMALE:Bombs bursting in the air, rockets' red glare.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, Mork.
LEADMALE:It's probably nothing, but it wouldn't hurt to check.
SUPMALE:I'll be right back, okay? But, but, but Yes, all right.
SUPMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADMALE:( dogs barking ) We must be getting close.
LEADFEMALE:Just look at Fifi and Raoul.
LEADMALE:I'm just happy they're on our side.
LEADMALE:Let's go! Get her, boys! Don't let her go! So you fell for my little trap, eh? I suspected you right from the start.
LEADFEMALE:I knew that court serious was a spy.
LEADFEMALE:Run, Mork, run! Take the evidence to the people! Run! I'll be back for you, Mandy! You'd better be back by noon tomorrow, unless you're into taxidermy! ( action theme playing ) ( Mork panting ) Mandy BOB: He can't talk.
LEADMALE:He's out of breath.
OTHERFEMALE:JERRY: Well, show us.
LEADMALE:( whistles ) Mandy.
LEADFEMALE:( whistles ) Exidon.
SUPFEMALE:( whistling, barking ) You mean they're with those two killer dogs, Raoul and Fifi? ( whistles ) JERRY: All right, already.
LEADFEMALE:I'll handle this.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha-ha! Calm down, Mork, because we want you to take a picture of the three of us in front of our marquee.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Remember, I'm in the middle.
LEADFEMALE:Make room for Danny.
LEADFEMALE:( whistling ) BOB: Exidon and Mandy.
SUPFEMALE:What about 'em? They've captured her? Oh, yeah? Exidon, yeah? Is a crook.
LEADFEMALE:( whistling ) Yeah? And Mandy? Yeah? Tastes like Mm? Savor it? Save her?! Why, the castle's an armed camp.
OTHERFEMALE:Armed camp? Great audience.
LEADMALE:( whistling ) BOB: Huh? No good? Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:( whistling ) BOB: Something at noon.
SUPFEMALE:The shiksa dies at noon.
SUPMALE:Oh! Now, God knows I'd do anything to help her, but God also knows there are thousands of troops surrounding the castle, and there are not enough of us to fight them.
LEADMALE:BOB: Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:You got an idea? ( dramatic theme playing ) JERRY: What a great idea, to build a balloon.
LEADFEMALE:It took us all night but we did it.
LEADFEMALE:I've seen cross-stitching before, but you guys are really men of the cloth.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm a very good seamstress.
LEADMALE:We should've taken Dean with us.
LEADMALE:DANNY: Holy Toledo, we're passing over the troops.
LEADMALE:Troops? Hi, guys, I just wanna say it's a pleasure to be here on the front lines with you.
LEADFEMALE:Bob, talk up into the balloon.
OTHERMALE:We need all the lift we can get.
SUPFEMALE:JERRY: Uh-oh.
LEADFEMALE:I hope this thing doesn't spring a leak.
LEADMALE:I haven't memorized all the exits yet.
SUPFEMALE:DANNY: You know, I think the altitude is getting to me.
LEADFEMALE:From up here the planet looks almost round.
OTHERFEMALE:But I just want to say there's the castle.
LEADFEMALE:( dramatic theme playing ) Set down there, Jerry.
SUPFEMALE:Aim for the courtyard.
LEADMALE:JERRY: Look out! We're gonna hit the wall! MORK: Oh.
LEADFEMALE:JERRY: We hit the wall.
LEADMALE:Jerry, quick, throw out the rope.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, take it back up.
SUPMALE:It's Marvin the Evil.
LEADMALE:No, not anymore.
LEADFEMALE:It's Marvin the Swell now.
SUPFEMALE:I've turned over a new leaf.
SUPFEMALE:Graft and corruption is one thing, but executions aren't my cup of hemlock.
LEADFEMALE:I'll drink to that.
LEADMALE:First we have to save Mandy.
SUPMALE:I'll show you where the dungeon is.
LEADMALE:But you have to promise me first, you'll take me up, up and away in your beautiful balloon.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take you anywhere, the 5th dimension, but now we've got a job to do.
SUPFEMALE:Boys, grab your weapons.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:( suspenseful theme playing ) Aahh! OTHERS: Shh! Shh! ( man laughing ) Stop that laughing.
LEADMALE:( laughing ) Stop it or this dungeon will have clown confetti all over it.
SUPMALE:( laughing ) ( whistles ) JERRY & DANNY: Pie, guys! Ugh! Ugh! Argh! ( laughing ) Oh, Mork! Oh, Mandy, I'm sorry about the cream all over the dungeon, but I freed the king's tapes to the people.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, you risked your life for my people.
SUPMALE:No, I did it for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Hey, hey, this is no time to fool around! We've got a balloon to catch.
LEADMALE:Besides, we're running out of ammunition.
SUPMALE:Save a pie for yourselves.
SUPFEMALE:They'll never take us alive! DANNY: Hurry, the revolution has started.
SUPFEMALE:The townspeople are attacking the castle.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa! ( crowd shouting ) ( explosions ) EXIDON: Welcome to my world.
LEADMALE:Prepare for your doom.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess it's time we got our just deserts.
SUPMALE:( chuckles ) Now that's funny.
LEADMALE:( bomb whistling ) Now that's not funny! Whoever did that, off with his head! ( bomb whistling ) EXIDON: Okay! Okay! Off with his trigger finger, but that's the bottom line.
LEADFEMALE:It's all over for you, Exidon.
OTHERMALE:The people are revolting.
LEADMALE:ALL: They are? They've read the tapes.
LEADMALE:Tapes? What tapes? He's a crook, and we have the proof.
SUPMALE:His entire plan is on tape.
OTHERMALE:It's binding evidence too.
LEADMALE:Your noble king caused the power shortage.
SUPMALE:Now try and sell your autobiography.
SUPMALE:Nyah! Off with everybody's head! You caused the power shortage? Off with everybody's head, except yours.
SUPFEMALE:( bomb whistling ) Ahh! I think it's about time for me to goose step out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Don't let him get away! Hit him with a stick! JERRY: Shtick? ( all chattering ) Oh, this is exciting.
LEADFEMALE:Shades of the Magna Carta, Fourth of July, Bastille Day, Cinco de Mayo.
LEADFEMALE:Allons-y de la Patrie Come on, Mandy.
LEADMALE:Let's go, girl.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Mand, let's go! Come on, Mand.
OTHERFEMALE:Up, up, up.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for helping us.
LEADMALE:Mandy, what's wrong? Oh, a shell.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get I'll get you a doctor.
LEADMALE:Mork, I got I got what I wanted.
SUPFEMALE:My people are free.
LEADFEMALE:Now they can laugh again.
LEADMALE:You know, Mork, I think that if I'd ever really gotten to know you, I I could have ( gasps ) Tell Mindy that she's really lucky.
OTHERMALE:No, Mandy.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:You hang in there, girl.
LEADMALE:( melancholy theme playing ) It's not fair! It's not fair! It's not fair! Oh, no! What's happening? I'm growing! Mandy! Mandy, I don't wanna leave you now, please.
SUPMALE:Mandy, I don't wanna grow.
LEADMALE:( suspenseful theme playing ) Mandy! Mandy! Mindy! ( dramatic theme playing ) Oh.
LEADFEMALE:( sobbing ) MORK: Mindy! Mindy, Mindy! Mindy, Mindy, Mindy! Mindy, Mindy! Mork! ( crying ): Oh, Mork! I You've been gone three days! I thought you I thought you died.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, it's terrible.
LEADFEMALE:But it was wonderful too.
SUPMALE:I shrank down.
LEADFEMALE:I was in a little, tiny parallel universe.
OTHERFEMALE:( crying ) And everybody was there.
SUPMALE:Exidor and Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley and you were there.
LEADFEMALE:But you died.
LEADFEMALE:I It doesn't matter because you're back.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe it.
SUPMALE:( crying ) I missed you so.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:This This may be a little selfish of me, and I know no one lives forever, but I hope I I leave this life before you do, 'cause I never wanna lose you twice.
LEADMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( mysterious theme playing ) MORK: The molecules of the tablecloth became another universe.
LEADMALE:And the planet I landed on must have been just an atom.
LEADMALE:The society was advanced in some ways and backwards in others.
LEADMALE:And the people, oh, especially Mandy.
SUPFEMALE:Hum, boy ORSON: Mork, we've already discussed that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know that, your wideship.
SUPMALE:Mork, I know this may be painful, but tell me exactly how you felt when Mandy passed on.
SUPFEMALE:Hm.
OTHERFEMALE:Well I felt anger at first and anguish and a sense of deep loneliness.
SUPMALE:I can't even fully comprehend one emotion.
OTHERMALE:All those emotions at once.
LEADMALE:It must cause insanity.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it does at first, sir.
OTHERMALE:Then after you have time to think, you realize the good side.
SUPMALE:You realize that love can extend beyond universes and even beyond death.
LEADFEMALE:Till next week, sir.
LEADMALE:Nanu.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Nanu, nanu.
SUPMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( joyful theme playing ) ( imitates drill ) Mork, what did you do to the toaster? I'm preparing for that day when you throw me out with ( Southern accent ) nothin' but a fine-toothed comb.
LEADFEMALE:When you go, you're taking a ski, a slipper, and half a toaster? Yes, indeed.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you think that I read the papers and watch the TV? Listen, when I leave, I'm suing you for half of everything you own.
OTHERMALE:It's called "community property," baby.
LEADFEMALE:It's called the "Marvin Syndrome.
LEADMALE:" Well, I get half of everything you own, too, you know? Oh, so big deal.
OTHERFEMALE:Half of your Billy Barty poster.
LEADFEMALE:If you just take the top half, I still have a poster.
OTHERMALE:And I want half of your three bags of sand.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Now it's alimony.
LEADFEMALE:Please, don't throw me out.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do anything you want.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, look, Mork why were you worried that I was going to ask you to leave? Did I say something or do something? I've been reading the s-ss-ss I've been reading the s-ss-ss I looked at the figures on divorce, and the odds are against any couple staying together forever.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I know.
SUPMALE:I think that's kind of sad.
LEADMALE:That's probably because when people first get together, they're just crazy about each other, and then as time wears on, the excitement kind of wears off.
OTHERMALE:I'm still crazy about you.
LEADMALE:And I'm still crazy about you, too.
LEADMALE:Good, then we have nothing to fear but sanity itself.
LEADMALE:You've got nothing to worry about.
LEADMALE:Mindy, promise me that things will always stay exciting for us.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, I can't because they won't.
LEADMALE:But I think of it as getting comfortable, not humdrum.
OTHERFEMALE:What a coincidence.
LEADFEMALE:I used to play humdrum in my school band.
LEADFEMALE:I bet you did.
LEADMALE:( humming ) I'll bet you were great on the national anthem.
LEADFEMALE:The Orkan anthem has no music.
LEADFEMALE:It's three minutes of sucking through your teeth.
OTHERFEMALE:( sucking ) Yeah, well, you can't dance to ours either.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen, do you want to meet me for lunch this afternoon? Well, no, you see, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley invited me down to the mall to this new Italian restaurant called Della Contessa.
SUPMALE:I think that's delicatessen.
SUPFEMALE:( Italian accent ) Doesn't sound very Italian.
LEADMALE:It's owned by my girlfriend Jeanie and her brother.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley took me there and stuck me with lunch.
SUPFEMALE:Hope you didn't have shish kebab.
SUPFEMALE:Ar, ar.
LEADMALE:Well, I gotta go to class.
LEADMALE:Okay, Mork, I'll tell you what.
LEADMALE:I'll do my part to keep this relationship exciting.
SUPMALE:Tonight I will make us a romantic little Italian dinner for two.
SUPMALE:Well, I'll do my part in trying to keep the it exciting.
OTHERMALE:Tonight I'll put a bomb in your cannoli.
LEADFEMALE:( joyful theme playing ) ( clattering ) Snippy.
SUPMALE:Inconsiderate.
LEADMALE:Ungrateful chowderhead.
LEADFEMALE:Pigheaded, overbearing, ungrateful pea brain.
LEADFEMALE:I knew we shouldn't have moved out here.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? We would have had the same argument in New York.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, there, I could have given you a little pop.
SUPMALE:Here, I get arrested for "violatin' your space.
LEADFEMALE:" Remo, remind me when I become a doctor to open up your skull and see what makes ya thick.
LEADMALE:Ah.
SUPFEMALE:( sighs ) ( bell dings ) Enjoy.
LEADMALE:May I help you? Yeah.
SUPMALE:I'd like the bacon, lettuce, and tomato, with coleslaw and a cup of coffee, please.
LEADFEMALE:One BLT, one slaw, one java.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:How may I help you? May I ask you a question? Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's good.
SUPMALE:That's not the question.
LEADFEMALE:Um, do all the waitresses and cooks fight like you two? Only when the waitress has a brother with all the class of a Gong Show reject.
SUPFEMALE:What would you like to eat? Well, I'd like a squealer on a honky no goyam and a side of John darks.
LEADFEMALE:What? Oh, it's a ham on white, no mayonnaise, with lots of french fries.
LEADFEMALE:A number 3.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:What are you fighting about? Okay, look Remo was the last one out last night, and he forgot to lock up this place.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's like he wants us to get robbed so we'll have to close it and move back to the Bronx.
LEADMALE:You live with the Denver Broncos? Hello, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley.
LEADFEMALE:Bick, my main grump, what's happening? Hey, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley, what'll it be today? Uh, I think I'll have the fried chicken and a bowl of chili, all to go.
SUPFEMALE:MORK: I'll get it.
OTHERFEMALE:Chirp and a burp.
LEADFEMALE:Hotshot.
LEADFEMALE:Fire one.
LEADMALE:Oh, thanks, Bickley, for inviting me out to lunch.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I'm a prince.
SUPMALE:It seems like that waitress knows you.
SUPFEMALE:Jeanie? She should.
OTHERFEMALE:I've brought a new customer in here every day for lunch since they opened.
OTHERMALE:I hate to tell you this, they're having a terrible fight.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? Great.
LEADFEMALE:I love floor shows.
SUPMALE:I thought it's bad to fight with someone you care about.
OTHERMALE:Nah.
LEADMALE:It's a great way to keep a relationship fresh and exciting.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, exciting.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy and I never had a fight.
SUPMALE:Really? My wife and I used to fight like cats and dogs.
LEADMALE:She'd throw a plate at me, and I'd call her mother filthy names.
LEADMALE:And then she'd slam my lips in a drawer.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, those were the days.
SUPMALE:Uh, okay, number three here, and a chirp and burp.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Bick, you think Mindy and I can keep our relationship exciting like you and your wife? Sure.
OTHERMALE:The best thing two young kids could do is have a real rousing, knock-down, drag-out fight.
SUPMALE:Since you live upstairs from me, make it a quiet one.
SUPFEMALE:Were to.
SUPFEMALE:I was not the last one out last night.
OTHERMALE:You were.
LEADFEMALE:I was not.
LEADFEMALE:( in unison ) You were.
LEADMALE:REMO: You were.
LEADMALE:Remember you left one of your stupid medical books in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:You came back to get it.
SUPMALE:What do you mean my medical books are stupid? You should talk with all the dumb muscle magazines you read.
LEADFEMALE:What dumb muscle magazines? Those are physical fitness manuals.
OTHERMALE:Muscle, muscle, muscle.
SUPMALE:Don't push me.
LEADMALE:'Cause I'll do what you hate.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Remo, go flex yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, that's it.
LEADMALE:Fingernails on the blackboard.
LEADFEMALE:( screeching ) Ah.
LEADMALE:Remo.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know why I'm sendi" you through medical school.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, how are you gonna look at a lung if you can't look at a blackboard? Lungs don't squeak.
LEADFEMALE:Ow.
SUPMALE:What happened? Oh, I cut my finger on that dumb cheese grater.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, you big baby.
LEADMALE:It's just a scratch.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean, a scratch? That's a gash.
LEADMALE:Gashes almost always bleed.
SUPFEMALE:Well, give it a minute.
LEADMALE:Remo, look.
LEADMALE:Sit down here.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, you gotta be more careful with that thing.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I know.
LEADFEMALE:I just get in a hurry sometimes.
LEADMALE:Why, well, take it easy.
SUPFEMALE:Look, you sit here, have a soda, and I'll finish up with this stuff, okay? Hey, come here.
SUPMALE:Thanks, short stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Anytime.
OTHERFEMALE:Ow.
SUPFEMALE:You starin' at me? Yup.
SUPFEMALE:Yuh.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh-huh, uh-huh.
SUPMALE:You got some sort of problem, buddy? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:What's your name? Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Run that by me one more time.
SUPMALE:( deep voice ) I said Mork, already.
LEADMALE:Mork Allreddi? You Italian? Astral hatchling.
LEADFEMALE:New York, the east side.
SUPFEMALE:New Ork, dark side.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:How are ya? Nanu.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, na Yeah, nanu? Well, it's nice to know ya.
SUPMALE:It's nice to be known.
OTHERMALE:Could I ask you something personal? How personal is it? It's about your sister.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it, she's a med student.
LEADMALE:She'd only be interested in your pancreas.
LEADFEMALE:What I'd like to know is, you two were fighting hard, then you stopped.
OTHERFEMALE:Why? Oh, I cut my finger, and she's a sucker for blood.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, vampire, eh? Not your type, O.
LEADFEMALE:Ar, ar.
SUPMALE:Will you keep on fighting? Well, we're gonna have fights.
SUPFEMALE:But it's a way to get rid of pent-up frustrations.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, so these fights can be valuable? Sure.
SUPMALE:You argue, and then you kiss and you make up.
LEADMALE:Whoa-oa-oa.
SUPMALE:That sounds great.
LEADFEMALE:Who knows? If you have a real big fight ( upbeat theme playing ) Ah.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:You scared me to death.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm glad you're home.
LEADMALE:Dinner's almost ready.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you sit down, and I'll set it up.
LEADFEMALE:There's a little extra spaghetti sauce on the table if you want some more.
LEADFEMALE:And let's get the garlic rolls, and we'll be all set.
SUPMALE:You expect me to eat this slop? What is going on? You talk about more of the same.
LEADFEMALE:DÃ©jÃ  slop.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? I'm putting your buns in orbit, that's what I'm doing.
LEADFEMALE:What is wrong with you? I'm tired of eating food that the airlines would turn down.
LEADFEMALE:I've seen cockroaches go, "no way!" I thought you liked my cooking.
LEADMALE:You had a thought? Ar, ar, ar, ar.
OTHERMALE:Didn't think there was anything under that barbie-doll hairdo.
LEADMALE:Whoa, look: Echo.
OTHERFEMALE:Echo.
LEADMALE:Echo.
LEADMALE:Why don't you shave it all off and get yourself a mohawk? It would draw attention away from your nose.
OTHERMALE:My nose.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with my nose? It's shiksa city.
OTHERFEMALE:And your feet.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you get your shoes? Barnum and Bailey? Ah, ah, ah.
LEADMALE:And what's that wonderful fragrance? Oh, no, Old Spice.
LEADMALE:Ship ahoy, ship ahoy Maybe it's Indian leather.
SUPFEMALE:( Indian accent ) We make a fragrance from the cow that has been dead for four days and lying in the sun.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mindy, don't whimper.
OTHERMALE:It makes you look like a Pekingese with asthma.
SUPFEMALE:( panting ) It makes your eyes look even closer together.
OTHERMALE:( squeals ) Okay, it's your turn.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:I just can't believe ( sobbing ) Boy, this is gonna be great.
LEADFEMALE:( triumphant theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Mindy.
LEADMALE:Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Min.
LEADFEMALE:It was the best fight I've ever seen.
SUPFEMALE:Was it good for you too? Come on, now, it's time to kiss and make up.
OTHERMALE:Kiss and make up? I wouldn't kiss you if you were the only alien on earth.
LEADMALE:I think I am.
LEADMALE:Well, there's your proof.
SUPMALE:So, you don't like my cooking, huh? Well, if you don't like it, why don't you get off your face and cook something for yourself? Yeah.
SUPMALE:You don't know it's not that easy to be living with a monster from outer space.
OTHERMALE:Most guys just leave the cap off the toothpaste, right? You eat it.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, fight's over.
LEADMALE:King's X.
LEADMALE:Fight's over, my foot.
LEADMALE:So, you don't like my hairstyle, huh? Well, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Taste, where'd you get these rags, a fire sale at Disney World? She didn't mean it.
SUPMALE:Oh, and by the way, since we're into honesty, I'd like to inform you that your normal voice sounds like Truman Capote on helium.
LEADMALE:( imitating Mork ) I'm Mork from Ork.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu, nanu.
LEADMALE:( normal voice ) But you can just call me space turkey.
LEADFEMALE:Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar, ar.
SUPMALE:Ow.
LEADMALE:Ow.
OTHERMALE:See, I'm I'm cutting myself.
LEADFEMALE:Look, look, no blood.
LEADFEMALE:There will be.
SUPMALE:Blood, blood.
LEADFEMALE:Bleed, bleed.
LEADMALE:Mork, that's such a shame.
SUPFEMALE:We'll have to have that taken care of.
LEADMALE:I'll call the veterinarian.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, I think I've made a mistake.
SUPFEMALE:You made the mistake? I made the mistake.
LEADFEMALE:I should have listened to my father.
LEADMALE:I never should have let you move in here.
SUPMALE:If he told me once, he told me a million times: "Mindy, stick to your own species.
LEADMALE:" I guess I'll just go up to bed.
LEADFEMALE:Go up to bed, my foot.
LEADFEMALE:There is an egg leaving in 10 minutes.
SUPMALE:Be in it.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy.
SUPMALE:My lips aren't that long.
LEADMALE:Min, Min, Min.
LEADMALE:( knock on door ) REMO: Hey, we're closed.
SUPMALE:You gotta help me, please.
LEADMALE:It's a matter of life and death.
SUPFEMALE:Look, was there an accident? If anyone's hurt, I hope it's below the knee 'cause that's all I've studied.
LEADMALE:There was no accident, but two people really got hurt.
SUPMALE:Look, sit down, and just tell us what happened.
SUPMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, um I live with a very beautiful, wonderful girl named Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:Min Oh, I know Mindy.
LEADMALE:You must be Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, um, and she's fantastic for me, and we've never had a fight before.
LEADMALE:Today I saw you two having a fight.
SUPMALE:You said after the fight you kiss and make up.
SUPFEMALE:So I went home and tried it, but things didn't work out.
LEADMALE:So she got mad and threw me out of the house.
SUPFEMALE:And you can't kiss through a tiny lock unless you have little, little lips.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You mean, you started a fight, but you weren't mad at her? You're supposed to be mad? Whoa.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:It sounded like a wonderful game.
LEADMALE:I think I've ruined a wonderful thing.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you can go talk to her, negotiate.
LEADMALE:You'll be Kissinger, I'll be Sadat, she'll be Begin.
LEADMALE:Look, don't worry about it.
LEADFEMALE:Let me go and try and talk to Mindy, and see if I can explain things to her.
LEADMALE:And why don't you talk to our friend here about apologies? Hey, uh, it occurs to me that we haven't been formally introdu My name is Remo Da Vinci.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Leonardo's boy.
SUPMALE:Yeah, Leo's my pop.
LEADFEMALE:Look, um Mork When you, like, try and imitate me, you know, you gotta understand something.
LEADMALE:Yo, yo, yo.
SUPMALE:I'm a complex type of guy.
OTHERFEMALE:I operate on a whole bunch of different levels.
LEADMALE:Kind of like a surgeon in an elevator.
SUPMALE:You see, when my sister and I yell at each other, we're not really mad.
LEADFEMALE:And sometimes when people fight, you know, um They go too far like you did.
LEADFEMALE:And then there's got to be an apology, you know.
SUPFEMALE:So we're gonna make one up for ya.
LEADMALE:How do you do that? There are a couple of different ways you go on this apology thing.
LEADFEMALE:Um Oh, I don't know, you could, uh Oh.
LEADFEMALE:You could you could get her some flowers, or or maybe you could send her some candy.
LEADMALE:That'd be all right.
LEADFEMALE:That's no good.
SUPMALE:All the stores are closed by now.
LEADMALE:There must be some other way.
LEADMALE:Well, the best way is to I don't know, just to just to get a really big apology, you know.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna have to swallow your pride ( gulps ) You take a deep breath ( inhales ) And you just say, "I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:" ( high-pitched voice ) I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Look, just say you're sorry, like in your normal way.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Go ahead.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mindy, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I'm snake spit, I'm nothing, I'm low.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:I forgive you.
LEADMALE:Then we can kiss and make up.
SUPMALE:No, don't kiss me.
SUPFEMALE:( melodramatic theme playing ) Mindy, I got to apologize, 'cause the fight you had with Mork was all my fault.
LEADMALE:Actually, it was Remo's and my fault.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, it was all Remo's fault.
SUPMALE:Come on, Jeanie, how do you figure that? Remo convinced Mork that fighting was the best way to work out problems.
LEADFEMALE:Mork wasn't even angry.
SUPFEMALE:He wasn't? You know, all Mork said to me is that he wanted to keep things exciting between you two.
LEADMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:Mork said that? That's what he said.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, brother.
LEADFEMALE:I should've known.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, Mork really isn't capable of losing his temper.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know Mork that well, but right now, he's out there somewhere trying to figure out how to apologize.
SUPMALE:Mindy and I had our first fight.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations.
SUPMALE:No, it was horrible.
LEADFEMALE:I did the things like you said.
LEADFEMALE:I called her awful stuff, she called me terrible stuff, then she locked me out.
LEADMALE:Sounds like a reasonable first fight to me.
LEADMALE:Has a good beat, easy to yell to.
LEADFEMALE:I give it a 7.
SUPMALE:( laughs ) But I need your help, Bick.
SUPMALE:You see, y-you know more about fighting than anyone I know.
SUPMALE:How did you and your wife get to kiss and make up? We never did.
SUPFEMALE:Is that the way you're supposed to end an argument? It is, but ours never ended.
SUPMALE:It started the day we got married, and went on for 15 solid years without a letup.
SUPMALE:Oh, then what happened? One day, she threw me out of the house, locked the door, and I never saw her again.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you could help me write an apology of some sort.
SUPMALE:Apologize? That's the worst thing you can do.
SUPFEMALE:It's like admitting you were wrong.
LEADFEMALE:But I was wrong.
SUPFEMALE:Well, all the more reason to lie.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Let me write that down.
LEADFEMALE:Look, it depends on the situation.
LEADFEMALE:Once I missed our anniversary dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:I told my wife I forgot.
LEADFEMALE:But in a really tough spot, I always rely on natural disasters.
LEADMALE:Disasters.
LEADFEMALE:Late for a meeting, freak thunderstorm.
SUPMALE:Don't wanna go to your mother-in-law's house, avalanche.
LEADMALE:If that doesn't work, can I get a card? Maybe that'll help too.
LEADFEMALE:All right, if you think it'll do you any good.
OTHERMALE:I think I've got a Here.
LEADFEMALE:Here's an apology card for you.
SUPMALE:Aw, thanks, Bick.
SUPMALE:( knocking on door ) I bet I know who that is.
LEADMALE:I bet I do too.
LEADMALE:Now, Mindy, you give this guy a chance to apologize, 'cause it's the only thing that's gonna make him feel any better about this.
OTHERMALE:'s okay? 's okay.
SUPMALE:'s all right? 's all right.
OTHERMALE:Okay, open the door.
LEADMALE:Jeanie, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:You're welcome.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, Jeanie and I ( groaning ) Where am I? Where am I? What have I done? Who am I? Mork Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Who are you? Mindy.
SUPMALE:That's who you are.
SUPMALE:Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:And you wouldn't believe this, Mindy, I've had amnesia for the last 24 hours.
SUPMALE:And I hope I haven't said or done anything real stupid.
LEADMALE:You've had what? Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:It's catching.
SUPFEMALE:You poor little thing.
LEADFEMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:I don't have amnesia, and you don't have amnesia.
LEADMALE:Well, not now.
LEADMALE:It's a miracle.
SUPMALE:It's a miracle.
LEADFEMALE:I'm free.
LEADFEMALE:You saved me.
LEADMALE:You touched me, and I'm born again.
LEADMALE:I'm not buying it.
LEADFEMALE:You're not buying it? No.
SUPFEMALE:All right, the reason I I said all those awful things was, well There was a tidal wave.
LEADMALE:It picked me up.
LEADFEMALE:It just grabbed me.
OTHERFEMALE:I was in the middle of this great big wa ( imitating surfer ) it was really mellow.
SUPMALE:'cause I caught the wave.
LEADFEMALE:There I was about to be tubed, and I said, "wow.
LEADFEMALE:I'm there.
LEADFEMALE:" And I'm goin' down the side of this huge wave, and I said, "wow.
LEADFEMALE:Denver or bust.
OTHERFEMALE:" You know? It's gonna be incredible.
SUPFEMALE:That's amazing, Mork, because the nearest ocean is over a thousand miles away.
LEADFEMALE:A thousand miles away.
OTHERMALE:A long way.
SUPFEMALE:Well, the real reason I said those things is, you know, it's a full moon.
LEADMALE:Look what happened.
LEADFEMALE:See? Already it's taking effect.
LEADMALE:And I-I'm a weremork.
SUPFEMALE:I hate to tell you that, Mindy.
LEADMALE:( growling ) I believe this one, Mork.
LEADMALE:Tidal waves, full moons, and you're a weremork.
LEADFEMALE:You believe it? Then let's kiss and make up.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I thought our friendship was built on honesty.
SUPMALE:Don't you feel bad for making up these stupid stories? Yeah, I guess I should buy a house in San Clemente.
LEADMALE:Mork, if you're trying to apologize to me, why don't you just say what you feel in your heart? And if you do, I just might accept, and, uh, maybe we can kiss and make up.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Because I've got a lot of ways to apologize.
OTHERMALE:Here they are.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh-oh.
LEADFEMALE:What's this? It's my "bag," you know? I got you these chocolate kisses.
OTHERFEMALE:Be careful though, they leave little brown hickeys.
LEADMALE:That's all right, Mork.
SUPMALE:I accept your apology.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, I still have some more ways to apologize.
OTHERMALE:Here's a card that Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley wrote me.
LEADFEMALE:( clears throat ) "Hearing you were sickly, sailor, made my timbers shiver.
OTHERFEMALE:Hope you're getting over cirrhosis of the liver.
SUPFEMALE:" Mork, that isn't an apology card.
LEADMALE:Well, I saved the best for last.
LEADFEMALE:I really misunderstood about fighting.
LEADMALE:And I didn't know those things I was saying would be so awful, and I never meant them.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never, ever say them again as as long as I'm here.
LEADFEMALE:Will you forgive me? I forgive you, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, have we gone through all the possible apologies? The four possible ways to apologize on earth, but then there are the 83 Orkan methods.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, I forgive you.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERFEMALE:I have to suck my teeth through 10 choruses of the Orkan national anthem.
LEADFEMALE:Then I beat myself with a canary, then we go to Las Vegas, I pretend my right arm is longer than left.
LEADFEMALE:Mork I forgive you.
LEADMALE:Then we have to Don't press your luck.
OTHERFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) MORK: Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Yo, great cosmic pachyderm.
SUPFEMALE:( whistles ) I'm glad you called, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:The committee would like you to study something on earth called the "nuclear family.
LEADFEMALE:" Sir, are those the ones who have all the bombs? No.
SUPFEMALE:I'm talking about a mother, a father, a sister, and a brother.
LEADMALE:Well, sir, I'm halfway there.
LEADFEMALE:I met a sister and a brother, and they own a food factory called a "delicatessen.
OTHERFEMALE:" What do they manufacture? Oh, a wonderful thing called "sandwiches," sir.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sending you today's special in the express egg.
LEADFEMALE:It's a pastrami on rye with mayo.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Sir.
LEADMALE:Now, what happened with this family you met? Well, sir, I understand why you call them nuclear, because as soon as I met them, they blew up.
OTHERMALE:It must have been exceedingly messy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it was, sir.
LEADFEMALE:It caused a chain reaction, then Mindy and I had a fight.
OTHERMALE:Did you explode? No, sir, the both of us got hurt.
LEADFEMALE:See, what happened is, sir, I pretended to be mad, but then she really got mad.
LEADMALE:Did she knock the stuffing out of you? No, sir, you see it wasn't a physical fight.
SUPFEMALE:Here on earth, sometimes people throw words instead of punches, and it can be much more painful.
LEADFEMALE:That's why it's easier for a broken arm to mend than it is for a broken heart.
LEADMALE:This is Mork signing off until next week, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu, nanu.
OTHERMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu.
OTHERFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Hey, you know, Jeanie, I was thinking, uh, this deli would do a little more business if you had some kind of promotion.
SUPMALE:Maybe you could give away gasoline with every sandwich.
LEADMALE:Ha! They already get gas with the chili.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, something that would be like a reward to, uh, your few loyal customers.
OTHERMALE:Say, a discount on the food.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley thinks we should give him a discount.
LEADMALE:Yeah, say, Oh.
LEADMALE:You got it.
SUPFEMALE:Maurice, keep the engine running.
LEADMALE:Here's $100.
LEADFEMALE:Buy yourself a cigar.
SUPFEMALE:Here's $200.
LEADFEMALE:Buy yourself a haircut.
LEADFEMALE:Love you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what's going on here? Hey, Bick, here's $20 for that card I bought from you last Christmas.
LEADFEMALE:Love you, darling.
LEADFEMALE:What is this? It's Monopoly money.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:I don't want to pay you with that useless U.
OTHERMALE:S.
LEADMALE:currency.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
OTHERMALE:How'd you get to be so rich? Well, it's a long story.
LEADFEMALE:I'll make it real short.
OTHERFEMALE:I played Mindy in Monopoly last night, and I beat the chance off her.
OTHERMALE:( laughs ) I cleaned out her community chest.
SUPMALE:Always inspiring to see a good winner.
OTHERFEMALE:Gosh.
OTHERMALE:What are you gonna do with all your money? Maybe invest it.
LEADMALE:I don't want people to know that I'm loaded.
SUPFEMALE:I had the same problem.
LEADFEMALE:Remo, do you have any place where I can hide this? Oh, I've got the perfect place.
LEADMALE:Where I hide all my valuable potato peels and coffee grounds.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, excuse me, Daddy Warbucks.
LEADFEMALE:JEAN: I have a customer.
SUPFEMALE:Here you go.
SUPFEMALE:Well, now that I've got all this money, I don't know whether I should build a tax shelter, you know? I bought this book by Bert Lance: Having Fun With Other People's Money.
OTHERFEMALE:With all this scratch, I've been itching to go to Crab Nebula.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I hope you have fun.
LEADMALE:Well, who knows.
SUPMALE:You know, I've all those hotels, I built all those houses, but it's all so plastic.
LEADMALE:I don't know whether to invest in maybe, uh, public utilities or buy a railroad.
LEADMALE:What do you think? If you really want to know what to do with all that money, why don't you pay for my dinner? La-la-la ( sobs ) Ahem.
OTHERMALE:Ahem.
SUPFEMALE:A A hem and a sleeve.
SUPMALE:What's wrong? I mean, the service is slow, but don't let it bum you out.
SUPFEMALE:It's not just the service.
LEADFEMALE:It's It's my whole life.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a horrible failure.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe I can make you a better failure.
LEADMALE:Well, thanks, but there's no hope for me.
OTHERFEMALE:I came to Boulder to become a star.
SUPFEMALE:I wanted to sing and And to dance and to make movies.
OTHERFEMALE:You came to Boulder to become a star? Now I'm here.
LEADMALE:I'm all alone.
OTHERFEMALE:Got no money.
LEADMALE:Got no friends.
SUPMALE:( whimpers ) Hey, if you want a sugar daddy, I'm hypoglycemic.
LEADMALE:Hey, listen, I've got more money than J.
SUPFEMALE:Paul Getty put together.
SUPMALE:Hey, I'll be your friend.
LEADFEMALE:Really? That's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Could we start right away? Hey, even sooner.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you could come over to dinner at my house, say, like, around 7-ish? How about now-ish? Oh, that's great-ish.
SUPMALE:( both laugh ) REMO: Hey, Mork.
LEADMALE:You want your 5 grand back? No, keep it.
SUPMALE:It's just paper.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
SUPMALE:No, better than that.
LEADFEMALE:Throw it away.
SUPMALE:It's wrinkled.
SUPMALE:MORK: The other day I bought a huge car and said, "Throw it in the river.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to see it sink.
LEADMALE:" ( upbeat theme playing ) Mm, that was a wonderful meal, Kathy.
SUPMALE:I love a good pork butt.
SUPMALE:Well, thanks for the chow, and ciao.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, you can't go yet.
SUPFEMALE:Um, I've hardly gotten to know you.
LEADMALE:Why don't you come over here on the couch? Oh, dokey-okey.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa! Hup-ho! Five-point-0.
LEADMALE:You know, Mork, my heart really went out to you when I heard about your burden of having too much money.
LEADMALE:You know, it made my problem seem so small.
SUPMALE:Having no money.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Oh, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Mm, nice wine.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, and a good week too.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, a dollar doesn't go as far as it used to.
LEADFEMALE:Probably can't afford the gas.
OTHERFEMALE:Wah! You have a very kind face.
LEADMALE:Oh, and you have kind of a face too.
LEADMALE:Hoo-hoo! And your hair, ooh, it's so soft.
LEADMALE:That's because I gargle with lanolin.
SUPMALE:Would you like to dance? Oh, I'd love to.
LEADFEMALE:( imitates war-dance chant ) Adorable, Oh.
LEADMALE:Uh, why don't you put your arms around me? Oh, sure thing, Kimosabette.
LEADMALE:See? I never even touched you.
LEADMALE:You know, I can also stand on my lips.
LEADFEMALE:That's That's swell.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you know, I'm getting so tired.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you should go to bed, then.
LEADFEMALE:But I'd be so lonely.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Is there anything I can do to help? Mork, think about it.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I'm a woman, you're a man.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:And this is a dove.
LEADFEMALE:And here's a chicken.
LEADFEMALE:And this is a little lizard.
LEADMALE:( chuckles ) Boy, this is getting fun.
LEADMALE:Your turn.
LEADMALE:( clears throat ) Well, I know something that's a lot more fun, okay? Why don't you take off your suspenders.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Hey, that's no fun.
LEADFEMALE:I do that every night.
LEADMALE:Oh! Oh, it's getting so hot in here! Well, you know, when I get hot, I like to sit on a good cold Fudgsicle.
OTHERFEMALE:Doesn't everyone? Mork, I want you to spend the night here.
OTHERFEMALE:Why? ( enunciating ): Because I'm all alone.
OTHERFEMALE:I need somebody here.
SUPFEMALE:( enunciating ): All right, I'll do it.
SUPMALE:But do you have an attic? ( normal voice ): I don't have an attic.
LEADFEMALE:( normal voice ): All right.
SUPMALE:I'll rough it here, right on Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Couch.
OTHERMALE:But what about my Mr.
SUPMALE:Bed? I don't think there's room for the couch.
LEADMALE:Well Besides, where would you sleep? Fine.
LEADMALE:Fine, fine.
OTHERFEMALE:But you know where I am should you need me.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just whistle.
LEADMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( sighs ) ( sighs ) Well, thanks a lot, Jeanie.
LEADFEMALE:If you see him, will you tell him to call me? Yeah, I I won't.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, thanks.
SUPMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, it's you! You're right! Johnny Olson, tell her what she's won! Thanks, Carl.
LEADFEMALE:She's just won a Naugahyde wig.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Naugahyde, the wig of the champions.
OTHERMALE:Well, where have you been? What have you been doing? Nothing.
SUPMALE:Nothing? You were gone all night.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I met a lonely actress.
LEADFEMALE:And? Well, she asked me over for dinner.
SUPMALE:Did you go? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:I was hungry.
LEADFEMALE:So, what happened after dinner? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:We just sat on the couch, that's all.
LEADMALE:That's all? Oh, pretty much, yeah.
LEADMALE:There was a little dancing and then, uh, I put my arms around her.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you did, did you? Yeah.
LEADMALE:And then I took off my suspenders, and she got a little overheated.
LEADMALE:She took off her top, and then, boom, she wanted to go to bed.
SUPMALE:Well? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I just spent the night with her, that's all.
SUPFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, what's wrong? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:( dramatic theme playing ) ( knock at door ) Entre nous.
SUPFEMALE:Kathy.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ): Mork.
OTHERMALE:You know, I'm a little disappointed.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you were gonna be my friend.
LEADFEMALE:One evening, and I don't see you for two weeks? Well, I I thought you only needed a friend for one night.
LEADMALE:You're forgiven.
OTHERMALE:You know, somehow I imagined your place would be, well, more expensive-looking.
SUPMALE:Well, it's not mine.
LEADFEMALE:It belongs to the girl I live with.
SUPFEMALE:A girl, huh? And does this girl know about the night you spent with me? Oh, yes, I told Mindy all about it.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Very good.
SUPMALE:You know, Mork, I've been thinking about you a lot these past two weeks, and that night we spent together had a lot of meaning for me.
SUPMALE:What did it mean to you? Mm, let's see Pork butt.
LEADFEMALE:Good dancing, lumpy sofa.
LEADMALE:Are you trying to say you love me? I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Mork, ahem, I wasn't gonna bring this up, but you have torn it out of me.
LEADMALE:Will you marry me? ( gasps ): This is so sudden! Hi.
LEADMALE:Well, who's this? Remember I told you about that girl I spent the night with, the one with the bad thermostat? Mindy, this is Kathy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mork and I were just talking about getting married.
LEADMALE:Ah-ha-ha! You were? No, she were.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Kathy, um, I don't think you understand.
LEADFEMALE:You see, uh, Mork and I have been living together for quite some time now, and Mork sometimes doesn't grasp the complexities of personal relationships.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I'm sure you're a very nice girl, but somewhere along the way, I think you've gotten your wires crossed.
LEADMALE:Mindy, dear, I don't think you understand.
LEADFEMALE:I'm having Mork's baby.
LEADMALE:La-la-la ( upbeat theme playing ) Well, I hope you're at least gonna do the right thing by me.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it's gonna take a lot of money to raise our child properly after we're married.
LEADFEMALE:Married? Oh, if I marry her, can I still keep living with you? Thanks for the offer, Mork, but I think I'll pass.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'd like to still keep living with Mindy.
OTHERMALE:Would you take money instead? What a cruel thing to say.
LEADMALE:But then, life is cruel, isn't it? Okay.
SUPMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Here's 15 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's funny.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that's very, very funny.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you listen, buster, you're gonna have a paternity suit on your hands if I don't get $5,000 in 24 hours.
SUPMALE:Oh, listen, I'm no legal bozo.
LEADFEMALE:How about a compromise? Five thousand hours to give you $24.
LEADFEMALE:This guy's hysterical.
OTHERMALE:Well, before you start talking about lawsuits, you'd better be able to prove that he's the father.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, even if I can't prove it, I can make his life miserable in court, and I guarantee it won't seem so funny when his name is plastered all over the newspapers.
SUPMALE:( door closes ) Oh, Mork, what have you done? Well, I guess I know what you've done, but Well, Mindy, what am I gonna do? Well, Mork, to tell you the truth, I don't think I'm the one to advise you at this time.
LEADFEMALE:Somehow, I just find it a little difficult to be objective.
LEADMALE:Oh, I don't want to marry somebody that's not Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:REMO: Come on.
LEADMALE:It'll help promote business.
LEADFEMALE:JEAN: Remo Please, just Just try on the sarong.
SUPFEMALE:If it worked for Lamour, it'll work for la less.
LEADMALE:Remo, the flower, yes.
LEADMALE:The sarong, never.
LEADFEMALE:It's not like it's topless.
LEADFEMALE:Ha! It's just tasteless.
SUPFEMALE:But then, how can you discuss taste with a man who looks like he walked out of a Don Ho nightmare? You say anything, and you're the daily special.
LEADFEMALE:REMO: Mork! Hawaii! A little depressed.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa, Remo, what happened? Did Picasso throw up on you? Thanks, it's great to see you too.
LEADMALE:What's the matter with you? Well, I'm thinking of getting married.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, you got troubles.
OTHERFEMALE:Sit down.
SUPFEMALE:And you're lucky.
LEADFEMALE:Today I'm dressed like a Hawaiian psychiatrist.
LEADFEMALE:All right, what's the deal? Well, I I I'm thinking of getting married.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm excited for you.
SUPMALE:In fact, I think it's terrific, and I know Mindy's real happy too, huh? I don't think she likes the girl too much.
SUPFEMALE:Wha? What girl? Well, the one that's having my baby.
LEADFEMALE:How did that happen? Well, it was an accident.
SUPMALE:I wish you could get coverage for that type of collision.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but let's be hypothetical for a moment.
LEADFEMALE:What would happen if, uh, Jeanie, you know, um? You know, uh? You know, got in trouble? I'd kill the guy! Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'd kill him, and I'd force him to marry her.
SUPMALE:Feel like I'm wearing a doggy bag from a luau.
OTHERMALE:Jeanie, will? Will you cover yourself up? And stay away from him.
LEADMALE:Well, gladly, and why? Well, um, he got a girl, uh Fat.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:In the family way.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I think she wants to get married.
LEADMALE:I can't believe this.
SUPFEMALE:But if you did it, marrying her is the honorable thing to do.
SUPMALE:Of course, it's your decision, Mork.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I do want to do the honorable thing.
OTHERMALE:I guess I'd better marry her tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Better start making some phone calls.
SUPMALE:I guess you have a lot of plans to make, huh? Right.
LEADFEMALE:You're darn tooting.
LEADFEMALE:The first thing I want to do is find out her last name.
LEADMALE:Can you imagine? Mr.
LEADMALE:and Mrs.
LEADMALE:( mumbles ) ( upbeat theme playing ) ( knock ) MORK: Yoo-hoo! It's me, lumpy boy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm glad you agreed to settle things right away.
LEADFEMALE:Now, where's the money? Money? What money? We're getting married.
LEADFEMALE:Getting married? But on the phone, you said that That That you were gonna take care of everything.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I am, little uzzy-wuzzums.
LEADFEMALE:I'm also gonna take care of our little bundle de joie.
LEADFEMALE:There is no little There is no reason for us to get married.
LEADFEMALE:With your money, I can take care of the fuzzy bundle all by myself.
SUPMALE:I wouldn't think of it, sugar lumps.
SUPFEMALE:Don't call me that.
OTHERFEMALE:Why not? I mean, pretty soon we're gonna be husband and wife and you're gonna be my little boojums and I'm gonna be your Uncle Squeezers.
SUPMALE:Listen, I don't think you really understand quite what's going on here.
SUPFEMALE:Mork Mm-hm? I'm not good enough for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Oh, I mean, you can't throw away your whole life just because you made one little mistake.
SUPMALE:But after we're married, I can sleep on the couch again, and we'll have lots of little mistakes.
OTHERMALE:Reconsider.
LEADMALE:Reconsider.
LEADMALE:No, I Oh, you sly boots.
SUPFEMALE:You're more anxious than I am.
LEADMALE:You're already ready to go on the honeymoon.
LEADFEMALE:Turlock, here we come.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:This isn't going right at all.
SUPMALE:( knock at door ) Who's that? Either the pope or a justice of the peace.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Sorry I'm late.
LEADFEMALE:The bus doesn't stop at this corner.
LEADMALE:Hello, I'm Mork.
OTHERMALE:I'm Justice Aaron Abbott.
LEADMALE:You know, I found him at the beginning of the telephone book.
SUPMALE:He's the top of his field.
LEADMALE:And this is? Oh, Kathy, my lovely bride-to-be.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't catch your last name yet.
LEADFEMALE:Cumberland.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, like the gap.
LEADMALE:Boy, I hope Mindy gets that note I left.
OTHERFEMALE:I wouldn't want her to miss this.
LEADFEMALE:KATHY: Mork.
LEADMALE:Mork, you don't even know what I'm like.
LEADMALE:I mean, I have these rotten, filthy, awful habits.
LEADMALE:I I drool in my sleep.
SUPMALE:That's all right.
LEADMALE:I'll wear rubber pajamas.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I didn't want to lay this on you, but I run around with men.
OTHERMALE:Uh-oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Shouldn't jog when you're preggers.
SUPFEMALE:( knock at door ) Who's that? Could be the pope now.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, friends of the bride or the groom? Uh Uh, the groom.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, can I talk to you for a minute, Mork? I know that you think you know what you're doing, but I know you don't really know what you think that you know.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, you tell him.
LEADMALE:Mork, can you? Can you take a little constructive criticism? Sure.
SUPMALE:This is the stupidest thing you've ever done.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I guess that means you're not bringing a wedding present.
OTHERMALE:Mork, Mork, Mork, you don't owe that bimbo anything.
OTHERFEMALE:You have your whole life ahead of you.
LEADFEMALE:You're a young man.
LEADFEMALE:You've got your health.
LEADMALE:You have your friends.
SUPFEMALE:Your brains are a little shaky.
SUPFEMALE:But it's the honorable thing to do.
LEADMALE:That's another strike against you.
OTHERFEMALE:You tell him.
LEADMALE:Mork I am really gonna miss you.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, I hate to do this, but it's my duty.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork.
SUPMALE:Eh Excuse me, can we get started? Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure thing.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:No, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I've been thinking.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we could raise the kid for $4,000.
SUPMALE:He doesn't have to go to college.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't think of it.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Twenty-five hundred.
SUPFEMALE:He doesn't have to go to high school.
LEADFEMALE:I want to do the right thing.
LEADFEMALE:A thousand dollars! That's my final offer.
LEADFEMALE:Eternal bliss and marriage to me forever.
SUPMALE:That's my final offer.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you could ruin the rest of your life.
LEADMALE:Well, what about the rest of my life? ABBOTT: Could we? Dearly beloved I do.
SUPFEMALE:Not yet.
LEADMALE:I don't.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:( whispers ): Five hundred, and you'll never hear from me again.
OTHERMALE:( whispers ): Sounds like a good deal to me.
LEADMALE:No, I buttered my bread, and now I'm gonna lie in it.
LEADFEMALE:Dearly beloved, we are gathered Oh, this is ridic ( clears throat ): Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to witness the union of this man and this woman.
SUPMALE:We have come to join them in the bonds of holy matrimony Oh, nothing kinky yet, please.
SUPMALE:If there's anyone here who would object to this marriage, let them speak now or forever hold their peace.
LEADMALE:I object.
SUPFEMALE:I object.
SUPMALE:I object.
OTHERFEMALE:That's three.
SUPFEMALE:Fifty dollars, bus fare, and I'm gone.
SUPFEMALE:But gungabooby, I would if I could, but I haven't got $50.
LEADFEMALE:It's all in stocks? No, it's in pants.
SUPFEMALE:It's in my pocket.
OTHERMALE:Fifteen big ones.
SUPMALE:You're not rich? Eh.
LEADMALE:You mean I wasted all this time, and you're not even rich? Now I object.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I can still catch the 8:15 bus.
SUPFEMALE:Better have that taken care of.
SUPMALE:Somebody might trip.
OTHERMALE:ABBOTT: Whoa! ( crash ) Well, I'll finish the ceremony.
LEADMALE:Do you promise to love, honor, and obey till one of us bites the big one? Will you stop it? He never even laid a hand on me.
LEADMALE:Don't they call this "extortion"? Eh.
SUPFEMALE:You were extorting my baby? What a horrible way of saying you You love me.
LEADMALE:No, Mork, there is no baby.
SUPMALE:There never was.
SUPMALE:( stutters incoherently ) Shock, bewilderment, confusion.
SUPFEMALE:Why did you want to marry me? I think we'll let her explain that to the police.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:You're not getting away with this one this time, Miss Honey Lumps.
LEADMALE:Oh, uh, you know, you are a very attractive man.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like to get a bite to eat? Are you buying? I know this place where I can get a 10-percent discount.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Min, just when I think I understand you Earthlings, some weirdness comes along and, zammo.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:The problem is you're a magnet for weird.
SUPMALE:That woman thought you were rich, and she was out to get your money.
SUPFEMALE:She never thought you were gonna marry her.
SUPMALE:But wouldn't any human being do that? No.
OTHERFEMALE:See, that's one of the other reasons you have so much trouble.
LEADFEMALE:You're just not fully human yet.
SUPFEMALE:That's also one of the reasons I think you're so special.
SUPFEMALE:I think you're special.
LEADMALE:I guess I guess that means that you're not fully human yet either.
SUPMALE:Well, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's too bad about Kathy.
SUPFEMALE:I had this incredible honeymoon planned.
LEADMALE:Now we can't go on it.
LEADMALE:Maybe you'd like to go.
OTHERMALE:Well, maybe I would.
LEADFEMALE:Where were you gonna go? Well, we were gonna go to Three Mile Island.
LEADMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:ORSON: Here I am, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:What's been going on? Well, this week, sir, I learned that on Earth, things aren't always what they appear to be.
LEADMALE:You'll have to explain that.
SUPMALE:I will, sir.
LEADFEMALE:For example, the ocean appears to be clean, new cars appear to be well-built, and Ronald Reagan appears to have brown hair.
LEADMALE:That's very complicated.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it gets worse, sir.
LEADMALE:There's double deceptions, like the government appears to be disorganized, and it is.
SUPMALE:What does all this have to do with your week? I was about to tell you, your testiness.
LEADMALE:I met a woman who wasn't what she appeared to be.
LEADMALE:Who was that lady? ( imitating Groucho Marx ): That was no lady.
SUPFEMALE:That was almost my wife.
LEADFEMALE:( normal voice ): On Earth, some humans believe that they should be married before they get pregnant.
SUPMALE:Why is that so important? Well, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:It must be too expensive to take the children along on the honeymoon.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm proud of you for trying to do the right thing in spite of the consequences, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, sir.
SUPMALE:I I believe that I should take responsibility for the things that I do.
LEADMALE:Main problem is I can't figure out whether I did them or not.
LEADFEMALE:Ar-ar-ar-ar.
LEADFEMALE:Well, until next week, nanu, nanu.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu! ( upbeat theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Mindy: I don't think it was such a bad idea for a promotion "A night in Acapulco.
LEADMALE:" Okay, okay, so I blew it, but I gotta figure out a way to get some customers in this place.
OTHERMALE:Okay, guinea pig, could you flex your tendon? I thought you'd never ask.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? Don't put your feet on the table.
SUPFEMALE:I gotta serve food here.
SUPFEMALE:I am studying to be a doctor.
LEADFEMALE:Comprende? Yeah, I know.
OTHERFEMALE:You got a perfect patient here Your brother's business is dying.
SUPMALE:All right, everybody, mellow out! It's officer mork here, of the "Right on" police.
LEADMALE:You know, I've been really picking up some bad vibes on my vibrational meter, and I'm not gonna bust you because that's really a downer, okay? I'm gonna put you under gestalt arrest.
LEADFEMALE:It's a thing, where Hey, I've got some handcuffs.
LEADMALE:If you don't wanna wear them, you don't have to.
LEADFEMALE:If you want to, I'll fasten them real tight What is all this? What, you didn't know? Mork got a new job.
LEADFEMALE:He's the night watchman at the science exhibition.
LEADMALE:Heh, that should set science back about 200 years.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Nice-looking gams, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Gams? Pens, stems, pipes.
SUPMALE:So, Mork-O, have a seat here.
SUPFEMALE:Remo.
SUPMALE:Sounds like you found a job you really like.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm proud of ya.
SUPMALE:I can keep it as long as I do the two things I'm supposed to.
OTHERMALE:One thing is to make my rounds, the other is to keep my hands off the science exhibits.
LEADFEMALE:How's it going? Well, one out of two ain't bad.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-oh.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, spill it.
LEADMALE:Well, there's this really cute old robot there, and I've I've reprogrammed him to play games and talk.
LEADFEMALE:He always wins, but it's better than playing mumbletypeg with a laser.
SUPMALE:Mork, you know you probably shouldn't be fooling around with the science exhibits.
LEADFEMALE:Well, no one really cares about him, except for me.
LEADMALE:Hold it a minute.
LEADMALE:Telling me you've reprogrammed some sort of robot.
SUPMALE:Are you kidding? It's really simple.
OTHERMALE:All you have to do is adjust the circuitry to accommodate new diodes, and, probably, if it's at night, it's a nocturnal emission, which is kind of embarrassing for a robot.
SUPFEMALE:And besides that, The real tricky part is synchronizing your polarity with your binder encronometers.
LEADMALE:If you do that, You either get a robot that talks, or a Cuisinart.
LEADFEMALE:I knew that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I I guess I'm off.
LEADMALE:Remo, Huh? How did that "Night in Acapulco" go? Oh, not too good.
LEADMALE:No one thought it looked like authentic Mexico in here.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that's easy, all you have to do is bust people as they leave.
LEADFEMALE:Ciao! See ya.
OTHERMALE:MORK: I see you $2 million, and raise you the moon.
LEADFEMALE:(monotone robotic voice): Too rich for my hydraulic system.
LEADFEMALE:I win the known universe with a pair of 2s.
LEADMALE:What did you have? Let's see here.
LEADMALE:Whoa! Four aces.
SUPMALE:Couldn't have won with that, anyway.
SUPMALE:How did you know I was bluffing? Actually, I could see your cards in your dome.
SUPFEMALE:Shazbat! Well, I can't teach you everything, Chuckela.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, could we talk for a moment, in private? Private's locked.
SUPMALE:Lab rats are drugged.
SUPFEMALE:What's up, Chuck? I want to thank you for programming me for consciousness.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, it's no big deal.
LEADMALE:I was kinda lonely.
LEADMALE:I needed someone to talk to.
OTHERMALE:Something very strange has happened.
LEADMALE:Yesterday, after you left, I experienced a condition which seemed to dictate the necessity of your presence.
SUPFEMALE:Chuck you missed me.
LEADFEMALE:Missed you? But that's impossible.
LEADFEMALE:Robots function purely by logic.
OTHERFEMALE:I have no emotions.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you've got them now.
LEADMALE:I didn't mean to give them to you, but I guess that comes with having a conscience.
LEADMALE:Well, I shouldn't have emotions.
SUPFEMALE:They conflict with my computer banks.
LEADFEMALE:I used to think the same way, Chuck, but now I'm up to my ears in 'em.
LEADFEMALE:You've probably got a few of them swimming inside.
LEADFEMALE:They're just itching to get out.
SUPFEMALE:Cootchy, cootchy, cootchy.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe that is what caused the other strange thing.
LEADFEMALE:When you came in last night, you smiled at the newer robot, and I wanted to scratch out his cathodes.
LEADFEMALE:Chuck, you were jealous.
LEADFEMALE:These emotions have names? Yes, and I know them all personally.
OTHERFEMALE:Is it good to be jealous? Well, It's good to have emotions, but jealousy's not one of the better ones.
SUPMALE:Why are you jealous of XLG-15? Because he is shiny and new, and technologically perfect, and I am going to be dismantled next week.
LEADMALE:Why, Chuck-O? Metal fatigue.
LEADMALE:They say rusty old robots like me should be destroyed.
OTHERFEMALE:Who are they? They're not gods.
SUPFEMALE:Just because they created you, doesn't give them the right to do that.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, calm down.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone is only here temporarily.
LEADMALE:Even that brand-new, shiny robot will wear out someday.
SUPMALE:But the only thing that's tough, is I've I've just found out I'm going to be dismantled, and I've just found out what it is to be alive.
LEADMALE:Chuck, how can you take it so calmly? They must know what they are doing.
SUPFEMALE:They feel I should be taken apart, before I fall apart.
OTHERFEMALE:The only flaw in their logic is, I am not falling apart! ( metal clangs ) What was that, Chuck? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:My stomach was rumbling.
LEADFEMALE:Let's change the subject.
SUPFEMALE:Anything you say.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:All right, uh, let's play another game.
LEADMALE:We've played poker, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:We'll play, um, "I spy.
LEADFEMALE:" You be Robert Culp, I'll be Bill Cosby, all right? Sure! I spy with my little eye, something beginning with the letter "a.
SUPFEMALE:" Whoa, great impression of Linda Blair.
SUPMALE:Acetylene torch.
LEADMALE:Hot, but no way.
SUPFEMALE:( laughs ) These emotions are interesting.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to experience more of them.
LEADFEMALE:Adhesive tape! Sticky, but no banana.
LEADMALE:You'll never get emotions if you're cramped up in this tiny, cooped up space all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess if you're not gonna guess it, then I'll have to tell you.
LEADFEMALE:It was air.
SUPMALE:Oh! But it's supposed to be something you can see.
SUPFEMALE:You can't see air.
LEADMALE:Ah, then you've never been to Los Angeles.
LEADMALE:All right, you win.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:I spy with my little eye, something beginning with "f.
SUPFEMALE:" "F.
LEADFEMALE:" Floor! No.
SUPFEMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:Oh, I wish I could get out of here, so I could experience some more emotions.
OTHERMALE:Mmm! I want to live! I want to dance! I want to shake my booty! ( yawns ) ( light theme playing ) Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Mork! What are you doing home so early? It's not early.
LEADFEMALE:It's 5:00 in the morning.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I must have fallen asleep, while watching that movie.
SUPFEMALE:What were you watching? Oh, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Some old tear-jerker.
SUPMALE:My favorite love story is "Mothra vs.
LEADFEMALE:Godzilla.
LEADMALE:" I always cry when Tokyo gets destroyed.
LEADMALE:Same old story, though.
LEADFEMALE:Boy meets city, boy loses city.
LEADFEMALE:Tiny girls sing Mothra Well, how was work? Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, remember that old robot called Chuck, I was telling you about? They named the robot Chuck? Well, no one calls him "Chas.
LEADMALE:" Remember I programmed him to play games and talk? Well, now he's accidentally got feelings.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't think robots had feelings.
LEADMALE:I didn't think Orkans did, but Now he's got them, he wants to experience everything.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe you could fix him up with Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley's dishwasher.
LEADMALE:Now he's not a machine, anymore.
SUPMALE:He's a being.
LEADMALE:He wants to meet people.
LEADMALE:He wants to party hearty.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what you're getting yourself into, but this whole thing sounds pretty strange to me.
LEADMALE:Have you ever heard the story of Frankenstein? Oh, yeah, it's an incredible love story.
LEADMALE:Mork, besides being a love story, what it was about, was if you tamper with a monster, then Chuck's not a monster! He's no Robert Redford, but The point is, Mork Is that Frankenstein was given feelings, and he didn't know how to handle them, and he got himself into a lot of trouble.
LEADFEMALE:So you're implying that Chuck is going to strangle innocent townspeople? What I'm saying is that it might end up hurting itself, or maybe somebody else, and it might end up costing you your job.
LEADFEMALE:Listen.
LEADFEMALE:I know a lot about Chuck.
SUPFEMALE:He's my best friend.
LEADMALE:I know him very, very well, and He hasn't got a vicious circuit in his body.
LEADFEMALE:He wouldn't harm anything.
LEADFEMALE:( knocking ) ( tense theme playing ) It's for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Mindy, this is Chuck the robot.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, that would have been my guess.
LEADFEMALE:Greetings, Mindy.
LEADMALE:I am sorry about the door.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, it's my fault.
LEADFEMALE:I never should leave it closed.
LEADFEMALE:It's all right, Chuck-O.
LEADMALE:We'll just put a two-foot peephole in.
LEADFEMALE:Perfect for 600-pound Avon ladies.
LEADMALE:(husky voice): Wanna buy some makeup? ( laughs ) So, this is a home.
LEADFEMALE:No, this is an apartment.
LEADFEMALE:A home is where he belongs.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in, Chuck.
SUPFEMALE:Take a load off your hinges.
OTHERFEMALE:There we go.
LEADMALE:Oh, dear.
SUPMALE:Ohh.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Mork, I think that your friend, uh, Chuck, should go back to the science fair.
SUPMALE:Come on, Mindy.
SUPMALE:Let him stay.
SUPFEMALE:He's a friend.
LEADFEMALE:He needs a place to stay.
SUPMALE:Please, please, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Oh, gee, Mork.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:No way! But maybe we all could get together, and have lunch sometime.
LEADFEMALE:You act like you're afraid of Chuck.
SUPMALE:(laughs): Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Come here, don't be afraid.
LEADMALE:Come here, touch him.
LEADMALE:Listen, this couldn't harm you.
LEADFEMALE:Watch.
LEADFEMALE:Chuck, kill! See, he didn't do anything.
SUPMALE:Lassie would have been at your throat by now.
SUPFEMALE:Chuck, say hello.
OTHERMALE:Hello, Mindy.
LEADMALE:You're very pretty.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:And you're very metallic.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, please, let me stay.
OTHERMALE:I I was kidding myself before, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:I am rusting away.
LEADMALE:There's not going to be anything wrong with you, there's nothing wrong with you.
SUPFEMALE:With the time I have left, I want to find out what life is all about.
OTHERMALE:I I need to be with warm, caring people.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Chuck and I, We're We're real, real good buddies.
LEADMALE:You bet! See? He likes me.
SUPMALE:No, no, Chuck.
LEADFEMALE:That's all right.
SUPMALE:I'll get up.
LEADMALE:Mork, he has to go back before he's missed.
LEADMALE:Well, the exhibit doesn't open until next Monday.
OTHERMALE:No one's going to miss me over the weekend.
LEADMALE:Except maybe the Coke machine, but she's only nice for money.
LEADMALE:Mindy, please let him stay.
OTHERMALE:He'll be the perfect houseguest.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't eat, doesn't sleep, doesn't smell after three days.
SUPFEMALE:And he only uses the bathroom to change his oil.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's a good one, Mork.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mindy, isn't he a fantastic audience? Uh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Just like having Vegas in your own home.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy, how can I thank you for letting me stay here? Oh, any way you want, as long as it's from over there.
LEADFEMALE:'Scuse me, Mork.
LEADMALE:Mindy, please.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's make Chuck feel at home.
LEADMALE:Tell you what.
OTHERFEMALE:You go fluff up the toolbox, and I'll make some STP daquiri.
OTHERMALE:Mary had a little Bel, il, uh, schnuzz, ughhh.
SUPMALE:I beg your pardon? Oh, he said, "Mary had a little Bel, shnoot, ugh.
SUPFEMALE:" Aren't you into literature? That's the poetry of Billy Carter.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:My brain seems to wander once in a while.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not as young as I used to be.
LEADMALE:In 1492, Columbus invented the cotton gin.
OTHERMALE:He is in bad shape.
LEADMALE:Well, he's not well, but he'll get better.
SUPFEMALE:I promise.
LEADFEMALE:He will.
LEADMALE:Well, how long has this been happening? Uh, how long has what been happening? See? I'm well enough, Mork, for someone whose time has almost come.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, don't talk like that, Chuck.
LEADMALE:You're still vital.
OTHERMALE:You're the original man of steel.
LEADFEMALE:On the outside, maybe, but inside, I have metal fatigue.
SUPFEMALE:Even Geritol with iron will not help.
SUPFEMALE:( sighs ) Is there anything that we can do to help? Oh, I want to find out what life is all about.
OTHERMALE:I have feelings, and I want to use them.
LEADMALE:Abraham Lincoln was the 16th president, and the inventor of the Continental.
SUPFEMALE:I never thought I'd be feeling sorry for a robot.
SUPMALE:Oh, please, don't feel sorry for me.
LEADMALE:Just help me make what time I have left meaningful.
SUPFEMALE:Ohhh, I want to feel useful.
SUPMALE:There must be something a robot can do, besides just being another exhibit at a science fair.
SUPMALE:Mindy, you may have just licked that problem with that cute little tongue of yours.
SUPFEMALE:How would you like to be the main attraction at a delicatessen? Will I learn more about feelings there? No, you'll learn about the most intense emotion of them all.
SUPFEMALE:You mean love? No, heartburn.
SUPFEMALE:REMO: Step right up! I want you to see the scientific wonder of the century.
LEADMALE:Chuck the robot's gonna be here in a minute.
LEADMALE:This is great.
SUPFEMALE:Getting a robot to lure in these people.
LEADMALE:Mork, you're a genius! Oh, you're too modest.
SUPFEMALE:And somebody thought this was the dumbest idea he'd ever heard.
LEADMALE:Look, it's no disgrace to be a septic, okay? Skeptic.
OTHERFEMALE:Tanks.
SUPMALE:How was I supposed to know the robot could talk? Oh, well Remo, anything's possible! You learned.
LEADMALE:Heh, heh.
SUPMALE:You know what it means, when I put my thumb in my teeth like this, huh? Yes, that you're too short to reach your nose.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's a good one.
OTHERMALE:You're learning from me.
SUPMALE:You're learning from me.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:All right, already.
LEADMALE:We'd better bring him out, now.
LEADMALE:They seem to be getting a little restless, and full.
LEADFEMALE:May I have your attention, ladies and gentlemen.
LEADMALE:We are about to bring out Chuck the robot.
OTHERFEMALE:( applause ) ( cheering ) But first, how about a A piece of this delicious strawberry cheesecake? We're going to can the commercial break, that lady's doing a nasty thing to the salami, making a weapon.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Chuck-O! Get ready, baby! Here he comes, here he comes! ( applause ) ( cheering ) Ahhh, so, this is what life is all about.
LEADMALE:Chuck, my main machine, slam me some tin, baby! Whoa! Heavy metal! Ladies and gentlemen, let me present Chuck the robot! ( cheering ) He's gonna answer any of your questions, and solve any of your problems.
SUPFEMALE:So, where's the restroom? That is not my problem.
SUPFEMALE:( laughter ) They laughed.
SUPFEMALE:They must like me.
LEADFEMALE:Are you kidding? You're killin' them.
LEADFEMALE:I can see Variety tomorrow.
LEADMALE:"Garners big yuks.
LEADMALE:Arranged to gather for confab.
LEADMALE:Five big deals.
LEADMALE:" Thank you all for coming especially the fat lady.
LEADMALE:What? That's a little bit intense, Chuck-O.
LEADFEMALE:You're being a little too realistic, there.
LEADFEMALE:But I I I don't know why I said that.
SUPMALE:Look, uh, Chuck, I think, maybe, that you better go and apologize, okay? Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:Lady, I am sorry you are fat.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, Mork, I did it again! That's it, I'm leavin'! Wait, wait.
SUPMALE:And don't look too close for the tip! How about some cheesecake? I thought you said this was gonna help business.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong, Chuck? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mr.

LEADMALE:What's wrong with him? Oh, nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:He'll be all right.
OTHERMALE:Come on, Chuck.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:We gotta get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:No, he can't go! Mork, something terrible is happening to me! I've got to go! Now! Now! "E" equals H2O.
LEADFEMALE:No, don't do that! Water equals MC squared.
LEADFEMALE:( all shouting ) I-s-s-ugh! I-s-s-ugh! I-s-s-ugh! Oxygen! Oxygen! Shut up! There's nothin' wrong with him! He's gonna be all right.
SUPMALE:( mysterious theme playing ) All right, come on.
SUPMALE:( panting ) Mork, we'd better hurry.
LEADFEMALE:It's all right, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:No one comes in here till Monday, anyway.
LEADFEMALE:( British accent): I'm sorry, Gwendolyn.
OTHERMALE:Foxholes are for fighting.
LEADMALE:Poor Chuck.
LEADFEMALE:His circuits are really going fast.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's nothing that can't be fixed.
LEADMALE:( angrily ): Get those birds outta here! Easy, old fella.
SUPFEMALE:Easy.
LEADFEMALE:It's gonna be all right.
SUPMALE:Who Who is it? Who's Who's talking to me? It's your old buddy, Mork-O.
LEADMALE:I'm here too, Chuck.
LEADMALE:Remember me? Mindy? You rested your head on my bed, while Mork sponged you off with Rust-Oleum.
LEADFEMALE:I remember.
SUPMALE:( wheezes ) Hey, hang in there, old buddy.
OTHERFEMALE:You're home now.
SUPMALE:Ohh.
SUPMALE:Home.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes.

OTHERMALE:Your hands.
LEADFEMALE:They're warm.
LEADMALE:Reload the muskets! Drive back those zulus, in the name of the queen! Uh why is he shouting? Maybe I can pull his transistors.
LEADFEMALE:That way I can give him a temporary jerry-rig.
SUPMALE:I can recharge him, maybe.
LEADFEMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:Mork, what you want to do is good, but you're only postponing the inevitable.
OTHERFEMALE:But I gotta do something, I don't wanna see him die like this.
LEADFEMALE:But Mork, he's suffering.
OTHERMALE:You're only going to prolong it.
OTHERMALE:I Yeah, but he I think you should let him go for both your sakes.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but it's not right, Mindy.

LEADMALE:" I gave the Tin Man a heart.
SUPMALE:Is that another of your weird analogies? Oh, no, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:Just a movie metaphor.
SUPMALE:See, what actually happened, sir, is there was this robot.
LEADFEMALE:He was nothing but a bunch of nuts and bolts, and I helped him become a person.
LEADFEMALE:You built a monster? No, sir.
SUPMALE:I made a friend.
LEADFEMALE:If you made a friend, why are you so sad? Well, sir, I lost him.
LEADMALE:Can't you make another? No, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I could, but I haven't got the heart for it.
SUPMALE:What do you mean? Well, sir you know when you create someone, and you nurture them, and they grow? Well, there comes a time when they ( voice breaking ): They have to lead their own life, or Or die their own death.

LEADMALE:And what does that mean? Nfcsthwco.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:And what does that mean? Nelson Flavor called and said he would come over.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERMALE:I'm practicing shorthand so I can have an exciting career as a credit neurologist.
LEADMALE:Nelson Flavor's my cousin.
LEADMALE:A what? He's the son of my crazy, rich aunt.
LEADMALE:What's a cousin? Somebody who's related to your parents.
SUPMALE:Oh, you've struck a sore note there, Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm a test-tube baby.
LEADFEMALE:Even I'm not related to my parents.
LEADMALE:Why have I never met this man? Well, he's just so straight.
LEADFEMALE:All right, you want to know what he does for a living? He manufactures attachÃ© cases.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like a brief career.
LEADMALE:Ah, but that's his bag, though.
SUPFEMALE:Arr! He is the kind of guy that you always get the feeling he's trying to sell you something.
LEADMALE:He's always slapping you on the back and shaking your hand.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, combination mugger and masseuse.
LEADMALE:You know, you always have a way of looking at the bright side.
LEADMALE:Well, I have to, Mindy because, you see, today I got fired from my job.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, Mork, not another one.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I sold a whoopee cushion to a deaf man.
LEADMALE:Jeez.
SUPMALE:I only have three music students left.
LEADFEMALE:We're starting to run kind of low on money.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I have another possibility for a job today.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to feed the animals at the zoo.
LEADFEMALE:Especially the baby elephants.
LEADFEMALE:( knock at door ) I'd take them for Chinese.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but probably the MSG will make them a little bit hyper.
LEADFEMALE:Probably will, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:That sounds like something you can handle.
LEADMALE:Maybe I'll get them stoned first and they'll get the munchies.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy McConnell, how you doing? Just fine.
SUPFEMALE:Nelson Flavor, at your service.
LEADMALE:I know, Nelson.
SUPMALE:Gee, I'd give you one of my cards, but I left them in my other dress.

LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Oh, we used to have such F-U-N.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Uh, Nelson, I want you to meet my good friend Mork.
LEADFEMALE:How do you do, Mork? ( buzzing ) Ah! ( chuckles ) Two little kidders.
LEADMALE:Oh! He was working in a novelty shop.
OTHERFEMALE:Lot of fun.
LEADMALE:( chuckles ) Well, Mindy, uh, reason I stopped by is, you're my most favorite cousin.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Hey, wait.
LEADMALE:Honesty time.
LEADMALE:You're my only cousin.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:And I just stopped by to say, "Hey, how you doing?" Well, I'm Well, I'm doing fine.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, since Dad and Grandma sold the music store, I've been teaching music on the side NELSON: Great.
LEADFEMALE:Now, with me there's fantastic news.

LEADFEMALE:Oh, gee, I guess that means I won't be getting an attachÃ© case this Christmas.
LEADMALE:Oh, darn.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes, you will.
OTHERFEMALE:You see, the city-council post is just a part-time job, so I'll be keeping my business.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, I wish you the best of luck, Nelson, but, uh, isn't the election over a year away? Oh, yes, it is.
LEADMALE:I gotta start now if I want my name to become a household word.
LEADMALE:Oh, like "fungus" or "Johnny Mop.
SUPFEMALE:" Sort of.
SUPFEMALE:You see, Mindy, the reason I stopped by is that it There are so many, many women in my district, and I wanted to ask you what they think.
OTHERMALE:About what? Anything.
LEADMALE:Radioactive fallout.
SUPFEMALE:What do women think about radioactive fallout? Uh, they're against it.
LEADFEMALE:( in female voice ): Hell, no, we won't glow! Fascinating.
LEADFEMALE:There's a lot more to this politics business than meets the old eyeball.
OTHERMALE:This city-council post is a steppingstone to the pinnacle, the ultimate.
OTHERMALE:Owning your own gas station.
LEADMALE:Almost.
SUPFEMALE:I want to be the next Vice President of the United States, like my hero, Walter Mondale.
OTHERFEMALE:That's quite an ambition.
SUPMALE:You think I'm aiming too high? Well, that's what I want out of life.
OTHERFEMALE:I've studied everything about Walter.
LEADMALE:You know he lives in Minneapolis? I read that he lives in obscurity.
SUPFEMALE:( chuckling ): Friend of yours.
LEADFEMALE:I want to have everything that Walter has.
SUPMALE:I want the power, I want the glory.
LEADMALE:Everything.
SUPMALE:Well, excuse me.
SUPMALE:I I'm a little confused by one thing.
SUPMALE:Isn't it the purpose of every politician to serve people and help them? Heck of an idea.
SUPMALE:You know, that's crazy, but it's just crazy enough to work.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do it to help people.
OTHERMALE:Hey, listen, Nelson, if you really are interested in the female point of view, why don't you hire me? Yes! You could be my campaign staff.
LEADMALE:How soon can you start? Sooner, if necessary.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Let's go! Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mork, will you call Jeanie and tell her I can't meet her for lunch? Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Tell her I got a job.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:And have a great election.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, it's gone! Mindy! Mindy, Mindy, Mindy! Mindy! What? What? Have you seen my ex? ( loud bang ) Cigar? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Big joke till somebody gets hurt.
LEADFEMALE:You could put a eye out.
LEADFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) Okay, see, fellas, it's like this: You get this broomstick, you put a little tape on the end of it, you hit the ball, and then you run after it.
LEADMALE:See? Kind of like baseball.
LEADMALE:Okay, let me get this straight.
LEADMALE:There is absolutely nothing about this game that will help me grow as a person? I've never heard it described like that.
LEADFEMALE:It's It's stickball.
LEADMALE:You know, it's, uh You play it in the street.
LEADMALE:You run from sewer to sewer, and, uh, you You use a car for first.
SUPMALE:And then you Like, a garbage guy for second.
SUPFEMALE:Some You You ain't a man till you hit three sewers, I'll tell you that.
SUPMALE:It's a heck of a game.
LEADFEMALE:It's, uh, super.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, well, so much for bringing the Bronx to Boulder.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you know what? You should have told them the stick was organic.
LEADMALE:These people are incredible.
LEADFEMALE:They don't even leave me tips.
LEADMALE:Oh, there is one guy, however, who does tip me transcendentally.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:Next time, give him a transcendental burger.
SUPMALE:No buns, no meat.
LEADMALE:( chuckles ) You know, Mork and Mindy are the only normal ones we've met.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, speak of the devil.
SUPFEMALE:( imitating preacher ): The devil! Yea, though he wanders around, he can hide in the kreplach and nail you.
LEADMALE:Come forward now.
LEADFEMALE:You can leave the potato salad.
SUPMALE:Do you know why? Say "pourquoi" if you know why.
LEADMALE:Do you believe? Are you asking? Pourquoi? Butter! Come on home! You believe! Well, at least Mindy's normal.
LEADFEMALE:How you been? Not bad.
OTHERFEMALE:I I got fired from another job.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:Sit down.
LEADMALE:What happened this time? Well, you know, I was supposed to feed the baby elephants, so I gave them peanut butter and their trunks got stuck to the roof of their mouth.
SUPFEMALE:Then one of them sneezed and flew across the zoo.
SUPMALE:But it's all right, though.
LEADFEMALE:I've got an idea for a corporate franchise.
LEADMALE:It'll be called, um, Mork's Ice Palace.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:And my motto will be, "I only have ice for you.
LEADFEMALE:The best you ever thaw.
SUPMALE:" ( laughs ) That's a great idea, but what are you gonna do when summer comes? Stop production.
LEADFEMALE:Don't want to flood the market.
LEADFEMALE:Look, don't be discouraged.
LEADMALE:I must have tried a dozen different things before I found something I really liked.
OTHERFEMALE:What, running a deli? No, lying in the sun.
LEADMALE:Boy, I gotta tell you, Mork, I am really proud of my big brother here.
SUPFEMALE:He gave up all that just to put me through med school.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Wish I had a job so I could be proud of me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on.
SUPMALE:Don't worry about it.
LEADMALE:Hiya, Mork.
SUPMALE:Nice to see you.
LEADFEMALE:How's it going? Mindy said I could find you here.
LEADMALE:Are these your friends? Oh, Nelson Flavor, this is Remo and Jean.
LEADMALE:How do you do, Remo? Jean? Say, are you folks, uh, registered voters? Yeah, we are.
SUPFEMALE:Well, in New York.
LEADFEMALE:Awfully nice talking to you people.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, Mork, I've got a little problem.
OTHERMALE:I wonder if you could help me with it.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's good thinking.
OTHERFEMALE:He'll make it a big problem.
SUPMALE:Remo! I've got too much work.
LEADMALE:Far much more work than Mindy can possibly handle.
SUPFEMALE:I'd like to hire you too.
OTHERMALE:Me? There's no one else here.
LEADMALE:You mean me? Oh, joyous exaltation.
LEADFEMALE:Hallelujah Hallelujah Whoo! Hot dog! Yeow! Woah-ho-ho-ho! I'm okay, now.
LEADMALE:REMO: Hey! Thataway, boy! Play hard to get.
OTHERFEMALE:Mindy said that you were very conscientious, so I'm gonna make you my executive assistant.

LEADMALE:Fantastic.
SUPFEMALE:Welcome aboard.
LEADMALE:Glad to have you on the team.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, N.

LEADFEMALE:( laughing ): I love that joke! JEAN: Mork.
LEADMALE:Good luck.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Morko, don't blow it.
LEADMALE:Hey, uh, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Mork, what are you doing with that money? I always see people forget it, so I'm gonna give it back.
OTHERMALE:Mork, that's my money.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Describe it.
SUPFEMALE:Round and silver.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, is my face red.
LEADMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( Mork singing gibberish ) Yeah! Gonna see What flavors they got Flavors, ha Political innuendo, yeah Hm, yeah! I had no idea political activism could be so stimulating.
SUPFEMALE:Really? I'm kind of bored.
LEADFEMALE:Well, at least we're getting paid.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Eighty bucks a week isn't much.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute! Did you say $80 a week? Mm-hm.
OTHERMALE:He's only paying me 60.
SUPFEMALE:That's because I'm an executive.
LEADMALE:You're an executive? My title is "office girl.
LEADMALE:" Well, you get me a dress and I'll be an office girl.
SUPMALE:Well, how we doing today, team? Ha, ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:How you doing, Mindy? Well, that depends, Nelson.
LEADMALE:Why are you paying him more than me? Oh, he's an executive.
SUPMALE:So, what does that mean? He gets a bigger stapler? No, that means that he does all the important, difficult jobs, so you're free to make coffee.
OTHERMALE:What are you, Nelson? Some kind of a male chauvinist? Well, look, I don't mind making a little coffee, but there's no reason why he shouldn't too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, all right.
SUPFEMALE:I'll go get a pan and fry some up right now.
SUPMALE:I'm I'm sorry, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:I thought making coffee was what women did.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't it genetic? Oh, sure.
LEADFEMALE:I'm getting some negative vibes right now.
OTHERFEMALE:You want me to hire another girl? Why not let the boy do it? ( in Southern accent ): I'll just go in the backyard.
LEADFEMALE:You know, get out of the house This entire subject is academic.
LEADMALE:I have some very important news.
LEADMALE:Are you interested? After close scrutiny of my financial status, I decided that I can only afford to pay one of my assistants.
LEADMALE:MORK: No.
LEADMALE:The first job I was ever able to keep, and I wasn't able to keep it.
SUPMALE:NELSON: Oh, no, I don't want to fire you.
LEADMALE:Your work's been excellent.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you sure can't fire me.
SUPFEMALE:You'd die of thirst.
LEADFEMALE:That's true.
LEADMALE:Therefore, in the true spirit of American competition, I'm gonna let the two of you battle it out to the death.
LEADMALE:I can't.
LEADFEMALE:I I care a lot about Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:And besides, what would I do without me? Uh, no, no, that was a That was a kind of a figure of speech.
LEADMALE:I'm going to observe you for a couple of days, and I'm gonna choose one of you.
LEADMALE:Oh, let her have it, please.
OTHERMALE:She needs a job more than I do.
OTHERMALE:No, no, no, wait a minute, Mork.
LEADMALE:I do want the job, but you can't just give up.
LEADFEMALE:If you want something, you gotta fight for it.
LEADMALE:I don't want to fight you.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but it's not that kind of fighting.
LEADMALE:Competing is healthy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, are you gonna compete? Sure.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I don't want you to compete against yourself, so I'll compete too.
SUPMALE:Good boy! I wish you good luck.
LEADMALE:And may the best man win.
LEADFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) ( yawning ): Oh, yeah! Any coffee? One sec Sure, I have it right here, just the way you like it.
SUPMALE:It's ready and waiting.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I didn't want any with cream.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you don't want it with cream? I have the history of coffee right here.
SUPMALE:We've got your cappuccino.
OTHERFEMALE:We have a little bit of espresso right there.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! We've got your coffee with cream, without cream, with sugar, with lots of sugar for your hypoglycemics, and coffee with no coffee at all.
SUPMALE:Whoop! Listen.
SUPFEMALE:Can you hear inflation? Too late.
LEADFEMALE:Very, very, very impressive.
SUPMALE:Very impressive.
SUPFEMALE:But why do you have one without coffee? Well, it's kind of a Zen coffee.
LEADMALE:It doesn't keep you awake at night and gives you kind of that nirvana buzz.
LEADMALE:( imitates buzzing ) Very efficient.
SUPFEMALE:Very efficient.
LEADMALE:Efficient.
SUPFEMALE:Me, Morko.
LEADMALE:Min.
SUPMALE:Yes? Are you mad? ( chuckles ) Do I look mad? Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Mork Min? I'm mad.
LEADMALE:Why? I thought we'd both try to do the job as best we could.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:You're busy trying to prove you can hold a job, and I'm busy trying to prove that Nelson's a sexist.
LEADFEMALE:Don't all humans have sex? See, there are just some people that believe that men are more capable than women.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:Men and women are equal throughout the universe except on Venus.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah? What's so special about Venus? Dogs rule the planet and the cats have to make the coffee.
SUPFEMALE:The point is, is we're acting ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:Look at us.
LEADMALE:So let's try to handle this situation in a mature, adult manner, okay? I agree.
OTHERMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, can I help you? Well, I hope so.
LEADFEMALE:I sell prosthetic dog ears for Doberman pinschers.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I'll help you better, though.
SUPMALE:Well, I got a problem.
LEADFEMALE:I cater to the curb trade and Oh, well, if you have a problem, I happen to be Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Flavor's personal secretary Well, I'm his personal executive secretary, and I'll kiss and make it better.
SUPFEMALE:No lie.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckling ): Yes.
SUPMALE:Don't mind him.
SUPFEMALE:He's really not a well man.
LEADFEMALE:I, on the other hand, am a very capable woman who is privy to even the most top-secret aspects of Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Flavor's campaign.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, but I'm his campaign manager.
OTHERFEMALE:Say, it with me, now: Nelson Flavor! You know it.
SUPFEMALE:BOTH: Nelson Flavor.
LEADMALE:You're a fan of it.
LEADMALE:It's vanilla.
SUPMALE:We're talking all-American, melting in the hot sun ( screams ) moist, with a cherry on top! Uh, sir? Uh Uh, I wish you'd come out of there.
SUPFEMALE:We're We're really trying to help you.
LEADMALE:Something going on here? No.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Just trying to hold the wall up.
SUPFEMALE:Hold the wall up.
LEADFEMALE:Foundation's weak.
SUPMALE:What was that? Big rat.
LEADMALE:Who's in there? Pinocchio.
LEADFEMALE:Are you Flavor? Uh, yes, I am.
OTHERFEMALE:I got a problem, Flavor.
LEADMALE:I'll I'll I'll help you with your problem but first you'll have to come out of the closet.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I don't think that's his problem.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Tell the goons to take a walk first.
LEADMALE:Is that all? No.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm in canine prostheses.
LEADMALE:Mm-hm.
SUPFEMALE:The city's tearing up the pavement in front of my store.
LEADFEMALE:I thought maybe you could stop it.
OTHERFEMALE:No problem.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take care of it personally just as soon as I'm elected.
SUPFEMALE:You have Nelson Flavor personally to thank.
LEADMALE:Here, have a hat.
OTHERFEMALE:Take this brochure.
SUPFEMALE:Read up all about me.
LEADMALE:Don't thank me.
LEADFEMALE:Thank the friends who gave us all those contributions.
LEADMALE:Word of advice, Flavor, with these two around, I wouldn't run for office.
SUPFEMALE:I'd run for cover.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Nelson, don't you think there's probably a good reason why the city is tearing up that man's sidewalk? There is? This is probably a more complex issue than I thought.
LEADFEMALE:Uh Uh, Mork, give me a full report on this subject.
OTHERMALE:Right away.
LEADFEMALE:All right, how is this one? How about this for a byline: "Sidewalks aren't all they're cracked up to be.
SUPMALE:Need concrete solution"? Fantastic! Ha-ha! I love the way this boy thinks! Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:What a mind.
SUPMALE:Did you hear that? Nelson, shouldn't I write that report? I mean, after all, I was hired first.
LEADMALE:I have seniority.
LEADMALE:Oh, so now you're pretending to be a Mexican? Look, Nelson, if you want to get elected, you're gonna have to pay attention to the women's vote.
SUPMALE:Now, what about Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Hodges? She's the head of the Women's Political League in Boulder.
OTHERFEMALE:She's a very important person.
LEADMALE:Yes, that's true, and she's a woman too.
LEADFEMALE:And my landlady, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Burns.
OTHERMALE:She's a woman too.
LEADFEMALE:They're everywhere.
LEADFEMALE:I can help you with all of them.
SUPFEMALE:Hm.
LEADMALE:This is becoming harder and harder by every You got the political savvy, and you've got all the contacts.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, prepare a report on who you think I should hire for this.
OTHERMALE:Get me in triplicate.
OTHERMALE:Give me the original, you keep a copy, and, uh, throw a copy away.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute! Mork! Come on Nelson! Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I tell you what.
LEADMALE:I'll make my decision this evening.
LEADFEMALE:You two take the night off on me.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh, I'll see one of you later.
SUPMALE:( laughs ): Get it? Well, Mindy, maybe you're right.
LEADMALE:We should be mature about this.
SUPMALE:Deal with it as adults.
SUPFEMALE:I'll tell you what.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll race you home.
LEADFEMALE:You forget, I have wheels.
LEADMALE:Ah-ha! But I've got more of them! ( upbeat them playing ) ( chuckles ) ( thump ) Are you still mad at me? Oh, Mork, do I look mad? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You're catching on.
LEADMALE:Min, what's wrong? We used to have so much fun.
SUPMALE:I know, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:It's all because of this dumb job.
LEADMALE:Well, you take the dumb job.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Listen, tell you what.
SUPMALE:Tomorrow morning, we'll both go down there and we'll both tell him that if he can't find the money to To pay us both, then we'll both quit.
SUPFEMALE:It's a deal? It's a deal.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:On Ork we call it a partnership or a group corporation.
LEADMALE:Really? Same thing on Earth.
LEADMALE:Small world, aren't it? ( knock at door ) I'll get it.
OTHERMALE:Uh! ( clears throat ): Excuse me.
SUPMALE:I wonder who that is.
OTHERFEMALE:Sounds to me like someone with knuckles.
SUPFEMALE:Hiya, Mindy! Hi, Nelson.
SUPMALE:What are you doing here? Well, I was out politicking in the neighborhood and, uh, thought I'd come by.
SUPFEMALE:I've, uh, made my decision.
OTHERMALE:Well, we've made a decision too, Nelson.
OTHERFEMALE:We've decided that no job is worth what you've been putting us through.
LEADFEMALE:And Mork and I care for each other very much, but having to compete like this is making us act like different people.
LEADFEMALE:And we don't like those kind of people.
LEADFEMALE:So you either hire the both of us or we both quit.
OTHERFEMALE:I accept your resignation.
OTHERMALE:Listen, none of your political jargon, now.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want any Nixonisms.
LEADMALE:I want the truth.
LEADMALE:Honest answers.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, now, clown prince.
LEADFEMALE:How about it? Whoo! Right here.
LEADFEMALE:I'm ready for it.
LEADMALE:Let me have it.
LEADFEMALE:That was an answer.
LEADFEMALE:We're out.
LEADFEMALE:We are? I'm terribly sorry, but I realized I have a moral obligation to hire a minority.
LEADMALE:I'd like you to meet her.
LEADFEMALE:Suzy! Oh, here, let me carry those for you.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:She's a minority? Uh, Swedish.
OTHERFEMALE:That should help you with the bleached vote.
LEADFEMALE:Just one more thing, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm speaking to a women's rights rally tomorrow and I wanted to know what's a good subject to speak about? How about, um, looking nice for Mr.
SUPMALE:Right? I think they'll really respond to that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'll see you guys later.
LEADMALE:Us blonds are gonna go have more fun.
OTHERMALE:( laughs ) Rod Stewart.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, we We go see Rod Stewart? No, we're not going to see Rod Stewart! Well.
LEADMALE:Well, I've lost another job, haven't I? Oh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, look at it this way: You You've already got a job observing Earth, right? Right.
LEADMALE:And you're doing pretty well at that, right? Well, I I guess you're right.
SUPFEMALE:Well, so, what does it matter that you're having a little trouble finding the right Earth job? Well, doesn't matter.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:So at least we're friends again.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Why not? We haven't sealed our partnership.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:All right, well, on Earth, we do that by shaking hands.
LEADFEMALE:On Ork, we do it by trading clothes.
LEADMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) MORK: Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:ORSON: So, Mork, did you finally get that job you've been talking about? Oh, not exactly, your bloatness.
LEADMALE:It seems here that on Earth, everyone finds a need to compete with each other.
SUPMALE:They compete in sports, in work, in everything.
SUPMALE:What do they get if they win? Something called an ulcer, sir.
LEADMALE:I don't know what it is, but it must be wonderful because everyone who's successful gets one.
LEADFEMALE:I guess it'll be a while before you put an ulcer on your mantelpiece.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, noshu, chiefsmoke.
LEADFEMALE:Although Mindy and I did have a competition.
SUPMALE:Oh? Who won? We both did, sir.
LEADMALE:We decided to stick together.
LEADMALE:That's very good, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You're learning about cooperation and maturity.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, your preachiness.
SUPFEMALE:I've learned that even though you win that ulcer, it's no fun if you've lost the one that you wanted to share it with.
LEADMALE:Till next week, nanu, nanu.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu.
SUPMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Mindy.

LEADMALE:And, uh Oh, my, yes.
LEADMALE:Other things, huh? Headphones.
LEADMALE:Ah! Gee, Mork, uh, why'd you buy me these things? I heard you say you were having an affair and you didn't have anything to wear.
LEADFEMALE:So I met this wonderful cabdriver named Aloo and he took me shopping.
SUPMALE:Uh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:See, I'm having a political affair tomorrow.
OTHERMALE:Uh, these things really aren't quite appropriate.
SUPFEMALE:Are you kidding? Lumpy said his best customers are politicians.
LEADFEMALE:He even sold a pair of tight shoes to Earl Butz.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you don't understand.
OTHERMALE:It's a It's a different kind of affair.
LEADMALE:It's for Nelson, my cousin, remember? He's running for city council.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I'd have a little reception so he could meet some local business leaders.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I've never been to a political affair before.
LEADFEMALE:Neither have I.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I'm having such a hard time making all the arrangements.
LEADMALE:Can I help you maybe? Can I help, huh? Je t'assiste? Ha-ha! Gee, Mork, I'm sorry, but I don't know how you could help.
LEADFEMALE:I helped before.
LEADMALE:Remember that surprise party for Remo when I invited everyone? Except Remo.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Boy, is he gonna be surprised when he finds out.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Since it's a political affair, maybe I could possibly plan the menu.
LEADMALE:Since they're politicians, we could have ham stuffed with bologna.
SUPMALE:And then have junkets for everybody.
LEADMALE:Oh, I guess I'm not being very helpful, am I? Oh, Mork, well, you At least you always give it a good shot.
LEADFEMALE:And I'll tell you, I don't know what I'd do without you.
LEADFEMALE:Me neither.
OTHERMALE:( Laughs ) You know, you really are about the best friend I have in the whole world.
LEADFEMALE:You are.
LEADMALE:( Laughs ) So what's so funny about that? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:( Laughs ) Then why are you laughing? I'm not laughing, I I'm sneezing.
LEADMALE:That's what happens when I have a cold.
OTHERMALE:Remember when I had a cold and I took a pill and it made me real small? Oh, yeah, you laughed then too.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but I don't have a cold now.
LEADFEMALE:I must be having an allergic reaction to something.
LEADFEMALE:Huh.
LEADMALE:Well, whenever we have an allergic reaction, we sneeze, like, you know, like "Ah-choo!" Well, that's what happens when we eat burritos.
LEADMALE:I must be allergic to something in the room then.
LEADFEMALE:( doorbell rings ) Huh.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe there's something funny in the air.
LEADFEMALE:Hopefully.
LEADMALE:Hello, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi, Nelson.
SUPMALE:Nice to see you.
SUPMALE:There's my main man.

LEADFEMALE:( Italian accent): Nanu, nanu.
LEADMALE:Great people, Italians.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, so, uh, Nelson, what brings you by? Well, if I wanna fulfill my dream of becoming Walter Mondale, I've gotta run a good race.
LEADFEMALE:So I've been out in the neighborhood, uh, looking for support.
SUPFEMALE:People should never run without their supporters.
LEADFEMALE:I want the common man to know the real Nelson Flavor.
LEADFEMALE:I want the common man to know that Nelson Flavor cares.
SUPMALE:( laughs ) Did I say something humorous? No.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Sorry.

LEADFEMALE:Heh-heh! No, no, uh, see, Mork's laughing because Mork's happy and And he's happy because you're running for city council.
OTHERFEMALE:Aren't you, Mork? No.

SUPMALE:Now, I'll be seeing you tomorrow night and I hope I won't be seeing Mr.
LEADMALE:Hyena-puss.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
SUPMALE:This could be terrible.
SUPFEMALE:We've gotta do something about those allergies or it'll be embarrassing.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you know something, Mindy? I just realized something.
SUPFEMALE:( laughs ) The closer I get to you, the more I sneeze.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:See? Ha! Whoa.

LEADMALE:Oh ( melancholy theme playing ) Hey, Mork.
SUPMALE:Something wrong? I have an allergy.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe you should go get some allergy shots.
LEADFEMALE:What are those? Well, a doctor injects small amounts of whatever you're allergic to into your arm, and then gradually he increases the dose.
SUPFEMALE:Where I'm from, we have a little man that drills inside your nose with sandpaper and a hose.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ) You know what? I bet that you'll find that allergy shots work much better.
LEADMALE:You mean I can be cured? Well, there's a real good chance.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, doctor, mmmmm.
SUPFEMALE:You're welcome.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey.

LEADMALE:Then the doctor cured him, right? They were forced to split up.
LEADFEMALE:They never saw each other again.
SUPMALE:EXIDOR: Step aside.
SUPFEMALE:Don't push.
OTHERFEMALE:There's plenty of food in here for everybody.

LEADMALE:Things'll be just like they were before I was sick.
OTHERMALE:( laughs ) Yeah hmmm.
LEADFEMALE:You sound like a phone call I had last night.
LEADMALE:Listen, Mork, nobody wants you to live here more than I do, but you just can't spend your life in a scuba outfit.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, I can, if I only talk for three seconds.
LEADMALE:That's ridiculous.
LEADMALE:We gotta find another way.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Well, I could always hold my breath.
LEADMALE:Oh, now, that's ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Mork, come on.

SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Min ( laughs ) Mindy, I've gotta get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:It's too late.
LEADMALE:But where are you gonna go? Well, maybe I can go stay with Exidor.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Well, I guess that's the only thing to do until we find out how to fix things.
LEADMALE:Oh, boy, am I gonna miss you.
LEADMALE:( laughs ) ( laughing ): I'm gonna miss you too.
OTHERMALE:Well? Oh, here.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha-ha! Here.

SUPMALE:What are you doing here? Well, you said I could come visit you.
OTHERMALE:Yes, I said that, but, uh, now is, uh Well, it's not a good time if you know what I mean.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you've got water in your ear, huh? I'm not alone.
LEADMALE:I'm with a W-O-M-A-N.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:There's more to life than just preaching, you know.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh-ho-ho! Why don't you go home to your fox? I can't live with Mindy.
SUPMALE:She threw you out? I'll put a hex on her in the morning, as soon as they deliver the dead coyotes.
OTHERFEMALE:Tonight you stay here.
LEADMALE:Well, what about Touch her and you'll suck seaweed.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, my friend.
SUPMALE:Oh, this is wonderful.
LEADMALE:Sears meets Rococo.
SUPMALE:Mork, this is heaven.
SUPFEMALE:And I owe my salvation to Gretchen.
LEADFEMALE:Say hello to Mork, de Would you go put on some clothes? Naughty, naughty, naughty.
SUPFEMALE:I love 'em zaftig.
OTHERFEMALE:Now you can see why I'm such a changed man, Mork.
LEADMALE:It sure beats living alone, huh? Yes.
OTHERMALE:Sit down.
SUPMALE:Make yourself at home.
SUPFEMALE:Care for some iguana jerky? No, the little tiny claws get caught between my teeth.
SUPFEMALE:You know, before I met Gretchen, it was all work, work, work.
SUPFEMALE:But no more.
LEADMALE:Sit right here, Angel Breath.
SUPMALE:I'm so happy you wore the pink.
LEADFEMALE:It's very nice.
SUPMALE:I saw what you were staring at.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's all right, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:I understand, you're lonesome.
OTHERMALE:I was lonesome too until Gretchie asked me to move in with her.
LEADFEMALE:This is her place.
SUPFEMALE:How she can afford it, I'll never know.
OTHERFEMALE:But when you got a good thing going, don't ask a lot of questions.
LEADMALE:Well, Mindy and I had a good thing going, but because of my allergy, no more.
LEADFEMALE:Allergy? Well, I Every time I get near her, I start laughing.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, relax.
SUPMALE:It may be nothing more than mental illness.
OTHERFEMALE:Well I'd give anything to be normal again.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I can help you.
SUPMALE:I developed a revolutionary allergy treatment years ago when I was a doctor.
LEADMALE:This may be too tough for you, darling.
SUPFEMALE:I injected the hair of a yak in the arm of an orangutan.
LEADMALE:Did the cure work? Do you ever hear any sneezing in jungle movies? Well, do you think maybe if I put some of Mindy's hair and inject it in my arm, it'll cure me? ( laughs ) Stop, stop that tickling, now.
LEADFEMALE:We can't do that now.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha! It's getting a little late, isn't it? Late? It's only7:00.
LEADMALE:Well, that is late.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, we'll get back to your problem in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:Come along, Gretchen darling.
LEADMALE:If you need me, I'll be in there.
LEADMALE:Oh, excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:Where do I sleep? Why, on the couch, of course with Lola.
LEADMALE:Lola? Gretchen's twin sister.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, they They do look a lot alike.
OTHERMALE:( both chuckle ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's so good to see you again.
SUPFEMALE:( muffled speech ) Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, it just hasn't been the same without you around here.
SUPMALE:( muffled speech ) Oh, Mork, if only we could be close again.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, ha-ha! I can't hear a word you're saying with that gag on your mouth.
LEADMALE:( Grunts ) Oh, boy.
LEADFEMALE:( nasal voice ): Well, I think I finally found a cure.
SUPFEMALE:I think it might work, Mindy.
SUPMALE:Really? I'll try anything.
SUPFEMALE:Anything.
SUPMALE:Well What is it? Well ( muffled ) I have to get a Mindy injection.
OTHERFEMALE:You're gonna what? I have to get a Mindy injection.
LEADMALE:Boy, that That sounds weird.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it's worth a try.
LEADMALE:What I have to do is take a couple of hairs out of your head and inject them into my arm.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I don't know, Mork It's worth a shot.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'll find some scissors.
SUPMALE:Ow! Those aren't potato chips, buddy.
LEADMALE:You can just take one.
LEADMALE:Gee.
SUPMALE:I have to take a massive dose so there's no problem.
SUPFEMALE:Eeeeeeeee! ( doorbell rings ) Oh, no, my guests are here.
LEADFEMALE:Will you wait? ( Laughs ) Mork, will you wait in the bedroom until you're cured? Shhh.
SUPMALE:Please, please, please.
SUPMALE:( doorbell ringing ) Just wait in here.
LEADFEMALE:You're not as cute with that little bald spot up there, you know.
LEADFEMALE:( Mork laughs, doorbell rings ) ( chattering ) Great party, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:All of Boulder's biggies are here.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, everybody seems to be having a good time, don't they? Party hearty.
SUPMALE:( both chuckle ) Mindy, when I get elected, you'll have the satisfaction of knowing me when I was your cousin.
LEADMALE:Well, you can count on my vote, Flavor.
LEADFEMALE:It's refreshing to meet someone who has such compassion for the rich.
SUPMALE:I look at it this way.
LEADFEMALE:Who are the rich, but poor people with yachts? Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Before I run off, uh, can I get you anything? Impossible.
LEADMALE:I have everything.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Nelson, you really amaze me.
SUPMALE:You really know how to say what people wanna hear.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, there's two sides to every issue.
SUPFEMALE:And I always agree with both.
LEADFEMALE:( falsetto ): Coochie-coochie-coochie, Mr.
LEADMALE:Prendergast.
SUPMALE:Ha-ha-ha! Hello, hello.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mr.
OTHERMALE:O'Keefe, what a lovely tie.
LEADFEMALE:I guess they couldn't guess your weight, eh? Rabbi, is it true that Sammy Davis eats kosher chicken wings? Ha-ha! I feel like such a "mishugette.
LEADMALE:" Look, a Frisbee.
SUPFEMALE:Wham-o! Oh-ho-ho! May I take your hat? Sears had a sale, how wonderful.
LEADMALE:Oh, missy.
SUPMALE:Oh, what a lovely map of Utah.
LEADMALE:Oh! Oh, those are veins.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Oh, welcome.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Hey, hi.
LEADMALE:He must have taken an overdose of me.
SUPMALE:Who's she? Uh, you don't wanna know.
SUPFEMALE:Another Wang, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Egg Roll? Excuse me, can I speak to you for a moment? Oh, sure.
LEADMALE:Ta-ta.
SUPMALE:Mork, what are you doing? I'm not Mork, I'm Mindy.
OTHERMALE:I'm Mindy.
LEADMALE:( Clucking ) Mork Mork.
LEADMALE:Mork.
SUPMALE:Mindy.
LEADMALE:Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
SUPMALE:Now, you listen Nelson, I think we have a party crasher who's drunk.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you throw her out and I'll go powder my nose? Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, when does this wear off? Let go.
LEADMALE:You're hurting me.
OTHERFEMALE:PRENDERGAST: Who are you? I'm Mindy, Nelson's cousin, but let's not talk about that.
LEADMALE:Let's dance till we don't know who we are.
LEADFEMALE:Come.
OTHERFEMALE:( sings melody ) I think it's time to leave.
LEADMALE:( disappointed chattering ) Nelson, our guests are leaving us.
LEADFEMALE:Say goodbye.
LEADMALE:Ciao.
LEADFEMALE:Arrivederci.
LEADMALE:La-la-la.
LEADMALE:Take care.
LEADFEMALE:Whoops, and a gift for you.
LEADMALE:Oops! Something to remember us by.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! Oh, what a night.
OTHERFEMALE:Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night.
OTHERMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) I took off all of your clothes.
SUPMALE:Ha-ha-ha! There's still something I need unhooked if you get the chance.
SUPFEMALE:I've got some good news for you.
SUPMALE:The Mindy injection wore off and I'm almost back to abnormal.
LEADMALE:( chuckles ) Yeah.
LEADMALE:You're still mad, aren't you? Well, Mork, I'm not mad because you blew my party and I'm not mad because Nelson cried on my shoulder till my dress shrank.
LEADFEMALE:But what I am upset about is that you just can't be you.
SUPFEMALE:Ha! Well, no, I I've tried everything and nothing works.
SUPMALE:I've been thinking, you didn't get sick until after I held you close and told you how much you meant to me.
SUPMALE:So? So I think maybe you're not allergic to me at all.
LEADFEMALE:I think maybe you're just afraid of getting too close to someone.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, I I think now you're being real silly.
OTHERMALE:No, really.
SUPMALE:( Laughs ) You're being kind of silly there.
SUPMALE:No, I think it scares you.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:After all, it still It still is a new emotion.
LEADFEMALE:Come here.
SUPMALE:What're you gonna do? I'm gonna help you take the worry out of being close.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Ha! Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:You keep away from me, boy.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-uh.
OTHERFEMALE:Nuh-uh.
LEADFEMALE:There's nothing in the air that you're allergic to.
LEADMALE:That's why none of those things worked.
LEADFEMALE:You tried air hoses, nose plugs, allergy shots.
OTHERMALE:And now you're gonna try a little of me.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha! No, no.
LEADFEMALE:( southern accent ): I'm gonna hug you till your eyes pop out.
LEADFEMALE:No way! ( laughing uncontrollably ) ( normal voice ): It's all right.
LEADMALE:( laughter subsiding ) There.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Ohhh.
LEADFEMALE:You stopped laughing.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I think your allergy is cured.
LEADFEMALE:Sure beats the heck out of going to a doctor, huh? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks, you You helped me be more human.
LEADMALE:Well, what's an earthling for, after all, right? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You know what? What? Your underwear is kinda comfortable.
SUPFEMALE:Let me show you ( upbeat theme playing ) ( mystical theme playing ) MORK: Mork calling Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:( imitates zooming, imitates buzzing ) ORSON: What did you learn this week? Oh, beaucoup de choses, Your Lordship.
LEADMALE:But mainly I learned a lot about politics.
LEADFEMALE:What's politics? It's the art of fooling most of the people most of the time, as often as possible.
LEADMALE:Politics sounds very strange.
LEADMALE:Oh, it is, sir.
LEADMALE:A politician will do anything to get in office.
SUPFEMALE:He'll kiss babies, mules.
LEADMALE:When he finally gets into office and you call him, they say, "He's not in the office at this time.
LEADMALE:Beep!" Don't Earthlings have any leaders they admire? Oh, yes, sir, they do.
LEADMALE:But they're all dead.
LEADFEMALE:The most famous is one called George Washington.
SUPMALE:He's the one that's on the dollar bill that's only worth 45 cents.
SUPMALE:What did he do? Well, he slept here, he slept here, he slept there.
OTHERMALE:I guess that's why most politicians honor him by doing the same thing.
LEADMALE:It looks like you've learned a lot, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, more than you know, sir.
LEADMALE:( chuckles ) I even learned that an allergy is nothing to sneeze at.
LEADFEMALE:Argh! You mean you were sick? Well, sir, I wouldn't call it that, but I I did develop an extreme reaction to being too close to Mindy.
LEADMALE:You're playing with fire, Mork.
SUPMALE:I know, sir.
LEADMALE:According to the Orkan General, closeness is the leading cause of disease.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sir, I I used to believe that old voodoo.
LEADFEMALE:But if closeness is so wrong, why are we born with arms, huh? Isn't that kind of Zen-like? Think about that till next week, sir.
LEADFEMALE:It'll probably take you an hour or so.
OTHERFEMALE:Catch you later.
LEADMALE:Until then ( chanting ): Ommm, ommm on the range.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Nanu, nanu! ( upbeat theme playing ) ( mellow theme playing ) So, this is where you grew up? Yep, I was born and raised in this house.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I could tell from its cute little pug chimney.
OTHERMALE:You're really interested in buying it, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley? Maybe yes, maybe no.
LEADMALE:Why is your old man trying to dump it? My father is trying to sell it, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley.
OTHERMALE:Hm.
LEADFEMALE:With he and Grandma on the road all year with the orchestra, it's just standing here empty.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds solid.
SUPMALE:Yep.
SUPFEMALE:Does this place have indoor plumbing? Of course this place has indoor plumbing.
LEADMALE:A smart buyer learns to ask the tough questions.
SUPFEMALE:It's a terrific house.
SUPFEMALE:Just look at it.
SUPMALE:We're even fixing it up a little bit.
LEADMALE:That wallpaper looks new.
LEADFEMALE:Is it? It is.
LEADMALE:Mm-hm.
SUPFEMALE:Mork just put it up this morning.
OTHERMALE:Didn't know the boy was handy.
SUPMALE:You know, it's funny.
SUPMALE:Somehow, this room looks different to me.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, are you here? Here I am.
LEADFEMALE:Why did you wallpaper the door? Well, I didn't want to stop.
LEADFEMALE:I was on a roll.
SUPMALE:MORK: What do you think, Bick? It's worthy of a photo layout in House Bazaar.
SUPMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley, I promise, by the time we're done, this house'll be as good as new, and you'll be able to enjoy it, just as much as my family did.
SUPMALE:Bick, what do you want a house for? I yearn for digs to call my own.
LEADMALE:Let's be honest.
OTHERMALE:An apartment is for wild young people.
SUPFEMALE:But a house, on the other hand For wild old people.
LEADMALE:La, la-la Miss McConnell, I just might be interested in this place.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Mindy, that's wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:One day on the market, already we've got a sucker.
LEADMALE:I guess that makes you the suckee, huh? Whoa, ho, ho! We'll see about that.
LEADMALE:How old is this house, anyway? Well, it's been in my family for about 80 years.
LEADFEMALE:But it's been renovated a couple of times.
LEADMALE:Eighty years, huh? I would imagine the original owner must have paid, oh, $2,000 or $3,000 for it.
SUPMALE:Huh, yeah, probably.
LEADMALE:Tell you what.
OTHERFEMALE:Because I know you, I might even double that.
LEADMALE:Look, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley, this house means a lot to me.
SUPMALE:I was born here, and my mother died here.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not even that sure I want to sell it.
OTHERFEMALE:I think I should see the other rooms, before we dicker over moola.
LEADMALE:Listen, why don't you come back tomorrow, uh, when everything's more together, fixed up? All right, I'll meet you here tomorrow night at 7.
LEADMALE:Call it impulse, call it serendipity, but I have a strong Nay, overpowering affinity for this joint.
LEADMALE:That's great.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I have to get home, too.
SUPFEMALE:I'm making dinner for Jeanie tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you stay here and clean up.
SUPFEMALE:Well, all right! I'll stay here and clean up, you go home and make dinner! She likes it when I talk rough to her.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:( mellow theme playing ) Mindy, if it bothers you that much to sell the house, why don't you take it off the market? But my dad wants to sell it.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I understand why, but, it's just It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
LEADMALE:I think the hardest thing I ever had to do was to refuse a complete physical exam from the chief resident at the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:It was in his Corvette.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ) I'm still picking fiberglass out of my clothes.
LEADMALE:Oh, Jeanie, why am I feeling like this? I mean, it's just a house.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it was your home, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:There is a big difference between a house and a home.
SUPMALE:Yeah, a house is bricks and wood siding, and a home is memories.
LEADMALE:Yeah, where you lick cookies off a mixer blade.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You did that too? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I always had to keep my eye on Remo, so he wouldn't turn the mixer on.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ) There are a lot of memories in my house.
LEADFEMALE:I'm getting a little sentimental here, right? After all, what is this? It's a business deal.
OTHERMALE:We're out to unload some real estate.
OTHERMALE:But I am putting in the deal, that no one is allowed to sleep in my bedroom.
OTHERMALE:( laughs ) Mork! Mork, what is it? ( yelling shrilly ) I think something's troubling him.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, will you come out? Mork ( screams ) Mork, will you come out, and tell me what What's the matter? Oh, nothing much.
SUPFEMALE:Just your house tried to attack me, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Mork, now, really.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you mean, "Come on, really," Mindy? Mindy, I'm telling you the truth.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I was at the house, and all of a sudden, I was hanging wallpaper, and the wind blew me across the room Shhh! Then it got real cold.
LEADFEMALE:Then it got real hot.
LEADFEMALE:And then a swarm of bees came in.
LEADFEMALE:( buzzes ) Then a swarm of flies.
LEADFEMALE:Zip, a-zip, zip, zip, zip zip, zip, zip! And then I ran flamboyantly, screaming to the window.
LEADFEMALE:Ahh, ahh, ahhhh! And it slammed shut! Then this is the terrifying part.
LEADFEMALE:I was standing there, and the furniture started attacking me! Yes! A little ottoman, and a little ottowoman too.
SUPFEMALE:They were coming at me.
SUPFEMALE:And the armchair couldn't keep its hands to itself.
LEADMALE:( shrill voice ) This is the really bad part.
OTHERFEMALE:A strange voice came crying out "Get out of here!" By the time it said "here," I was here.
LEADFEMALE:Have you been hitting the cream soda again? No, Mindy, Mindy, you gotta believe me.
OTHERMALE:You gotta believe me.
LEADFEMALE:Believe you? What am I supposed to believe, that my house is haunted? Oh, either that, or I've lost my mind.
LEADMALE:( laughs maniacally ) Maybe you better call the police and ask them to look for a little gray, squishy thing.
SUPMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:Look, he could be right.
SUPFEMALE:You know, there are case histories of haunted houses.
LEADFEMALE:It's a normal house.
SUPFEMALE:I lived there for 20 years.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, tomorrow I'm going to take you over to the house in the light of day, and you can see for yourself that all those things are just a product of your overactive imagination.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I have just one thing to say to that, Mindy.
LEADMALE:What? ( Moans ) Oh! MINDY: Look, everything is fine.
OTHERMALE:See? There's nothing to worry about.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, will you come in here, please? Evil spirit, begone! In the name of Joe Garagiola, Bowie Kuhn and Dick Butkus, begone! Mork, you are perfectly safe.
LEADFEMALE:There's nothing to worry about.
LEADMALE:And don't you feel a little ridiculous in that getup? Maybe I was gonna wear it anyway, huh? Now, I want you to take a look around.
SUPFEMALE:Do you see any flies? Do you see any bees? No, but they were here last night.
LEADFEMALE:Well, bugs get in sometimes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, big suckers like that.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hm.
SUPFEMALE:How does that explain the furniture's moving? The bees were underneath buzzing? Sometimes a truck goes by, and it moves things.
LEADFEMALE:You sure? I'm positive.
LEADMALE:"How the mind can wreak havoc on one's sensibilities, thereby dulling judgment.
SUPFEMALE:" Timothy Leary, 1978.
LEADMALE:I mean, look at this place.
OTHERMALE:Everything is fine.
LEADFEMALE:And even with the furniture covered like this, it still has a certain warmth.
SUPMALE:See this chair? My mother did the needlepoint on this entire chair.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that's beautiful.
LEADMALE:Did she crochet this stain too? And see these marks on the door? That was how tall I was, each birthday, from age 2 to 13.
LEADMALE:We have the same thing on Ork, except they tattoo it on the back of our head.
SUPMALE:No wonder I'm having such a hard time selling this place.
OTHERFEMALE:There's a little bit of me and my family in every room.
SUPFEMALE:Anyone would be lucky to own a house like that.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's so nice.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE:( ghostly voice ) Get out of here.
SUPFEMALE:Did you hear that? Hope it was a truck.
SUPFEMALE:Get out of heeere! Mindy, I always believe, that you must follow the advice of the spirit world.
LEADMALE:Let's take a hike! Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:It sounds like it's coming from that closet.
LEADFEMALE:That's wonderful.
LEADMALE:Let's talk about that over tea in Wyoming.
SUPMALE:No! I'm not leaving.
OTHERMALE:This is my house.
LEADMALE:Well, good luck, aim high.
SUPMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:Get ooout of here.
LEADFEMALE:Count to three and open the door.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:1, 2, 3.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:( wailing shrilly ) Ahhh.
SUPFEMALE:Hee, hee.
OTHERMALE:Ow W W One.
LEADMALE:Tw Tw Tw Twooo.
OTHERMALE:T T T Three! ( gasps ) You didn't get out of here.
SUPFEMALE:That's not nice.
SUPFEMALE:Exidor.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing here? Vacationing.
SUPFEMALE:But this is my house.
LEADMALE:Of course.
LEADMALE:You can't vacation in your own house.
OTHERFEMALE:Be kind, she's riding on empty.
LEADMALE:( blows whistle ) Out of the water! Don't you see that fin? I hate to burst your very tiny bubble, but this is not a resort.
LEADFEMALE:It's a private home, and that is a closet.
LEADFEMALE:A closet? Mm-hmm.
SUPFEMALE:The vacation is over, Exidor.
LEADMALE:Over? Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:But I thought checkout time wasn't until 12:00.
OTHERFEMALE:Out.
LEADFEMALE:Out? Moi? Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:All right, boys, let's go! This place is getting too commercial.
LEADFEMALE:Steinmatz! I don't care if it's not Labor Day, your summer's over! Well, I told you there would be an explanation for all those strange things that were happening.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you know something, Mindy? Sometimes you're wise beyond your dimples.
LEADMALE:( laughs ) Thanks.
SUPMALE:Let's take a look around, and see if there's anything else we should do before the house is sold.
SUPFEMALE:Better do it quickly.
LEADFEMALE:It's getting kinda chilly in here.
SUPMALE:It is.
SUPMALE:( ominous theme playing ) ( wind blowing ) ( gasps ) ( shrill laughter ) MORK: Let's get out of here! ( high-pitched laughter ) ( upbeat theme playing ) ( squeaking ) I just don't understand it.
LEADMALE:I mean, there's gotta be a logical explanation for what we saw.
SUPMALE:Oh, there is.
LEADMALE:Your house is haunted.
LEADMALE:( laughs nervously ) You know, if I were you, I wouldn't talk about this to anybody, 'cause you could find yourself wearing a cute, white blazer with the sleeves that tie in the back.
LEADFEMALE:Remo, I'm not imagining things.
OTHERMALE:We saw it, didn't we, Mork? Mork? ( screams ): Yes! Yes, it's horrid! Oh! Oh, there were ghosts in there.
LEADMALE:Hundreds of 'em! ( sobbing ) Will you? Will you get up, please? Do you realize? Do you realize you're acting with less than total dignity? Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I want you to be cool.
LEADMALE:Like Jack Nicholson.
SUPMALE:( as Jack Nicholson ) Damn straight.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:You gotta be fearless, like Charles Bronson.
SUPFEMALE:( as Charles Bronson ) Kill the women and children first.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's a boy! ( Jean clears throat ) Well, if you ask me, you've disturbed the spirit world.
SUPMALE:Disturbed the spirit world? How? Mindy, you're selling a house that's been in your family a very long time.
LEADFEMALE:What a bag of Bandini! ( as Rod Serling ) There are things in the cosmos that must go unexplained.
SUPMALE:Mindy, I don't want to upset you, but after Mork told us what went on in your house, well, I did a little research, and I found this old book in the library.
LEADFEMALE:"Colorado Legends.
LEADMALE:" ( normal voice ) Oh, intriguing.
LEADMALE:Hoo, hoo! That's just bunk! ( clears throat ) You recognize this? Yeah, that looks like my house.
LEADFEMALE:It is, in 1921.
SUPFEMALE:But it was known then as La Follette House.
LEADFEMALE:La Follette is my mother's maiden name.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this book says that two sisters built this home in 1894, Lucinda and Deirdre La Follette.
LEADMALE:Lucinda and Deirdre? They must have been my great-great-aunts or something.
LEADMALE:Well, according to this, Lucinda was the older sister, and she wasn't so attractive.
SUPMALE:But she was madly in love with this handsome, young silver miner named Harrison Monteith.
SUPFEMALE:But he was in love with the young and beautiful Deirdre.
LEADMALE:Then, one night, they found Harrison's body.
LEADFEMALE:He'd been mysteriously poisoned, but no one could prove who did it.
OTHERMALE:After that, the sisters boarded themselves up in the house, and they were never seen again, until the day they died.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's great.
LEADMALE:That happened in my house? Yep.
OTHERFEMALE:Terrific.
LEADFEMALE:It could be that Lucinda and Deirdre don't want their house sold.
LEADFEMALE:Which reminds me, we are supposed to meet Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley at the house at 7.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll tell you what.
LEADMALE:You tell this story to Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley, and you're gonna scare the pants off of him.
LEADFEMALE:No, I don't think so.
LEADMALE:I think Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley will be amused by this quaint little anecdote as I was.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we'll see you later.
LEADMALE:So long.

OTHERMALE:Oh, Mind.
LEADMALE:What did she say to you? ( sniffs ) She told me a story about my teddy bear.

LEADMALE:Okay, Mind, come on ( Mindy laughing, Mork grunting ) Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Mind Doctor, what are you doing? I was just checking for lumps.
LEADFEMALE:Okay We have to get this patient out of here right away.
SUPFEMALE:Nonsense, that patient is having brain surgery in two hours.
OTHERMALE:You haven't done anything to her yet? Of course not.
SUPMALE:I just came in to shave her head.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Don't you shave one hair on her chin.
OTHERFEMALE:Mindy, Mindy Hello.
SUPMALE:Mindy, Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:No, Mindy is me.

SUPMALE:Well, I think that I'm over there.
LEADFEMALE:( Mork and Mindy laugh ) Very fun, Min.
SUPFEMALE:Let's get out before they turn your head into a planter.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, let's go.
OTHERMALE:They wouldn't do that to old Mindy What's my last name again? McDonald.
SUPMALE:E-I-E-I-O ( laughs ) Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Why, she's a little delirious.
OTHERMALE:I just gave her a sedative.
LEADMALE:Her name isn't McDonald, it's McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you look very familiar.
LEADMALE:You assisted me last week in that lip transplant for Mick Jagger, remember that? Well Well, I've re-diagnosed this patient and her brain has cleared up, heh.
LEADMALE:See you later.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:No, Mind.
LEADMALE:Woo! Ahhh.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:That's a great ride.
SUPMALE:Since I usually get sick on ferris wheels.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that's wonderful.
OTHERMALE:There we go.
LEADMALE:Mind, I think I can take you home.
LEADMALE:I'll take those tonsils out there.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:There we go.
OTHERMALE:( both laughing ) Let's go, Mind.
LEADMALE:You dance divinely.
LEADFEMALE:Do you come here often? Well Ow! Woo! Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:What is going on here? I can hear you halfway down the hall.
SUPMALE:Oh, Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Roland, I'm so glad you're here.
SUPFEMALE:That doctor is behaving very strangely.
LEADMALE:Doctor, I think you should put that patient down.
LEADMALE:No, she's mine.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, doctor, please.
SUPMALE:Give Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:McDonald back to us.
OTHERMALE:No, it's not McDonald, it's McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:McDonald.
SUPFEMALE:Over 30 billion sold.
LEADFEMALE:Wanna see my arches? I knew I should have been a plumber.
LEADFEMALE:Look, uh, nurse.
LEADMALE:I, uh think I'm gonna need your assistance here, all right? ( laughs ) Min Mindy, come on, let's go.
LEADMALE:Wait! Hey, no, no, don't, don't.
LEADMALE:Don't you realize you're up six stories? Oh, I love stories.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa! Mindy, Mindy! Get back! Back! I have a thermometer here and you don't know where it's been.
LEADMALE:Mindy.
LEADMALE:I'd like to thank you all for coming and I promise I'll make a darn good Miss America.
LEADFEMALE:Be careful.
OTHERFEMALE:There's a lot of gravity down there.
LEADFEMALE:MAN: Come on, jump.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:You jump.
LEADMALE:Mind We'd better get them before they fall.
SUPMALE:No, stay back.
OTHERFEMALE:Stop! Stay back! Bruce Lee lives.
OTHERMALE:Wahhh! Wahhhh! Wahhhh! Whoa! ( growling ) ( screams ) He bit me! ( grunts ) Oh, there you are.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Burnett.
LEADMALE:Yes, I had a feeling you were on this floor when we found Dr.
LEADMALE:Brody in the closet wearing underwear and striped suspenders.
SUPFEMALE:Do you know this maniac? BURNETT: Now, he's okay.
SUPMALE:His friend Mindy McConnell got mixed up with a patient named Mavis McDonald.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Her name is Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:MINDY: Now for my first dive: A forward half gainer with a full-twist summy.
LEADMALE:Mind! ( Mindy yelps ) I'm so glad you did that.
LEADMALE:You know why? Why? 'Cause I can't swim.
SUPFEMALE:( giggling ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Here, Mindy, have some more ice cream.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, but I think I've had enough.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Keep the You know, if you have any more, we're gonna send you home in a freezer bag.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha! A freezer Freezer Freezer bag.
SUPMALE:You know, Mindy should be sore for only about a day.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be sore for about a week.
SUPMALE:Why are you sore? Well, the nurse bit me back.
SUPFEMALE:You know, this whole rigamarole proves what I always say: You gotta be sick to go in the hospital.
LEADMALE:So simple, yet so meaningless.
SUPMALE:You know, I just can't believe we had all that trouble over a typographical error.
OTHERMALE:Funny, there were no typos on the bill.
OTHERMALE:Oh, well, speaking for my future profession, first I wanna apologize.
LEADMALE:But despite what happened, doctors and nurses really do wanna help.
LEADMALE:I think you've probably gotta help them by keeping your eyes open, asking questions.
LEADMALE:Especially if you fear for your life.
LEADMALE:You know, Mind, I'm glad I saved you from that brain surgery.
SUPMALE:If not, I'd be sitting here now eating ice cream with someone I didn't know and that someone would be you.
LEADMALE:You know, Mork, what would I do without you? Well, probably sitting somewhere in front of a mirror watching yourself drool.
OTHERMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( mystical theme playing ) Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:( Orson coughing ) ORSON: Hello, Mork.
SUPMALE:Oh, Your Corpulence, you sound sick.
SUPFEMALE:Very observant, Mork.
SUPMALE:Why haven't you gone to one of the health clowns? All the ones nearby are broken.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I've been trying to find a doctor, but none of them can afford me.
SUPFEMALE:You won't believe this, sir, but on Earth, people pay doctors.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha! That's crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know.
LEADMALE:Without sick people, doctors would have nothing to do.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know that, Your Lumpyship.
SUPFEMALE:But I've learned on Earth this week that staying healthy's like everything else in life.
LEADFEMALE:It all depends on how much money you have.
OTHERMALE:Were you ill? Oh, no, no, sir.
SUPMALE:Mindy was, but she's all right now.
SUPFEMALE:I had to rescue her from a hospital.
LEADFEMALE:What's a hospital? Well, hospitals are places where Earthlings are interred while they're sick and not released until they give the hospital money.
SUPMALE:It sounds like a jail.
LEADFEMALE:Well, sort of, sir, except the food is worse.
SUPFEMALE:I guess if you get sick on Earth, you're doomed.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, no, sir.
LEADMALE:You see, most doctors and hospitals are quite good.
LEADMALE:But I also realized this week that while it's tough to be sick, it's also tough to be a doctor.
SUPMALE:See, after all, to err is human, but most people won't allow doctors to be human.
SUPMALE:Till next week, sir, nanu.
SUPFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu.
LEADFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Hey, here's one: "1963 Chevy, "only 15 miles, slight damage.
LEADFEMALE:"Call after 6 p.
SUPMALE:m.
LEADMALE:Ask for Evel.
LEADFEMALE:" Forget it.
LEADMALE:What's wrong with your old car? We're tired of going through the car wash behind a tow truck.
LEADFEMALE:Beggars shouldn't be choosers.
LEADMALE:If you don't get a new car soon, you're gonna be hitchhiking to medical school.
OTHERMALE:( Greek accent ): Eureka! They are finished.
SUPMALE:Look, my Greek cookies.
LEADMALE:They make me so happy.
LEADFEMALE:I've got to dance till my knees explode and my socks fall off.
LEADMALE:Come with me.
LEADMALE:Dance now.
SUPFEMALE:( humming traditional Greek melody ) Hey! Hey! Hey! ( shouting indistinctly ) Come, my little garbo.
LEADFEMALE:Sip on some ouzo and nibble my cookies.
OTHERFEMALE:The Greek typhoon.
SUPMALE:( Jean laughs ) All right, I'll try one, let's see You can eat them on a Monday A Tuesday, a Wednesday A Thursday, a Fri REMO: Give me those.
LEADMALE:Ah-ah! Never.
LEADFEMALE:Ah-ah-ah! Now REMO: Your cousin Nelson's here again.
OTHERMALE:Oh, hi, Nelson.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Nel ( woman screams ) Excuse me, madam.
LEADFEMALE:Nelson, what is wrong with you? I've been getting threatening phone calls.
SUPMALE:And quite frankly, it's scaring the bejeebies outta me.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down and tell us about it.
LEADFEMALE:Some member of the lunatic fringe has been calling and saying that if I don't drop out of the city council race, I'd better start praying.
LEADFEMALE:That's gonna be trouble.
SUPMALE:Mindy said you didn't have a prayer.
LEADMALE:Eh, do you have any idea who it is? No, except that it's a woman's voice.
LEADFEMALE:A woman? He's scared of a woman.
LEADMALE:( laughs ) Oh, please.
LEADFEMALE:And why shouldn't he be scared of a woman? You never heard of Lizzie Borden, Mata Hari, Ma Barker? Ma Bell.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, women have the right to be homicidal maniacs too, you know.
LEADMALE:Hey, cease and desist, quipsters.
OTHERFEMALE:My life could be at stake here.
SUPFEMALE:Nelson's right, it doesn't matter whether it's a man or a woman.
SUPFEMALE:Crank calls can really be scary.
SUPMALE:Yeah, birdcalls can be scary too.
LEADFEMALE:( squawking ) Let me tell you, obscene phone calls aren't any fun either.
LEADFEMALE:I got a whole bunch when I was living back east.
LEADMALE:I was petrified.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Did you call the phone company? No, they wouldn't press charges.
OTHERMALE:He was one of their best customers.
SUPFEMALE:( chuckles ) You know, there must be a reason that that woman is making these calls.
LEADMALE:Yeah, who would hate you enough to do something like this? I've got it.
LEADMALE:It's an old girlfriend that you used and threw away like a dirty sock.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think so.
SUPMALE:Most girls I use never call me again.
SUPMALE:It's probably political.
SUPMALE:Maybe it's one of the other candidates that's doing it.
LEADMALE:Think about it, Nelson, it'd have to be somebody conniving.
SUPMALE:Somebody who'd stop at nothing to get what he wants.
LEADMALE:Don't be ridiculous, Min.
LEADMALE:Why would Nelson call himself? ( playful theme playing ) Boop! Boop! Boop! Mork? Mork? Boop! ( whistles ) Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Think you could read a little more quietly? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:( mouths ): Boop.
SUPFEMALE:( mouths ): Boop.
OTHERFEMALE:( mouths ): Boop.
LEADMALE:It's for you.
SUPFEMALE:Why, that's amazing.
LEADMALE:How did you know that? I didn't.
SUPFEMALE:But I didn't wanna stop reading until I got to see if Lolita gets to use her crayons or not.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha! Nelson.
LEADFEMALE:What is all this? It's a disguise.
OTHERMALE:Ah, you're masquerading as a traveling flasher, eh? I got another phone call from that crazy woman.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Are you sure it's the same one? Down to the last threat.
LEADMALE:She asked me strange questions like, "Guess who's not gonna make it till election day?" Maybe she's just trying to change your political image.
SUPMALE:Yeah, she says she's gonna do it with an ax.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's terrible.
SUPFEMALE:Are you on your way to a hotel? No.
LEADMALE:Are you, uh, going out of town? No.
LEADMALE:You're staying here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank you, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:I knew that when a fella gets in a jam, the first people he should turn to is family.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, cuz.
LEADFEMALE:Ohhh NELSON: I just wanna say thanks.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Make yourself at home.
LEADFEMALE:Nelson, if I were you I'd call the police.
SUPFEMALE:I did.
LEADFEMALE:They said that a crank call isn't a crime.
LEADFEMALE:I guess they can't do anything till I'm actually dead.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe they'd investigate if you just laid there real still.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we'll deal with all this tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:In the meantime, you're safe here.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Mindy.
SUPMALE:Morky.
SUPFEMALE:It's people like you that make people like me like people like you.
LEADMALE:Right now I'm too tired to think.
LEADMALE:I'm I'm going to bed.
LEADMALE:Good night.
OTHERMALE:Nighty-night.
LEADMALE:Well, guess it's time to hit the straw.
LEADFEMALE:You mean "hay.
LEADFEMALE:" Well, if you insist.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, it's time to hit the straw.
LEADMALE:Well Good night.
LEADFEMALE:'Night.
SUPFEMALE:I feel much safer staying over here.
OTHERMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:( Nelson screams ) NELSON: Don't turn out the lights! What's wrong? I I can't sleep with the lights out.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I better read you a story, that might help.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Here you go.
LEADFEMALE:"The moon highlighted her golden hair, and she could hear the soft twittering of a nightingale as she plunged the dagger again and again into Derek's back.
SUPFEMALE:" ( playful theme playing ) Don't tell me, um, Orkan calisthenics? No, I'm working on my impression of Nelson's lava lamp.
SUPFEMALE:That's pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, guess what I'm doing.
SUPFEMALE:( snorting ) Billy Carter.
LEADFEMALE:( Laughs ) No.
SUPMALE:Oh, the Vienna Hogs' Choir.
LEADMALE:No, it's Nelson snoring.
SUPFEMALE:He kept me awake all night last night.
LEADFEMALE:Why would Nelson bring his lava lamp? It gives him a sense of security, makes him feel like he's almost hip.
LEADMALE:( laughs ) ( phone rings ) Phone.
SUPFEMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:Hello? No, he's in the shower now.
SUPFEMALE:Can I help you? I'll take a message if I can.
SUPFEMALE:( mouthed dialogue ) Something to write on.
SUPFEMALE:Pardon the delay, it's hard to get good Caucasian help.
LEADFEMALE:Hello ( indistinct speech over phone ) Mork, she says she's gonna get us too and she knows where we live.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Death, despair, doom.
SUPMALE:Come on, Min.
LEADFEMALE:We've gotta bolt the windows up.
LEADMALE:We gotta barricade the door.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, come on.
LEADMALE:Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, order some pizzas, Min.
SUPFEMALE:Make 'em frozen pizzas, we can suck on 'em, they'll last longer.
OTHERMALE:This is serious.
LEADFEMALE:We've gotta think about this calmly.
SUPFEMALE:All right, Mind.
LEADMALE:What we can do is create an electromagnetic force field.
LEADMALE:We need some zirconium and a cambrium laser.
SUPFEMALE:Now, where do you put your cambrium lasers and Hi, guys, what's all the hubbub? Get down! Get down! Do I sense danger? No, you sense threats.
LEADMALE:That woman called again.
SUPMALE:She said she'll arrange it so you can dance cheek-to-cheek with yourself.
SUPMALE:She did? Don't ever leave me.
LEADMALE:The worst part is she knows where we are.
LEADMALE:Now, we've gotta figure this thing out.
LEADMALE:Why don't you come down here and cower with us, Miss Brave? Not on the floor, on the sofa.
SUPMALE:What, you guys think she's gonna shoot us through the window? ( all screaming ) MORK: It was probably Mr.
SUPMALE:Death.
OTHERMALE:It was Mr.
LEADMALE:Barstool.
SUPFEMALE:Well, so this is politics.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I shouldn'ta left your phone number with my answering service.
LEADMALE:You left my number with your service? Well, only a few of the calls I get are death threats.
LEADMALE:I do have an attachÃ© case business to run, you know.
LEADMALE:Come on, you guys, I mean, I think we're overreacting to this whole thing.
SUPMALE:I mean, there's not gonna be any violence.
SUPFEMALE:I read the people who make phone threats rarely cut you into little pieces.
LEADMALE:How rarely? Well, never more than once.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, let's not be so paranoid.
LEADFEMALE:And let's not let this crazy woman get to us.
LEADMALE:Let's just start acting like normal.
LEADMALE:See? Now, isn't this better? ( all screaming ) Somebody broke my window.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's nothing much, Min.
OTHERMALE:It's just a smoking can.
LEADMALE:It's a bomb! Toss it, toss it! Okay.
LEADMALE:Not to me! ( Mindy screaming ) ( suspenseful theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) ( nasal voice): Well, we'll do all we can.
SUPMALE:This stink bomb is probably just an isolated case of vandalism.
SUPMALE:That's what some people said about Pearl Harbor.
OTHERFEMALE:But our lives are in danger.
LEADFEMALE:( nasal voice ): Maybe that's why Joseph Wambaugh left the force.
LEADFEMALE:This place kinda smells like cheese on a radiator.
SUPMALE:What price charisma? Well, in case the worst happens, I decided to make out my last will and testament.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:Could I have your lava lamp and your collective works of Walter Mondale? Nelson, what we have to do is figure out why somebody's after you.
LEADMALE:I've got it.
SUPMALE:I've got it.
SUPFEMALE:When you were a baby, you were abducted by a wandering tribe of albinos.
OTHERMALE:They were gonna make you their king.
LEADMALE:But you were smart, even at that young age, and you escaped by running away nude in a snowstorm.
OTHERFEMALE:Will you be logical? I'd never run nude in the snow.
LEADFEMALE:Well, here's another one.
LEADFEMALE:You were Siamese twins, separated at the head, and she thinks you got the better deal.
SUPFEMALE:Her name was Anathesia, and she's after you like Wait, I hate to interrupt you Hardy Boys in action.
SUPFEMALE:But, Nelson, is it possible that you might have offended somebody in one of your campaign speeches? I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see, my last speech was Wednesday.
SUPFEMALE:Well what did you talk about? Oh, the usual: Nothing.
LEADMALE:Try and remember everything you talked about in that speech.
LEADMALE:Well first I came out for keeping Boulder green.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that'll get the leprechaun vote.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha! But it could antagonize the businessman.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I also came out for green factories.
LEADFEMALE:Did you make a stand on anything? I did say that Boulder should have a monorail system but for safety's sake, it should have two tracks.
SUPFEMALE:And I really was firm on that one.
LEADFEMALE:That's it? I think so.
SUPFEMALE:I did come out against pornography.
OTHERFEMALE:I said that if I were elected, I'd close down every strip joint in this city.
OTHERMALE:Well, how many are there? One.
LEADFEMALE:It opened a couple weeks ago.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's probably it, Nelson.
LEADMALE:One of the strippers must be threatening you.
LEADMALE:( phone rings ) I-if that's for me, I'm not here.
LEADFEMALE:If that's her, I'm gonna tape the conversation.
SUPFEMALE:Answer.
LEADFEMALE:NELSON: I'll answer it, but don't expect me to be polite.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello? ( indistinct speech over phone ) ( phone clicks ) That's fine.
SUPFEMALE:She hung up, let's play it back.
SUPFEMALE:WOMAN ( on tape ): If you don't get out of town, the next bomb's gonna be real.
SUPMALE:And the three of you will be splattered all over Boulder.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy, we've gotta get out of here before they make human confetti out of us.
SUPFEMALE:The first thing we have to do is find this woman.
SUPFEMALE:She's gotta be one of the strippers at the Bare Facts Club.
LEADFEMALE:Eh, you can't go.
LEADFEMALE:They'd recognize you because of your eyes.
LEADMALE:Eh, it's up to you and I, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not going into any strip joint.
LEADMALE:Come on, sometimes it's your moral duty to be sleazy, so get your pasties, let's go.
SUPFEMALE:I've got faith in you, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:You could crack this case just like Sam Spade.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what a great detective.
SUPMALE:Too bad he couldn't have puppies.
OTHERFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( air hissing ) Mork, this is so embarrassing.
SUPMALE:Would you look at me? What would my grandmother say if she saw me dressed like this? Take it off.
SUPMALE:As a matter of fact, she would.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you here for the audition? Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Sid Morkenstein, William Morkis Agency.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, darling, more than you'll ever know.
LEADMALE:I represent Miss Mindy Rose Lee.
LEADFEMALE:She's the Boulder Bombshell.
LEADFEMALE:Pleased to meet you.
LEADMALE:I love the balloons, darling.
LEADFEMALE:I bet you don't have a pet porcupine, huh? No, not anymore.
LEADMALE:Does that sound like the voice on the phone? I don't think she knows how to use a phone, Min.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let's move on.
OTHERMALE:Love what you're doing, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:Let's have breakfast, lunch, dinner one day.
SUPFEMALE:Fantastic.
LEADMALE:Hello, Sid Morkenstein, William Morkis Agency, how are you? Love Hey, great-looking bear.
OTHERMALE:Sure am.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I'm in this business.
LEADMALE:So's the kid.
LEADFEMALE:Right, sweetheart? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Sure is a nice place.
LEADFEMALE:It's a lot better than the joints I've been working in.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah What are you talking about? Uh, pardon me, are you interested in politics? No, but I had an old boyfriend once that taught me how to pronounce Zai-air.
SUPMALE:( balloon deflating ) Excuse me.
SUPMALE:I bet you'd be really bummed out if some politician tried to close this place down.
SUPFEMALE:No, there are always places to work.
SUPFEMALE:We move around a lot.
LEADMALE:I hear that.
LEADMALE:But you haven't seen anyone move till you've seen the Boulder Bombshell.
LEADFEMALE:I mean I'm talking about She takes off so much you can see her bones, you know? Ho-ho-ho! Wazoo, wazoo.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha! I'm talking good times here.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, Sid? Can I talk to you for a minute? Oh sure, darling.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:We'll get back to you, I'll put you on hold.
LEADMALE:Love you.
LEADMALE:Knock off this stuff about the audition.
LEADMALE:I'm not getting up there and doing anything.
OTHERMALE:Do you think any of these ladies did it? I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:None of their voices sound familiar.
LEADMALE:And she said that she could get work anywhere, so why would they care if this place closed down? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I've got it.
LEADMALE:The owner of the club is a woman.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha! Maybe.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, girls, let's get this show on the road.
OTHERMALE:I want you to get up here and strut your stuff.
LEADMALE:Mindy, get your struts ready.
OTHERFEMALE:RON: And remember, only the best girl gets to audition for the boss.
SUPMALE:I don't think I can go through with this.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? Nelson would take his clothes off for you.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, you, with the balloons.
LEADFEMALE:You're first.
LEADMALE:Harry, give me a spot.
OTHERMALE:Do you mind? My name is Cherry Balloons, and I did the following number at a recent stag party.
LEADMALE:I got a standing ovation.
LEADMALE:Play something soft and sultry.
LEADMALE:( cabaret piano music playing ) ( balloons popping ) Okay, thanks a lot.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I think we get the idea.
LEADFEMALE:We'll give you a call, okay? Mork, you better get backstage and find out if the owner is a woman before I end up on that stage.
LEADFEMALE:Now, there, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Sid Morkenstein, William Morkis Agency, how are you? Hey, it's a great cigar.
LEADFEMALE:Too bad about Castro, huh? Listen, I've seen better dancing at the New York City Ballet, you know what I'm talking about? Hey.
LEADMALE:You gotta see the Boulder Bombshell there.
LEADMALE:'Cause there is a woman there that I want your boss to see, because when she can move it, she really moves it.
LEADMALE:It must be cream 'cause milk don't flow like that.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey.
SUPMALE:What do you want? Basically I want your boss to see the young woman here.
OTHERMALE:Even blind people go, "Something interesting around there.
LEADMALE:" The boss'll be out when he's ready, you know? All right.
LEADFEMALE:Fantastic, we'll get back to you.

LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Okay, you, you're next.
SUPMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Please play something reeking of innocence.
LEADMALE:( piano playing ) Right.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of an audience do you think we got out here, the Muppets? Well, I refuse to make artistic compromises.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Lex.
SUPMALE:Good luck, kid.
SUPFEMALE:RON: Okay, Bombshell.
LEADMALE:You're next.
LEADMALE:Mork, I can't go up there.
LEADMALE:RON: Come on, what's the matter? You ashamed of your body? No.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, let's see it.
OTHERFEMALE:Wouldn't you rather see his? Come on, I don't have all day.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, come on.
LEADMALE:What kind of music do you want? You don't want no music.
LEADMALE:Play it Acapulco.
SUPMALE:No ( piano playing ) ( inaudible dialogue ) Thanks a lot there, Bombshell.
SUPFEMALE:That was really exciting.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:It isn't fair.
LEADMALE:Her snake's doing a jungle picture, how about that? Now, listen.
SUPMALE:Don't just tell me thanks.
SUPMALE:Get in there and tell your boss that Sid Morkenstein wants to see him, man.
SUPMALE:No one demands to see the boss.
LEADMALE:Hey, well, it was just a request, really, I Um, listen, she had a little stage fright, you know? A little nerves.
LEADMALE:You know how it goes, don't you, sweetheart, don't you? I guess I'll show you how it works.
LEADMALE:Hit it, son.
OTHERFEMALE:( piano playing cabaret music ) Eh, all right, all right, all right.
LEADMALE:I ain't crazy about your act, but maybe the boss might like it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, boss, come on out here.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks, Mr.
SUPMALE:DeMille.
SUPFEMALE:Oh that's the boss.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, I think our little hunch was wrong.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you sweetheart, darling.
LEADMALE:Have your service call my service.
LEADMALE:What it was.
LEADMALE:Heh-heh! Beautiful day, great energy for the room.
SUPFEMALE:( high-pitched voice ): All right, Ron, what's going on out here? She's our man, Min.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) I wanna thank you two for preventing the untimely demise of a future city councilman.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, we're just a couple of courageous kids.
SUPFEMALE:Weren't you scared in that strip joint? Are you kidding? Mindy McConnell knows how to handle herself.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I was really amazed.
LEADFEMALE:The police came and arrested that guy.
LEADMALE:I'll never forget his last words too.
LEADFEMALE:( high-pitched voice ): "How'd you know it was me?" There's no place in this country for soprano terrorism.
SUPMALE:Did you look nice in your costume? Pretty nice.
SUPMALE:Oh, real nice.
OTHERFEMALE:And she got a ride home in a big Cadillac with a man with a wide-brimmed hat.
SUPFEMALE:This whole ugly business has taught me a very valuable lesson.
LEADMALE:I'm never gonna make a stand on anything again.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you'll make a perfect vice president.
LEADMALE:And I'm gonna be a lot more careful now that I know that people are out to get me.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't be paranoid.
SUPMALE:Next you'll say people are trying to poison your food.
SUPMALE:Eat your sandwich.
LEADMALE:Uh um What do you think? We're gonna poison you? Eat it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not hungry right now.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'll taste it for you, Nelson.
SUPMALE:There we go.
SUPFEMALE:Not bad.
LEADFEMALE:( screaming ) Mork! Mork, what's wrong? Too much mustard.
SUPFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( mystical theme playing ) Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in Orson.
SUPFEMALE:ORSON: Here I am, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, coming in loud and clear, O Great Seam-Stretcher.
LEADFEMALE:Let's dispense with the niceties, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:What did you learn this week? Well, why tell you, when I can show you? Hit it.
LEADMALE:( cabaret piano music playing ) What are you doing, Mork? Well, sir, it's what Earthlings call a striptease.
LEADMALE:You wouldn't believe this, but some humans will pay money to watch other humans take off their clothes.
SUPMALE:You mean that Earthlings would pay to watch me undress? There's a difference between a striptease and a strip threat.
OTHERMALE:Speaking of threats, sir, some humans will use threats of physical violence to get their own way.
LEADFEMALE:That's terrible.
LEADMALE:Indeed it is, because it makes other humans afraid to voice their own opinion.
SUPFEMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:They think it's safer to keep things under their hats.
LEADMALE:Oh, especially their heads.
LEADFEMALE:But I thought Earthlings prized their freedom of speech very highly, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Well, they do, sir.
LEADFEMALE:But only a few are willing to pay the price to keep it.
SUPFEMALE:Until next week, sir.
LEADMALE:Nanu, nanu.
OTHERFEMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu.
LEADFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) ( indistinct chatter ) Boy, Nelson, what a turnout.
LEADMALE:I'm really impressed.
SUPMALE:I'm really shocked.
LEADFEMALE:They came because my advisor here delivered my message to the people.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:And his message was, he was paying for lunch.
SUPMALE:( laughs ) Here's what it comes to.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll pay you next week.
SUPMALE:Next week? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:You can trust me.
SUPFEMALE:You have my word as a politician.
SUPFEMALE:Drop those forks.
SUPFEMALE:Kitchen's closed.
LEADMALE:Take that wiener out of your mouth.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry I'm late.
LEADFEMALE:I was out polling the neighborhood.
OTHERFEMALE:Why are you so out of breath? Well, it was a Gallup Poll.
LEADMALE:He's all yours.
SUPFEMALE:Well, did you get a good cross section? I didn't want to discourage you, so I just polled your friends.
LEADMALE:Must have been, uh, pretty one-sided.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it doesn't look good.
LEADMALE:Nelson, don't you think you should start your speech? Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Mork, would you mind introducing me to the general electorate? Is he here? I love what he does with refrigerators.
SUPMALE:( chuckling ): I get it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Ah! Ladies and gentlemen, please! Can we have a moment here for your attention? Thank you.
SUPMALE:I'd like to introduce a man that flattened me and my dreams, and a man who will flatten your dreams too.
SUPMALE:Let's bring him up here.
LEADMALE:Nelson Flavor, the albino wonder.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Bring him up here! ( all applaud ) ( whistling ) Thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Come on, now.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:No pictures, please.
LEADFEMALE:It hurts his little, pink eyes.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Let's move.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Good morning all you over-18ers, and welcome.
SUPFEMALE:( ringing ) Come on, Mork.
SUPMALE:I can't help it, Mindy.
OTHERMALE:I got this ringing in my mouth.
OTHERFEMALE:As I was saying, ahem ( ringing ) Do something about it.
SUPMALE:I think Orson's trying to call me, Min.
LEADMALE:( ringing ) Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, why are you ringing? Because my knocker's broke.
LEADFEMALE:Well, since you're the sergeant at arms, why don't you throw yourself out? It would be my pleasure.
LEADMALE:Will you come with me? Will you call my lawyer, Mindy? Come on.
LEADMALE:Listen to me Let go of me.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) ORSON: Orson calling Mork.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Mork.
SUPMALE:Orson calling Mork.
LEADMALE:Come in, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yo, sir.
LEADMALE:What's up? You never used the day rates before.
LEADMALE:We've got big trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Right here in Boulder City? Mork, this is deadly serious.
SUPMALE:A spaceship from the planet Necroton landed on Earth.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, not the Necrotons.
LEADFEMALE:Our archenemies? No, they're a hockey team.
LEADMALE:Of course they're our archenemies.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, good retort, sir.
SUPMALE:That's one for you, eight million for me.
SUPMALE:This is no time to be cute.
LEADMALE:They're after you.
LEADFEMALE:Me? Why me, sir? Because you're there.
LEADFEMALE:They want to know what you know about Earth to see if it's worth conquering.
LEADFEMALE:But I I don't know anything about them.
OTHERFEMALE:What do they look like? I don't know.
LEADMALE:No one's ever seen one and lived.
LEADMALE:For all I know, they could look like anything from a human to a wedge of Velveeta.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot, sir.
LEADFEMALE:That narrows it down to everything.
LEADMALE:Fortunately, it's a limited threat.
LEADMALE:The Necrotons can only survive in Earth's atmosphere for 24 hours.
OTHERFEMALE:All you have to do is what any patriotic Orkan would do in a time of war.
SUPMALE:Hide.
SUPFEMALE:Exactly.
SUPMALE:Sir.
LEADMALE:Just remember, not only is your life in danger, but the lives of every Earthling.
LEADMALE:Well, too bad you're not here, your tubby-tude.
SUPFEMALE:We could all hide behind you.
SUPMALE:Nanu, nanu.
LEADFEMALE:Necrotons.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha-ha! I'm not afraid of them.
SUPMALE:So in conclusion, I want you to remember my campaign theme: A vote for Nelson Flavor is a vote for me.
LEADMALE:MAN: Hear, hear.
LEADFEMALE:( all applaud ) ( indistinct chatter ) Mo Mork! Min, I was working on my impression of a turtle.
SUPFEMALE:What is the matter with you, Mork? I mean, you've been weird before, but never this weird.
SUPFEMALE:Orson said the Necrotons have landed and I've gotta hide.
LEADMALE:The Necrotons have landed.
LEADMALE:Of course.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? I'm talking about our archenemies.
OTHERMALE:They're here, but I don't know what they look like.
LEADMALE:They could be anything.
OTHERMALE:They could even pose as food.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mork, you want a snack? ( shrieks ) What did you do that for? It was self-defense.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, he's not feeling too well.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, well, neither is my antipasto.
SUPMALE:I'll send her a card.
LEADFEMALE:Min! Min, they could be posing as anything.
LEADMALE:That That might be the mothership.
LEADFEMALE:( suspenseful theme playing ) Mork? Mork, are you home? Mork? ( Mork shrieks ) ( screams ) What? Mork! Min, it's all right for me to sit on my face, but I don't think you can.
SUPMALE:Will you get out of there? You can't hide in there.
LEADMALE:Now, will you tell me what is going on here? Well, all right, but I gotta make it real quick.
SUPFEMALE:( mumbling rapidly ) Now, what would you do in this situation? I would slow down and speak more clearly so I could understand.
SUPMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I was just a little panicked.
LEADFEMALE:Here's the straight poop.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, the Necrotons are the scourge of the universe.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you know that Orkans have emotions.
LEADMALE:Well, Necrotons only have three emotions: Hate, lust, and greed.
OTHERMALE:No love? No way.
LEADFEMALE:And ever since I can remember, Ork has been at war with them.
SUPFEMALE:But I thought all Orkans were pacifists.
LEADMALE:We are.
LEADFEMALE:That's why every time we go to war, we have to go into hiding.
LEADFEMALE:Claude Rains would be one of our national heroes.
SUPMALE:Now, you see, all we have to do is hide long enough, then they get tired, and they go away.
OTHERMALE:Huh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what do they want with you? Well, I think they want my reports to Orson.
LEADFEMALE:You see, they want to find out whether Earth is worth destroying or not.
LEADFEMALE:( gasps ): They want to destroy the Earth? Why? Well, I guess it keeps them busy, Min.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:Well, I got to find someplace to hide, Min.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but No, I can't hide in there.
SUPMALE:I've been out of the closet for a year now.
LEADFEMALE:Yes! I'll use one of your dresses.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hm.
LEADFEMALE:Hm-hm! I'll go incognito.
LEADMALE:Wait, wait, wait, wait.
LEADMALE:Why? Why are you taking my dress? What better way to hide than your dress? You know, hiding is a drag.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Min, where did you put those tapes of Ethel Merman Sings Led Zeppelin? Mork, where are you gonna go? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, someplace where no one ever goes.
LEADFEMALE:The frozen tundra, the barren desert, a Mike Curb rally.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't there anything I can do to help? Oh, don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:Necrotons can't breathe Earth's atmosphere for more than 24 hours.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I'll be back tomorrow, unless, well Unless they find me.
OTHERFEMALE:But what'll they do if they catch you? Well, people who have dealt with Necrotons have a saying: ( Screams ) No, wait.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute, Mork.
SUPMALE:Look at it this way.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, there's over that live here in Boulder, and And so they'd never find you if you just stayed here.
LEADFEMALE:Good old logical Min, you old palooka.
LEADMALE:You're right.
OTHERMALE:I mean, the odds of them finding me here in this particular room in the next 24 hours are ( imitates computer hum ) Three hundred and sixty-two million to one.
SUPFEMALE:See? ( Chuckles ) ( screams ) ( suspenseful theme playing ) Must be my lucky day.
SUPFEMALE:MORK: Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Einstein was right, Min.
LEADMALE:Space is curved.
LEADFEMALE:I am Captain Nirvana of the Necroton black army.
SUPMALE:Kama, Sutra, fall in.
LEADFEMALE:Orkan, you have exactly five seconds to get your meaningless life together in one bucket.
LEADFEMALE:Min, those are Necrotons.
SUPMALE:They're as mean as they are ugly.
LEADFEMALE:MORK: No, stay away.
LEADFEMALE:Stay back.
SUPFEMALE:Ah.
OTHERMALE:I'm going to get all the information you have out of your little pea-brain.
LEADMALE:It's up to you, bright eyes.
LEADFEMALE:It can come out of your mouth, or I'll, uh, suck it out your ear.
OTHERMALE:They mean business, Min.
LEADMALE:Hope this room is Scotchgarded.
SUPMALE:Mork, do something.
SUPMALE:I am, Min.
LEADMALE:I'm shaking as fast as I can.
OTHERMALE:You can't just barge in here and suck out his brain.
SUPFEMALE:( laughs ) Orkan, curb your pet.
SUPFEMALE:Pet? Min, Min, heel, girl.
OTHERMALE:Heel.
LEADFEMALE:Heel.
OTHERMALE:Heel.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't worry about them.
LEADMALE:I'll guard us with a force field.
SUPFEMALE:( squeals ) ( laughs ) See that, Min? She's frozen in her tracks.
LEADMALE:She won't thaw for months.
LEADFEMALE:( gasps ) Is it spring already? Your silly, little Orkan weapons are useless against us.
LEADMALE:Mork, run for it! Silence the pet.
SUPFEMALE:I'll pet you, you bimbo! ( pulsing tone ) Mork, I'm trapped! Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not that bad.
LEADMALE:We'll have her housebroken in a month or so.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Let her go, please! Private, the transinducer.
SUPFEMALE:The pink one? Or the yellow? Oh, just give me one, you twit.
LEADMALE:All right, you cute, little hot potato, you are going to be under my power.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha! I'm afraid you've underestimated the incredible, hulking will of an Orkan.
LEADFEMALE:I scoff at your sparkling balls.
SUPMALE:Ah! Bachelor number one, if we were to go Tijuana All right, take him to the spacecraft.
LEADMALE:( Mork mumbles ) ( chuckles ) Aw, don't worry about your master.
LEADFEMALE:He's gonna be just fine in our little torture chamber.
LEADMALE:( gasps ) Hm.
LEADFEMALE:Must be the runt of the litter.
LEADFEMALE:( suspenseful theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) ( high-pitched whirring ) ( whirring decreases ) ( whirring fades ) ( gasps ) That was good.
LEADMALE:I never knew you had a talent for pantomime.
LEADMALE:No, uh, Mork I Uh Nelson, you gotta help me.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mork was kidnapped.
LEADMALE:Kidnapped? Yeah! They, uh They came in here, and they blew the door off the wall, and then they carried him away.
SUPFEMALE:Dastardly! Who did it? Three gorgeous, voluptuous women.
LEADMALE:That'd get my goat.
LEADFEMALE:No! No.
LEADMALE:They They're vicious and violent, and they're gonna do something awful to him.
LEADMALE:Like what? Well Um I can't tell you.
SUPFEMALE:Could you act it out? Oh! Oh, Nelson, I don't know what to do.
LEADMALE:Nobody's supposed to know.
LEADFEMALE:This is no stranger here.
SUPFEMALE:This is Nelson talking.
SUPFEMALE:First cousin, same flesh.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey, hey, remember when we were kids and I confided to you that I put the goldfish in Mom's clam chowder? Hm? Well, you owe me one.
SUPFEMALE:You're not gonna believe me anyway.
LEADMALE:If you want me to help you, you've gotta level with me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, all right.
SUPFEMALE:Um uh Mork was kidnapped by three creatures from this planet called Necroton, who came to Earth to suck out his brain and to And to invade To destroy our entire planet.
SUPFEMALE:( whimpers ) You can tell Mom about the fish in the chowder.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh! Nelson, it's true! I was trapped behind a force field right here, Well, somewhere, but But it was here.
LEADMALE:And then this Mindy, I understand.
LEADFEMALE:It's not easy being a single woman in the Now Generation.
OTHERFEMALE:You've got career versus marriage, tradition versus liberation, pregnancy versus being careful.
SUPFEMALE:Nelson! The stress is too much, isn't it? I'm telling you the truth.
LEADFEMALE:Stress can do funny things, like put the door on the couch.
LEADMALE:Remember how Mom used to bend spoons? She'd bend them and bend them and bend them Nelson! Look, I mean, you know me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm I'm good old logical, reliable Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't make up something like this.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:I'll help you.
SUPMALE:You will? First, we'll get you to a nice home in the country, far away from the urban hubbub.
SUPFEMALE:Why? For your mental and my political health.
SUPMALE:I'll pay for everything.
SUPMALE:Are you saying that I'm crazy? Well, Mindy, "crazy" is a relative term.
LEADMALE:And as Jimmy probably said of brother Billy, "Why my relative?" ( upbeat theme playing ) ( pulsating noise ) NECROTON LEADER: Just think, we wouldn't have even known of the existence of Earth if we hadn't found those two Bogart films when we pillaged the planet Ovits.
LEADMALE:Have they been much help to you? Not much, sir.
SUPMALE:You see, it's not accurate information.
LEADFEMALE:First of all, the Earth isn't even in black and white.
LEADFEMALE:Then it's essential we capture the Orkan for the information.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:I've already done so, sir.
LEADMALE:In fact, he's in the spaceship right now.
SUPFEMALE:Excellent.
LEADMALE:You must extract every report he's ever made to his home planet.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you can handle this, Captain Nirvana.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:I appreciate your confidence in me, sir.
SUPMALE:I have no confidence in you.
SUPFEMALE:The only reason you got the assignment is everyone else is out with the flu.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, uh Uh, don't worry.
LEADMALE:I won't let you down.
LEADMALE:As they say on Earth, "Here's looking at you, kid.
SUPMALE:" ( computer beeps ) Private Kama, bring in the prisoner.
LEADMALE:Oh, I can handle this.
SUPMALE:I know I can.
LEADFEMALE:( door hisses open ) ( moaning ) Aah! Oh! ( moaning ) Why are you making all those noises? We haven't even done anything yet.
SUPFEMALE:I know that.
LEADFEMALE:I'm trying to make you feel guilty.
OTHERFEMALE:It's an old Jewish trick.
LEADMALE:( door hisses ) All right, smart guy, turn around.
OTHERMALE:Hands in the air.
OTHERMALE:What are you gonna do to me? Why, I'm going to search you for secret weapons.
OTHERMALE:( moans ) Nothing here.
LEADMALE:Turn around.
OTHERFEMALE:( moans ) ( bell rings ) Ooh! Oh! You seem to have rung my bells.
SUPFEMALE:What are you hiding in your pocket? Is that a secret weapon? No, harmless stuff.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just glad to be here.
LEADMALE:No No, uh, it It's a yo-yo.
SUPFEMALE:Yo-yo.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes.
SUPFEMALE:We We have something like this on our planet, but without the string.
SUPMALE:How do you get it to come back? Well, we don't.
OTHERMALE:It's never been a big seller.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and here's something very special.
LEADFEMALE:This is chewing gum.
LEADMALE:Yes, we have that on Necroton.
LEADFEMALE:You put it in your mouth and you chew.
LEADFEMALE:Your mouth? Uh, well, I suppose that would work too.
LEADFEMALE:You're not gonna get anything out of me! I'm never gonna tell you anything! We'll see.
SUPFEMALE:Ar-ar-ar! What would you say if I told you that we're going to put you on a rack and stretch your body till your tiny, little bones crack? I'd love it.
LEADMALE:I'd look like Tommy Tune.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, then, maybe I'll just hang you up by your feet until your spleen slips out your nose.
LEADFEMALE:Just so happens that's a hobby of mine.
LEADMALE:Then you're gonna love it when I wrap a rope around your neck and start your head up like an outboard motor.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha! That old Orkan party trick? Of course you don't realize that we Orkans scoff at pain.
SUPFEMALE:Ar-ar-ar-ar-ar! All right, the jig is up.
LEADFEMALE:( beeping ) NIRVANA: You'll spill your guts now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no! A torture chamber.
LEADMALE:The ultimate Ramada Inn! I've gotta get out of here! Oh, no, the Supremes! We know one thing about you little, sissy Orkans, and that is you can't stand any intensive physical pleasure.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha! We'll have you moaning for mercy.
SUPFEMALE:MORK: Oh, no.
LEADMALE:No! ( mellow music playing ) Romantic music, soft lighting.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no! Not the hot tub! Not the hot tub! Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Get behind the modesty screen and drop 'em.
LEADMALE:You'll never get away with this.
LEADFEMALE:If I don't come home, every cop in Boulder will be on your tail.
LEADFEMALE:What's a supper? What's a cop? What's a Boulder? What's the difference? ( sighs ) How should we start? Maybe we should rub him down with baby oil.
SUPMALE:Baby oil? No, no.
SUPFEMALE:That'll leave a slick in the hot tub.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Well, I'm stalling for time.
OTHERMALE:Snap it up.
LEADFEMALE:I have a planet to destroy.
LEADFEMALE:MORK: All right.
LEADMALE:I'm Uh, suspenders.
SUPFEMALE:( chuckles ) Moral support.
LEADFEMALE:Pants.
SUPMALE:( snapping ) ( panting ): Hold on.
SUPFEMALE:Okay ( muttering ) Are you finished? Well, I think so.
LEADMALE:Then haul it out here, toots.
SUPFEMALE:Why aren't you naked? Well, I am.
OTHERMALE:This is just a tattoo.
SUPFEMALE:All right, you Orkan dog I'm not an Orkan dog! They have three legs and fall over every fourth step.
SUPMALE:Why don't you save yourself a lot of pleasure, hm? Talk.
OTHERFEMALE:Never! Never! My Earth files are top-secret.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Kama, Sutra, sic him.
OTHERMALE:( as Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Bill ): Oh, no, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bill! Oh! Listen, wait a minute! Under the Jupiter Convention I'm entitled to one last meal.
SUPMALE:Well, all right.
LEADMALE:What would you like? Something to go.
SUPMALE:No! No! I'll never tell you anything! Tickle him.
LEADFEMALE:( laughing ) ( snaps ) Oh! Hm.
LEADFEMALE:I must say he has a lot more spunk than I gave him credit for.
LEADMALE:Let's just get right to the A stuff and throw him in the hot tub.
SUPFEMALE:No! No! No, these are my new tennies! No! No! ( shrieking ) Ah, I love my work.
LEADFEMALE:What's in that? Bubble bath.
LEADMALE:Oh! ( wailing ) Oh, you're cruel! Sutra, blow in his ear.
LEADFEMALE:No! No! Kama, darling, kiss his little neck.
LEADMALE:No! Don't leave a mark.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Oh! Now, hold him down.
LEADFEMALE:I want to read to him.
LEADMALE:Oh, reading can't hurt me.
LEADFEMALE:I've been to Evelyn Wood.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no? What about smutty limericks? No, you're despicable! You're despicable! There once was a lady From Nezzum.
LEADMALE:Whose butt was as big No! No! ( gasps ) Yeah! Hey! That was a library book.
LEADFEMALE:We're wasting time, Your Highness.
LEADFEMALE:The Orkan doesn't seem to be breaking.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Put him on the trembler.
LEADFEMALE:No! No one has ever been able to endure that.
SUPFEMALE:What's a trembler? The doomsday machine.
LEADFEMALE:( beeps ) Oh, no, magic fingers.
LEADMALE:( beeps ) He'll talk now.
LEADFEMALE:( moans ) Oh, think bowling.
LEADMALE:Think bowling.
SUPMALE:Think baseball.
LEADMALE:Think Tom Snyder.
SUPMALE:He's formed a mental block.
LEADFEMALE:We can't break through.
LEADMALE:He's tougher and smarter than I thought.
SUPMALE:There's only one way to break through.
LEADFEMALE:Leave him alone with me.
LEADMALE:( snaps fingers ) ( door hisses ) ( beeps ) I'm sorry you did that.
LEADFEMALE:I forgot to close my eyes.
SUPMALE:Oh, you've been through such a lot.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:War is hell, isn't it? Oh, you poor thing.
LEADFEMALE:You know, this is very hard for a Necroton to say, but, well, I I'm I'm really sorry.
SUPMALE:Oh, I thought being a Necroton meant never having to say sorry.
LEADFEMALE:But you don't understand.
LEADMALE:This is my last chance.
LEADMALE:If I don't suck out your brain and destroy the Earth, well, I'm I'm ( whimpers ): I'm gonna lose my job.
LEADMALE:Oh, you poor kid.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry I was such a pillar of strength.
LEADFEMALE:And those vultures are just waiting for me to slip up so that they can come in and move into my boots.
SUPMALE:Oh, gee, I I didn't know mindless destruction was such a competitive field.
LEADFEMALE:You know, sometimes Sometimes I just wanna chuck the whole thing and kidnap a family I could call my own.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I hate to see a barbarian unemployed.
LEADFEMALE:Tell you what.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you everything I know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:How can I ever thank you? Well, a simple goodbye would be nice.
LEADMALE:Just give me any little old piece of secret information that you have for my report.
OTHERFEMALE:For instance, these people, the Americans, who is their leader? Well, they've been trying to figure that one out for years.
OTHERMALE:Um, they pick a new leader, though, every four years.
LEADFEMALE:How do they do that? With a wet T-shirt contest.
LEADFEMALE:What are the duties of this leader? Well, every spring he throws out the first baseball.
SUPMALE:After that, he throws out his cabinet.
LEADMALE:And he tries to make everything perfectly clear, except for the atmosphere and the water.
LEADFEMALE:And in cases of national emergency, he takes immediate action and books himself a trip overseas.
LEADFEMALE:Well, all leaders are alike, but what about the people? Tell me about the people.
SUPFEMALE:You want to know about all of them? Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I guess I better start with the A's.
LEADFEMALE:First of all, there's Aaron Ackalala.
OTHERMALE:He was born in Hawaii.
SUPFEMALE:He has two children, Allen and Arthur.
LEADFEMALE:Allen has a tattoo on his forearm of Jack Lord with the inscription, "Why'd you leave the show, Danno?" And his And his favorite quotation is ( imitates luau music ) His other son now raises herbs on Maui.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, how many people are there on this planet? Well, four billion, and would you believe it? They all sleep laying down.
LEADFEMALE:But to really understand this planet, you must participate in one of their sacred Earth rituals.
LEADFEMALE:It's entitled Simon Says.
OTHERMALE:You must do everything that Simon says.
SUPMALE:I'm ready.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Simon says close your eyes.
OTHERMALE:Simon says spin around twice.
LEADFEMALE:Simon says take one step up.
SUPMALE:What's the object of this game? To win.
OTHERFEMALE:Simon says you lose.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Why, you dirty rat! You'll never get away with this.
SUPMALE:Oh! Nanu.
LEADFEMALE:A privilege dealing with you.
LEADFEMALE:Come back here! ( snickers ) ( as Bogart ): So long, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Don't take wooden dollars.
SUPMALE:( normal voice ): Yeah, that's right.
SUPFEMALE:Let me go! Unhand me! Kama, Sutra, help! ( door hisses ) Oh! Aah! ( beeps ) What happened? Oh, I just accidentally backed into the machine.
OTHERMALE:Where's the Orkan? Oh, he just accidentally ran out the door.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, but we'll catch him again.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, I've got some really juicy information that I That I know will please our leader.
LEADFEMALE:( sighs ) ( beeps ) ( tape rewinding ) NECROTON LEADER: Fool, you blew it again.
SUPFEMALE:It's all meaningless drivel.
LEADFEMALE:The Orkan has tricked you.
SUPFEMALE:But I tortured him all over the place.
SUPFEMALE:Let me talk to him.
SUPFEMALE:Well, he, uh He ran away, but But we'll get him back.
LEADMALE:You imbecilia, Orkans are the best hiders in the universe.
OTHERMALE:You'll never catch him now that he knows you're after him.
SUPMALE:I have a plan.
LEADMALE:Oh, boy, do I have a plan.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, I'm gonna make him come to me.
SUPMALE:You better, captain, or you'll be space dust.
SUPMALE:( computer beeps ) What are you going to do? He seemed very attached to his pet.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I believe he called it "Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:" Catch her.
SUPFEMALE:Bring her here.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna have a lot of fun.
LEADMALE:I think I'll keep her little foot for my key chain.
LEADFEMALE:( suspenseful theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) KAMA: Captain Nirvana! Captain Nirvana! What took you so long? Well, the pet was a little hard to handle.
LEADMALE:It bites.
LEADFEMALE:Bite me and I'll remove your cheeks.
LEADFEMALE:Leave us alone.
LEADMALE:Who do you think you are? I mean, you You break down my door, you mess up my house, you kidnap my best friend and And now you threaten my cheeks? I mean, you're pushing me too far.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you think you're pushed too far, my job's on the line.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I never wanted to be in the military in the first place.
SUPFEMALE:For one thing, you have to wear these drab uniforms.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I mean, who could look good in this? The bass player from Kiss? Will you get in the cage? Wait, wait Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, uh, maybe you and I could be friends.
LEADMALE:Friends? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Like, if we were friends, we'd do nice things for each other, like, uh, I might lend you my best purse, and you might not kill me.
LEADMALE:Well, it's a cute idea, but I don't think it'll catch on.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, wait! Think about it.
SUPFEMALE:I'll bet you deep down inside, you and I are a lot alike.
SUPFEMALE:I doubt it.
LEADMALE:Uh, what do you plan to do with me? Well, I haven't made up my mind yet, but right now I need you for bait for your master.
SUPMALE:He is not my master.
LEADMALE:And how do you even know he's gonna come here? Well, I don't know.
LEADMALE:It's just a hunch.
SUPFEMALE:But I got a feeling he's got a yen for you.
LEADMALE:( clicks tongue ) It's called friendship, but obviously you wouldn't understand.
LEADMALE:Well, whatever.
LEADFEMALE:But what is it? You've never had a friend? Well, I I once felt something for a man named Torga from the planet Lepto.
LEADFEMALE:Torga from Lepto? You know him? No.
SUPFEMALE:Just the name.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, anyway, he was Well, he was a wonderful kind of guy.
SUPMALE:I mean, he had long, beautiful hair and a flowing red beard.
LEADMALE:He was He was, well, so nice and warm.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Whatever happened to him? I had him made into a jacket.
LEADFEMALE:And there's something about Mork too.
LEADMALE:Of course, he wouldn't make a very good jacket, but I like him anyway.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if you like him so much, why don? Why don't you just let him go? Oh, well, it's strictly business.
LEADFEMALE:You see, after I get all the information out of him, maybe I won't destroy him.
LEADMALE:Maybe I'll take him home with me and donate him to the zoo.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but if you do that, you might as well kill him.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Now, will you get in the cage? I'm not getting in that cage.
LEADFEMALE:How would you like to get into something a little more comfortable, like thumbscrews? If you need me, I'll be on my perch.
SUPMALE:( dramatic theme playing ) MORK: Mindy? Where are you? Min! Min! ( groans ) "While you were out.
LEADFEMALE:" How nice.
LEADFEMALE:"Dear Orkan swine, we have captured your pet.
LEADFEMALE:"If you value your life, give yourself up.
LEADFEMALE:"Otherwise, we'll realign her head, "steam-clean her thighs, and rotate her limbs.
SUPFEMALE:Yours truly, Nirvana.
SUPFEMALE:" Now, just remain calm.
SUPFEMALE:Deep breathing.
LEADFEMALE:( short, shallow breaths ) Remain calm.
LEADMALE:Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Nelson! Oh, Nelson, they got Mindy! I was gonna get her and rescue her, but now it's too late! It's my fault! It's my fault! ( sobbing ) Hey, easy, easy, easy.
SUPMALE:That's better.
LEADFEMALE:( sobs ) Nice outfit you got there.
LEADFEMALE:Pretty boss threads.
LEADMALE:I told Mindy you'd be back.
OTHERMALE:( laughing ): You're not gonna believe this.
LEADFEMALE:You know what she said? She said that you ( laughing ): Were captured by three gorgeous women from another planet.
SUPFEMALE:( laughing ) By the way, where were you? I was captured by gorgeous women from another planet.
OTHERMALE:( laughing ) You crazy nut! Where's Mindy? She was captured by three gorgeous girls BOTH: From another planet! ( both laugh ) I get it! I get it! The two of you are in this together, right? ( laughing ) No, no, no.
OTHERMALE:Nelson, no! It's true! They captured me, and they took me to their spaceship.
LEADFEMALE:Then they forced me to undress and sit in a hot tub with all of them.
OTHERFEMALE:A hot tub! ( laughing ) I get it.
LEADFEMALE:Candid Camera, right? I heard it was coming back on.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Allen Funt, come out wherever you are.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you're too much.
SUPFEMALE:Well, goodbye, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye, Mr.
LEADMALE:Funt.
SUPFEMALE:Let me know when I'm on.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mom.
LEADMALE:Three gorgeous girls from another ( upbeat theme playing ) MINDY ( gasping ): Mork! Min! Shh! You shouldn't have come here.
OTHERMALE:I couldn't leave you alone.
SUPMALE:Oh, but Mork.
LEADFEMALE:I'm only one person.
LEADFEMALE:If they catch you, the whole world is in danger.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna get you out of here, and if not, I've got a backup plan.
LEADFEMALE:What is it? Remember how I told you that the Necrotons are biodegradable.
LEADFEMALE:They can only last on Earth for 24 hours, and after that, well, bing! And by my calculations, they only have a few minutes left.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, all we have to do is just stall.
OTHERFEMALE:Hiya, toots.
SUPFEMALE:Hiya, boots.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I see my plan worked.
SUPFEMALE:I am executive timber.
SUPFEMALE:I hope you get executive termites.
OTHERMALE:Not nice.
OTHERMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:I surrender.
SUPMALE:Let Mindy go.
SUPMALE:Ha! Not a chance.
SUPMALE:But we made a bargain.
OTHERMALE:So sue me.
LEADMALE:There's something so nice about omnipotence.
LEADFEMALE:( gagging ) Ew! ( Gagging coughs ) What's wrong with him? Uh, he's He's got something caught in his throat, and he'll die unless you help him.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I need his brain.
LEADFEMALE:I better cut his head off.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Oh, I don't know what you did, but you saved me.
LEADMALE:Enough of your cheap Orkan tricks.
LEADMALE:Now, get in the cage before I forget I'm a lady.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, all right.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't want to do this, but according to cosmic rules, and those dictated by Prime Minister Fluffy, I hereby challenge you to a holotecker.
OTHERMALE:Ha! Sissy stuff.
LEADMALE:I mean, if you really want a duel, let's go all the way.
LEADMALE:The Battle of the Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh-uh.
SUPMALE:Not the Battle of the Rose.
LEADMALE:( snaps ) What's the Battle of the Rose? The greatest mental challenge in the universe, Min.
SUPFEMALE:Those with the strongest will get to keep the rose.
LEADMALE:This will be easier than Bobbing for Martians.
LEADMALE:( sighs ) All right, who starts? I'll flip you for it.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! Ugh! Captain Nirvana seems to have won the toss.
LEADFEMALE:He has elected to receive.
LEADFEMALE:It's time to begin the game with a play-by-play now.
SUPFEMALE:Five yards this way.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck to the both of you.
LEADFEMALE:( strained grunt ) ( hisses ) ( Mork muttering ) ( grunts ) ( tango theme playing ) ( upbeat big band theme playing ) ( "Tea for Two" playing ) ( upbeat rock 'n' roll theme plays ) ( upbeat groovy theme playing ) Ha-ha! You're pretty hot stuff, but I won.
OTHERFEMALE:I've got the rose.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha! But I won.
LEADMALE:You're out of air and time.
LEADFEMALE:Four, three, two, one.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha! You're gone.
LEADMALE:AdiÃ³s.
SUPMALE:Huevos rancheros, albÃ³ndigas, and anon.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you talking about? Well, you should have deteriorated, but You're still here.
LEADFEMALE:You only had 24 hours.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, those were Necroton hours.
OTHERMALE:MINDY: Oh, excuse me.
LEADMALE:Roughly how long is that on Earth? Nine hundred years.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, if I'd known that, I would have paced myself.
LEADFEMALE:( dramatic theme playing ) ( humming "Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen" ) Oh, come on, Min.
LEADFEMALE:Cheer up.
LEADMALE:Hey, I'll give you a ride.
SUPFEMALE:It was only a girl In a gilded cage Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, Min.
LEADMALE:Stop trying to cheer me up.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I know.
LEADFEMALE:It's kind of hard to frolic in the face of doom.
SUPMALE:You know, I've been thinking about all the things that have happened to me since I've met you.
LEADMALE:Well, one thing for sure, I never thought I'd end up sitting in a birdcage waiting for my brains to be sucked out by Necrotons.
LEADMALE:Well, look on the bright side.
LEADMALE:You still have your health.
SUPMALE:Mork, you know, you You didn't have to come back and risk your life to save me, but you did.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but I kind of botched up.
LEADMALE:Because if I'd done the right thing, you'd be safe in your own home when they destroyed the Earth.
LEADFEMALE:I guess we've had a full life.
LEADFEMALE:I only wish I had gotten to meet Anson Williams.
LEADMALE:Mork, there's something that I've been wanting to tell you for a long time, but I just couldn't.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what is it, Min? Well, one time when you weren't home, I put on your spacesuit.
LEADFEMALE:The helmet too? Boots and all.
LEADMALE:Are you mad? No.
SUPFEMALE:I have a confession to make to you too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, one time when you weren't home, I held your blow dryer and jumped up and down on your bed.
LEADMALE:Are you mad? No.
LEADFEMALE:I guess we've done it all.
LEADMALE:Okay, Morky, it's time to get your brain sucked.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Goodbye, Mork.
SUPMALE:( whimpers ) Goodbye, brains.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, Larry.
LEADMALE:Yaddy-yaddy, warden! Oh, Mork! Top of the world, Min! Top of the world, Mindy! Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Is this thing gonna hurt? Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:I won't feel a thing.
LEADMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:I meant me.
LEADMALE:Well, you tremendously.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Comfy? What? It would have been easier if you'd talked.
LEADFEMALE:But since we can't trust you, we'll have to take out your brain and squeeze out the information.
OTHERFEMALE:What? Sutra.
OTHERMALE:Activate the extractor.
SUPMALE:( machine pulsing ) All right, I'll take it from here.
SUPFEMALE:Prepare the ship for takeoff.
LEADMALE:And check to see if the cookies are done.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, Mork.
OTHERMALE:Boxing have been good to me, Howard.
SUPMALE:Oh! It's too late.
SUPMALE:Oh! It's not in there.
SUPMALE:I think it in my ear.
SUPMALE:( mumbles incoherently ) Whew! Uh, that was close.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm so glad you're all right.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I I thought you wanted to suck out my brains, put them in that little jar over there for the winter.
LEADMALE:NIRVANA: Oh, no, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:That was just to pretend for those two Those two barracudas.
SUPFEMALE:You see, ever since I danced the tango with you, well, Well, I felt something I never felt before.
LEADMALE:What was that? Lack of hate.
SUPMALE:Well, you know what they say.
SUPFEMALE:"Lack of hate is a many splendored thing.
LEADMALE:" Oh, Mork, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:If anyone on my planet knew what I was feeling now, well, I'd be vaporized.
LEADMALE:But, somehow, ever since I met you, I've discovered there's a woman inside of me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes.
OTHERMALE:I can see where she's hiding.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, why? Oh, why? Why? Oh, why? Why do you have such power over me? I do? Yes.
OTHERMALE:My life used to be so simple.
OTHERMALE:Up at 9, maim, torture, mutilate, and then a light supper and curl up with a good book.
SUPMALE:But now, now I have to have you.
OTHERMALE:I want to take you home with me.
LEADMALE:You'll be my slave.
SUPMALE:Oh, we'll have such fun together.
SUPMALE:Ooh! Well, we really can't.
LEADFEMALE:We can't? What could be more important than being my slave? My friendship for Mindy.
LEADMALE:You mean, you would pass up cosmic euphoria for that That thing scratching around in the cage? You got it.
SUPMALE:Maybe you'll feel differently after I put your pet to sleep.
SUPFEMALE:( dramatic theme playing ) Now, Nirvana, don't do anything rash.
LEADMALE:Mork, you still have your brain! That's the good news.
SUPMALE:There's some bad news you don't want to hear right now.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, can we talk about this, maybe discuss it? No.
LEADFEMALE:We Necrotons have a saying: "If an enemy gets in your way, you just needlepoint a sampler out of their hair.
SUPMALE:" Oh, you're a real homebody, you know that? Mm-hm.
SUPFEMALE:But since I don't have time to do all of that, I'll just part her hair down to her toes.
LEADMALE:What did she say? Oh It's just kind of girl talk, Min.
SUPMALE:Something about split ends.
SUPMALE:Listen, if you hurt her, you'll break my heart.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you can have one of mine.
OTHERFEMALE:I have three.
OTHERMALE:All right, pet.
LEADMALE:You have littered your last cage.
SUPMALE:If you come near me, I'll I'll poke you with my perch.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no! No, no! Now, listen.
LEADMALE:If you hurt her, you'll never, ever be my friend.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you'll forget about her.
OTHERMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:You never forget about a friend, even when they're gone.
LEADMALE:Oh, I don't know what I'm feeling.
SUPFEMALE:No matter what I do, I can't win.
OTHERMALE:You are driving me crazy! Mork, I think she wants to be a little more than just friends.
LEADMALE:I don't care what you call it.
SUPFEMALE:If I can't have him, no one can! Whoa! Oh.
LEADFEMALE:It's a strange way of showing affection, Min.
LEADMALE:It's time for slicing and dicing.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:Not so fast, Captain Ferrucci! Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ow! Ow! Ha! You missed the whole galaxy.
LEADMALE:Really? I warn you.
SUPFEMALE:I am the best swordsman in all of Ork.
LEADMALE:Ow! NIRVANA: Ooh! Ho-ho-ho.
LEADMALE:Well, I never actually faced a person.
LEADFEMALE:( in high-pitched voice ): But I am undefeated at capes and pictures.
SUPFEMALE:( whimpers ) Oh.
SUPFEMALE:I can't do it.
OTHERFEMALE:You win.
LEADFEMALE:I win? Oh, what did I do? I'll make a deal with you.
SUPMALE:Mork, you can't trust her.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, go peck your cuttlebone.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, I'll set your pet free.
LEADMALE:I'll I'll say in my report that the Earth was uninhabitable, if only you'll come back and be my mate.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's a wonderful offer.
LEADMALE:Can I sleep on that? Okay, okay.
LEADFEMALE:We'll go back and you'll be the master.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be your slave.
SUPFEMALE:We've heard enough.
LEADFEMALE:Drop your sword.
SUPMALE:Don't point that thing at me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm your captain.
LEADFEMALE:Our ex-captain.
LEADFEMALE:Filing false reports, that's treason.
LEADMALE:We're going to vaporize you and take the two specimens home with us.
LEADMALE:We will be heroes.
SUPMALE:See? I told you they wanted my job.
LEADMALE:Traitors deserve to suffer.
SUPMALE:I think we'll crush her slowly with the Necroton death hug.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh! Gee, that always wrinkles my clothes.
LEADMALE:Let's just vaporize her.
SUPMALE:Hey, you with the death ray.
SUPMALE:You've got a split in your tights.
SUPMALE:Okay, ladies, put your hands up.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:She can't shoot.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't know the firing sequence.
LEADMALE:Quick! The death hug.
LEADMALE:No, no, no! Don't harm her! Aah! Oh! Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Ahh, ha-ha-ha.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoo! ( rapid beeping ) Oh! I think I must have found the sequence.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, gang, reach for Mars.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I mean, up with your hands! Mork, not you! No!! Not you, you! No! Not you, them! No, you Mork! Mork! Mindy No, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:She's with me, me, me, me, me.
SUPMALE:Okay, open the door.
LEADMALE:Get out, pet.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not a pet.
LEADMALE:Okay, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Get in, goons.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Oh, we did it! NIRVANA: You know, I still don't understand.
OTHERFEMALE:I tortured you, I put you in a cage, and And yet you helped me, and, Mork, you saved my life.
SUPMALE:Well, what else would a friend do? I don't know.
SUPMALE:I never had any.
LEADFEMALE:Are you gonna let us go? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:You got the gun.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
SUPMALE:Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:We have more with our friendship than could ever be destroyed by any gun.
LEADFEMALE:Now will you let us go? Do I have to? A friend would.
SUPFEMALE:You guys sure play rough.
LEADMALE:( tender theme playing ) This time I had my eyes closed.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, me too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, goodbye, Nirvana.
SUPMALE:Next time you come to this planet, I won't hide.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what are you gonna do with Kama and Sutra? I'm gonna try to teach them what you taught me, but if that doesn't work, I think I'll have them stuffed.
OTHERMALE:Wait! W-when you have friends, does it hurt when they leave you? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:( sobs ) Well, then, I guess I've found some real friends.
OTHERFEMALE:( tender theme playing ) ( suspenseful theme playing ) Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Come in, Orson! Come out, come out wherever you are.
SUPMALE:Olly, olly fats in free! ORSON: Mork! Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'm relieved to see you're in one piece.
LEADFEMALE:Well, sir, what did you expect to see me in, a bikini, your Harper's Bazaarness? Ar-ar.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations on once again surviving the attack of the Necroton.
LEADMALE:Well, sir, this has been a week to end all weeks.
SUPMALE:I'm not kidding you.
LEADMALE:Now that it's over, have you any special observations to report? You must remember this: That a kiss is still a kiss, and a sigh is just a sigh.
OTHERFEMALE:And on Earth, friendship is as contagious as the flu.
OTHERMALE:Are you sure? Well, it must be, sir.
SUPMALE:I mean, I caught it from Mindy, then I gave it to Nirvana, captain of the Necrotons.
SUPFEMALE:You gave it away? Well, I got it right back.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, that's the funny thing about friendship.
OTHERMALE:( Australian accent ) It's like a boomerang! It comes right back at you.
SUPFEMALE:Bam! But you wasted it on a Necroton, our enemy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, but now we have one less enemy.
SUPFEMALE:There's plenty more Necrotons where she came from, Mork.
SUPMALE:Oh, but, sir, how about this for a plan? Tell you what.
LEADMALE:If everybody makes two friends and those two friends make two more friends, and two more friends, and Yeah! Out to infinity, pretty soon, we'll all be flying the friendly skies and united.
LEADMALE:Until next week, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:Nanu, nanu.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu! ( upbeat theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Hey, Nelson, have you ever thought of taking a stand on the ERA? I don't think I should get involved with Irish revolutionaries.
SUPFEMALE:That's the IRA.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you guys from Boulder ever read the newspapers? Everybody knows ERA is "earned run average.
LEADFEMALE:" You know, maybe you two should be running mates.
LEADMALE:Uh, hello, Nelson.
LEADMALE:Hi, Min.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I suppose you'd like to know why I'm walking backwards.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:No, I'm sure you have your reasons.
SUPMALE:I'd like to know.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I I lost another job, and I can't face Mind.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork! I thought things were going really great at the pet store.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, they were, but I wanted to have kind of a gestalt pet shop, so I put all the animals together.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess that was a mistake, huh? You can't imagine the sight of seeing a little chimpanzee trying to peel a goldfish like a banana.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I hope you took it away from the chimp.
SUPMALE:I didn't have to.
OTHERFEMALE:He drowned.
SUPMALE:It's dead? No, no.
LEADFEMALE:I gave him artificial respiration, and he gave me his phone number.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I've made a new friend but lost a job.
OTHERMALE:Well, you can have a non-paying job right here helping us come up with a platform for Nelson.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe it! God's been reading my mind! I don't think so.
SUPMALE:They're wearing clothes.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you go over there and talk to your friends? Hello, ladies! ( laughing ) Water's free.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha-ha.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, I wonder where all these beautiful girls came from.
SUPMALE:Maybe there's a slow leak at the Playboy Club.
LEADMALE:I didn't know Liberace had any children.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, we're the Denver Bronco cheerleaders, the Pony Express.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:My name is Mork.
LEADMALE:Nanu, and what do you do? We dance at the football games.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what's the matter? You can't get into Studio 54? I saw all of you on last Sunday's game.
LEADFEMALE:You were great.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah, you were wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:So were the Broncos.
LEADFEMALE:They won.
SUPFEMALE:They did? I didn't notice that, but you did a good job, and you were all very good.
LEADFEMALE:Your job is to cheer people up? Not always.
LEADFEMALE:Today we're here to do a charity benefit.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'm pretty good at cheering people up.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, let's pretend you're all depressed, okay? Pretend the Ayatollah Khomeini has just bought Disneyland.
OTHERMALE:And Minnie Mouse has to wear a big veil.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:First, I'd like to do a few impressions for you.
SUPFEMALE:Like to do a few impressions.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:My first impression is a California surfer watching a total eclipse.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, that's really mellow.
LEADFEMALE:My next impression is King Kong in Las Vegas.
SUPFEMALE:( grunting ) ( high-pitched screaming ) ( in high-pitched voice ) Put me down, put me down! My final impression I think you'll really enjoy is Truman Capote as an NFL quarterback.
OTHERMALE:( as Truman Capote ) It's gonna be an awfully long day.
LEADFEMALE:That's pretty good.
SUPFEMALE:If you learned a few dance steps, you could be a cheerleader.
LEADMALE:I think it's a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:Except that all professional cheerleaders are women.
SUPMALE:You know, I don't think there's any law about that.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you fill out an application at Bronco headquarters? Whoa! Tell you what.
LEADMALE:I think I will.
SUPFEMALE:If things go right and I get this job, I promise you, I'll personally spit shine each and every one of those little spangle things.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
OTHERFEMALE:One question.
LEADFEMALE:How many chandeliers died to make those costumes? When you dance, do you signal low-flying planes? ( upbeat theme playing ) ( humming ) Oh, a diaper.
LEADMALE:Mindy's seeing a younger man.
LEADMALE:And he's got a drinking problem.
LEADMALE:Sally brought her baby over yesterday.
OTHERFEMALE:You expect me to believe that ridiculous story?! Right.
OTHERFEMALE:I was a fool to think you'd fall for it.
OTHERMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:Why did you move my furniture all around? Kathy and Ann are coming over to teach me crowd excitation stimulation.
LEADMALE:What? Cheerleading to the laywoman.
LEADMALE:Mork, I really wonder if you thought this thing through.
SUPMALE:Sure I have.
LEADMALE:Haven't I? Well, if you get the job, understand the social ramifications.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I know about ramifications.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why Mary had a little lamb.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:See, a lot of people might make fun of you.
LEADFEMALE:No, they made fun of me when I was walking backwards for two miles.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, I just You know, I mean, I'll back you no matter what you wanna do.
LEADMALE:I just don't wanna see you get hurt.
LEADFEMALE:Men and women should be allowed to do anything they want.
LEADMALE:I mean, look, nowadays, there's women astronauts and women lawyers.
OTHERMALE:Women mothers.
LEADFEMALE:Right, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, what you're doing is very courageous, and it could just help the women's movement.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, all I wanna do, Mindy, is make Susan B.
SUPFEMALE:Anthony stand up and cheer.
LEADFEMALE:Susan B.
LEADFEMALE:Anthony is dead.
LEADMALE:No wonder she looks so bad on that little dollar.
LEADFEMALE:( knocking on door ) Oh, come on in.
SUPFEMALE:It's open.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no! Exploding habigines! Get rid of them! Aah, quick! They didn't explode.
LEADFEMALE:Heh-heh.
LEADMALE:They were tired.
OTHERMALE:I guess it was their mating season.
LEADMALE:Mork is, uh, rehearsing for a play that he's in.
LEADFEMALE:It's called The Attack of the Exploding Habigines.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, it's by Chekhov.
LEADFEMALE:ANN: Really? I'm a literature teacher, and I've never heard of it.
SUPFEMALE:It's a very loose translation.
LEADMALE:You probably know it as Oklahoma!.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:You're a cheerleader and a lit teacher, huh? I'm a lit teacher and a cheerleader.
OTHERFEMALE:And Kathy's a law student.
LEADMALE:Really? I thought jumping on a football field was a full-time profession.
LEADFEMALE:Are you kidding? We only get paid $15 a game.
LEADMALE:We just do it for the fun and excitement.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, there's a lot more to it than just jumping up and down.
SUPFEMALE:It includes gymnastics, dance, and lots of rehearsal.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like you have to be an all-around athlete.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, Mind.
LEADMALE:If that was true, they'd roll right off the field.
LEADMALE:Ar-ar.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't we get started? We'll start with some warm-up exercises.
OTHERFEMALE:We've got a week to teach you the routine.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! I'll get you your medication.
LEADFEMALE:It's okay.
OTHERMALE:Wait.
SUPMALE:Let's try the bike exercise, okay? All right.
OTHERMALE:Mork, you're not riding the bike.
OTHERMALE:I am.
SUPMALE:Mine's a moped.
SUPMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) Hi there, happy faces.
SUPFEMALE:ALL: Hi, Nelson.
SUPFEMALE:You look happy.
SUPFEMALE:You get lucky? No, I got an idea.
LEADMALE:Oh, you came up with a platform? No, nary a plank.
LEADMALE:Who needs a platform when I'm going to be on national television? The Gong Show answered your letter! Hardy-har-har.
LEADMALE:You know the Kennedy-Carter debates? Well, I've volunteered to debate with them.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Nelson, you can't debate with Kennedy and Carter.
LEADMALE:You see, they're running for president and you're running for city council.
LEADMALE:So what? We all put our pants on the same way.
SUPMALE:If I can humiliate them on national television, I'll go down in history books.
SUPFEMALE:You'll go down in comic books.
SUPMALE:Mind.
LEADMALE:Mind, you'll never guess where I've been.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, to Denver to file an application with the Pony Express.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Another incredible psychic occurrence.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I filled out a few applications, answered a few questions.
LEADFEMALE:That's it? Well, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:The woman said she'd make me a deal: If I won't call her, she won't call me.
OTHERMALE:Mork, that means they're not even gonna let you try out.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's not jump to conclusions.
OTHERMALE:Did they say anything else? Well, she said, "This is one pony express that carries no male.
LEADFEMALE:" That's sex discrimination.
SUPFEMALE:That's terrible.
SUPMALE:That's illegal.
SUPMALE:That's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you see? Sex discrimination, that's a great platform.
LEADMALE:I could get media coverage like that.
LEADFEMALE:Who needs Kennedy and Carter when I've got sex? Well, how is that gonna help Mork, Nelson? Are we not Americans? ( Mork humming "Battle Hymn of the Republic" ) Are we not free to pursue the job of our choice regardless of race, creed, color, or sex? And if one of my countrymen wants to shake his pom-pom, I, Nelson Flavor, will defend his right to the death.
SUPFEMALE:( imitates drums, fireworks ) Sorry, Min.
OTHERMALE:I don't know why you want that job.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, a real man just doesn't do girlie things.
LEADFEMALE:Try and tell that to Roosevelt Grier as he needlepoints on your nose.
OTHERFEMALE:I will go ahead.
LEADMALE:With Mindy's help, I'm gonna break down every sexual barrier that there is.
LEADFEMALE:Me? What can I do? Well, once I get through this, I'm gonna make you the first female quarterback.
LEADFEMALE:( suspenseful theme playing ) Watch how long the counts will be then.
LEADMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( all chattering ) ( dance music playing on stereo ) These are cheerleaders? Boy, things sure have changed since I've gone to prep school.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, how can you be a cheerleader without a baggy sweater and knee socks? I don't know, but that last move really cheered me up.
OTHERFEMALE:Will you guys stop staring? They're just a bunch of girls.
LEADMALE:Does my hair look all right? Thank you, Kim.
LEADFEMALE:That was excellent.
LEADFEMALE:You're on the team again this year.
SUPMALE:Thanks, Pam.
SUPMALE:It's good to be back.
LEADMALE:I'd like to see her in a baggy sweater.
OTHERMALE:I'd like to see her in a kangaroo suit.
SUPFEMALE:Wah-ah-ah-ah! Hi.
LEADMALE:My name's Peggy Black, and I'd like to do a cheer for you.
LEADFEMALE:Give me a B-U-N.
LEADFEMALE:Give me a C-O-S.
LEADMALE:What does that spell? ALL: Buncos? Uh, thank you, Peggy.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll be in touch.
LEADMALE:I thought you were very good.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Pam, this is the guy I was telling you about.
OTHERMALE:Mork, this is Pam Stockhaus, the manager of the Pony Express.
SUPMALE:Nanu.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Mindy McConnell and this is my cousin, Nelson Flavor.
LEADFEMALE:The Nelson Flavor who was on the news last night and called me a sexist? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Glad to know you.
SUPMALE:The Nelson Flavor who threatened to take us to the United Nations if we didn't let his man try out? That's me.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Flavor, I am not a sexist.
LEADMALE:I discriminate against no one except tall, blond politicians.
OTHERMALE:Well, that could be a lot of people.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Pam, I know you're mad at Nelson, and you probably should be.
LEADMALE:He does get carried away now and then.
SUPMALE:But let's not lose sight of what's really at stake here.
LEADMALE:We're talking about equal rights.
SUPFEMALE:Mork just wants a chance to try out for the job.
LEADFEMALE:So I heard on the news.
SUPFEMALE:Every channel.
OTHERMALE:Well, he's been practicing really hard with your squad.
SUPMALE:I mean, if he's no good, fine, but he should at least have the chance to try.
OTHERMALE:Oh, okay.
SUPFEMALE:It's against my better judgment, but I suppose it won't hurt to look.
LEADFEMALE:You're on, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:( all cheering, applauding ) Thank you.
LEADMALE:( giggling ) Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Um ( fanfare playing ) Two, four, 6.
LEADMALE:8.
LEADMALE:We'll send your team home in a crate.
SUPMALE:Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two.
SUPFEMALE:That's all, folks.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu, nanu.
LEADMALE:That was real nice work.
LEADMALE:We'll let you know.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Mork was great.
LEADFEMALE:You should let him know right now if he's on the team.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:If you wanna What we have here is a flagrant case of discrimination.
LEADMALE:If I may cite the case of "Tiny" Jane Whitman v.
SUPFEMALE:The Lubbock, Texas Little League If I could just finish.
LEADFEMALE:I was trying to say yes, you're on the squad.
LEADMALE:( all cheering ) ( shrieking ) Mork, your first game is on Sunday.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you're gonna have to practice every day.
SUPMALE:You've got a lot of routines to learn.
OTHERFEMALE:And remember, Mork, no special privileges.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, he's not looking for any special privileges.
LEADMALE:Well, the problem is, Mindy, we don't have the facilities to take care of a male cheerleader.
LEADMALE:You're gonna have to dress in the locker room with the squad.
OTHERMALE:I want total equality.
LEADFEMALE:When they jump, I'll jump.
LEADFEMALE:When they change, I'll change.
LEADFEMALE:When they shower, I'll shower.
OTHERMALE:That isn't equality.
OTHERFEMALE:That's ecstasy.
SUPMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) Standby.
SUPFEMALE:You're on.
LEADMALE:( Clears throat ) This is Stu Scully, in the locker room of the famed Denver Bronco cheerleaders, the Pony Express.
OTHERMALE:With me, Pam Stockhaus, their manager, and a few of the girls.
LEADFEMALE:Pam, I understand this is an important game for you.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's right, Stu.
LEADFEMALE:This afternoon, Denver will get an eyeful of pro football's first male cheerleader.
LEADFEMALE:What a cataclysmic event in the annals of football history.
LEADMALE:His name is Mork.
LEADMALE:And who would have thought that one day we would see a male cheerleader standing here in the Pony Express locker room? But right now let's have a random sampling.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Stu Scully.
LEADMALE:I wonder if you ladies would tell me what it's like to have a man on the team.
LEADMALE:Well, he's got a great pair of legs.
OTHERMALE:CHEERLEADER 2: And he's really become one of the girls.
LEADFEMALE:STU: Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Miss Stockhaus, what is your reaction to accusations in the press of sexploitation? Stu, for the rest of the season, we plan to keep Mork barefoot and pregnant.
LEADMALE:I wonder if I might have a word with your new star.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, well, we have three locker rooms, and I'm not sure which one he's in.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry we're late, Pam.
OTHERMALE:We'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Would say Mork is just a regular guy? I'd say ( woman screaming ) I think we found him.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Stu Scully, Denver Action News Team.
SUPFEMALE:I wonder if you'd mind answering a few questions for our viewers out there.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Nelson.
LEADFEMALE:Orson, who knew? Nanu.
SUPMALE:Ar-ar.
SUPFEMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:All you have to do is relax, speak your mind.
OTHERMALE:Well, sure.
SUPMALE:I've seen a lot of these on television.
LEADMALE:I know how to handle these interviews.
SUPMALE:Mork, how is it that a man can break the sexual barriers of pro cheerleading? We've got a good ball team here, Stu.
LEADFEMALE:A good ball club.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:But, tell me, do the girls treat you any differently than they would, say, a female member of the team? We've got a good ball team here, Stu.
LEADFEMALE:A good ball club.
OTHERMALE:Stu, can you turn that off for a second? I-I'm really scared.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I'm getting little butterflies in my knees.
SUPFEMALE:Know what I mean? Mork, the girls would like you to say a little something before we go out on the field.
LEADMALE:Come on, girls.
LEADMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Now that we're all gathered together, girls, I know we're in first place, but, hey, big deal.
LEADFEMALE:All that means is every other cheerleading squad in the league is after our hemlines.
LEADMALE:Hatfield.
LEADFEMALE:Hatfield, I know the press has been rough on you.
LEADMALE:They say you're on your last leap.
LEADFEMALE:But, hey, who believes the Enquirer anyway? Come on, now.
SUPMALE:Sassoon, Sassoon, Sassoon.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Keep in mind the phrase of that famous cheerleader, Boom Boom La Rue when she said: "Good girls don't get to Paris.
LEADFEMALE:" I want you to go out there and win this one for the zipper! Now, come on, everybody get in the middle.
LEADMALE:Pitch in! Let's go, let's go, let's go! ( all cheering ) All right, let's go, let's go! ( marching band playing steady beat ) Hi, everybody.
LEADMALE:Nelson Flavor.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Mork's friend.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I'm the guy that brought him here.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm Mork's friend.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I am.
OTHERMALE:Vote for me, Flavor! Nelson Flavor.
SUPMALE:( crowd chattering ) Sure is a big day, Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:ANNOUNCER: The Denver Broncos are proud to present the Pony Express and its newest member, pro football's first male cheerleader, Mork.
LEADMALE:Ooh, won't be long now.
LEADFEMALE:And here they are, the Pony Express.
SUPMALE:( marching band playing upbeat music ) ( crowd cheering ) Go get 'em, Mork.
SUPMALE:That's my boy.
LEADFEMALE:CROWD: Yay, Mork! Yay, Mork! ( crowd cheering ) CROWD ( chanting ): We want Mork! We want Mork! We want Mork! We want Mork! ( chanting continues ) ANNOUNCER: I'm sorry, folks.
OTHERMALE:It looks as though Mork has changed his mind.
LEADMALE:Mork, where are you going? Mork? Wait up.
SUPMALE:CROWD ( chanting ): We want Mork! Mork? Where are you? The crowd is calling for you.
LEADMALE:MORK: I'm in here.
SUPMALE:Which one? MORK: I don't know.
OTHERMALE:The number's on the outside.
LEADMALE:Am I angry? Sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, I realize it's not easy for a guy to go out in front of 73,144 people in a halter.
LEADMALE:But you squelched my chance at greatness.
SUPFEMALE:Nelson, leave him alone.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure he feels bad enough already.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, it's probably my fault.
LEADFEMALE:The Democrats have a donkey.
LEADMALE:The Republicans have an elephant.
LEADMALE:I had to pick a guy in a skirt.
OTHERFEMALE:Where is he anyway? Try 1045.
OTHERMALE:( knocking ) Mork, it's me, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you come out? MORK: Be right down.
LEADFEMALE:I'm upstairs.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:I'd ask you in, Min, but the place is a mess.
LEADMALE:Mork, come out of there.
SUPFEMALE:What happened out there? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:Felt all right when I ran on the field.
LEADMALE:All of a sudden, I looked up and I saw thousands of orange faces.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm.
SUPFEMALE:And then I felt kind of ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:Then I guess I got chicken apples.
LEADMALE:I think it's called stage fright, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Actually, it's called Orkan law, Mind.
SUPMALE:We're not allowed to have meetings of more than six people.
LEADMALE:Why not? Well, the seventh one gets stage fright.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'll tell you something, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think I would have had enough nerve to go out there in front of all those people.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Mm-mm.
LEADMALE:I really don't.
LEADMALE:But look at it this way.
LEADFEMALE:Even though it didn't work out, at least you had the nerve to go out and try something you really wanted to do.
SUPMALE:A lot of people never even do that.
LEADFEMALE:So you're not a failure 'cause you ran off the field.
LEADFEMALE:You're a success because you ran on.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Min.
LEADMALE:You made me feel better.
LEADMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Now, why don't you change your clothes, and I'll buy you lunch.
LEADFEMALE:But can we not go out that way? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:The crowd, right? No, no.
OTHERMALE:It's a linebacker, "No Neck" Nedboy.
LEADFEMALE:When I ran out on the field, he winked at me.
OTHERFEMALE:He did? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( door opens, closes ) ( suspenseful theme playing ) Mork calling Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Give me an F.
LEADMALE:Give me an A.
LEADFEMALE:Give me a T.
SUPFEMALE:Give me an S.
LEADFEMALE:Give me an O.
SUPFEMALE:What's that spell? ORSON: Mork! Sir, I was just thinking about you.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Well, I was cheering up, you pom-pomposity.
LEADMALE:It's something I learned on my new job this week.
SUPMALE:I joined a squad of lady cheerleaders.
SUPFEMALE:How did you pass as a woman, Mork? Well, I lied about my height, sir.
LEADMALE:Ar.
SUPMALE:You see, sir, everything here on Earth is divided by sexes.
LEADFEMALE:There's men's fashions, women's fashions.
LEADFEMALE:There's boy talk, girl talk.
LEADMALE:Stenographers, dictators.
LEADMALE:Do Earthlings always separate the men from the women? Oh, yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:They even have his and her towels.
LEADMALE:But the real difficulty comes when they try and separate the men's jobs from the women's jobs.
LEADMALE:Why do they do that? Maybe it's a question of quality.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, sir.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's a question of equality.
LEADFEMALE:You see, when you're dealing with people, it's hard to tell the value of the merchandise by looking at the shape of the package.
SUPFEMALE:I can paraphrase that and say, that sometimes the best man for a job is a woman.
SUPMALE:And in your case, Mork, the best woman for the job was you? Well, sir, I gave it a shot, but You know, sir, after centuries, these humans have tried so hard to prove that all men are created equal.
LEADFEMALE:It's kind of nice to know that they're still working at it.
SUPFEMALE:( as Walter Cronkite ) And on that positive note, that's all there is, there ain't no more.
SUPMALE:This is little Mork signing off from the planet Earth.
SUPMALE:Nanu, nanu.
SUPMALE:
SUPMALE:Nanu, nanu.
SUPMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( happy theme playing ) ( birds chirping ) Yes, Frank, I know you're the editor of the school newspaper, but I can't write this article.
LEADMALE:Because I think it's stupid.
LEADMALE:"Feminism: Myth or Myth-ith"? Okay, we will talk about it tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:It was a simple misunderstanding.
SUPMALE:What? They told me not to talk about it, but You know, I have one thing to say, right here and now: That goat was already dead.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want to hear about this.
LEADFEMALE:Smart girl.
OTHERFEMALE:It'll blow over in a year or two.
LEADMALE:( knock on door ) If anybody up there is listening, please save me from this insanity.
LEADMALE:Hi, there, curly lips.
OTHERFEMALE:No one was listening.
LEADMALE:Exidor.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
OTHERMALE:Is that you? Who wants to know? Mrs.
LEADMALE:Exidor's future husband.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:Mork.
OTHERMALE:I'm glad you dropped by.
SUPMALE:Exidor, why don't you sit down and take a load off your dock waders? All that rubber must get irritating sometimes.
LEADFEMALE:What's this I hear about a Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Exidor? Oh, Mork, I'm so excited.
LEADFEMALE:I just Pepe, you sit under me one more time, and you've sucked your last margarita.
LEADMALE:Now, then, where was I? Ah, yes.
LEADMALE:Her name is Ambrosia Malspar.
OTHERFEMALE:Of the Hogsbreath Gulch Malspars.
SUPMALE:Oh, I've heard of them.
OTHERMALE:I thought they were all caught.
SUPFEMALE:From the moment we met, I heard bells.
LEADMALE:Oh, she's a prizefighter, eh? A romantic, you're not.
OTHERMALE:I dropped by so I could invite you two to dinner tonight so you can meet Ambrosia.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you free? Uh, I don't think that we could Oh, of course we are.
LEADMALE:( whispers ) Mork, I don't care to meet an invisible fiancÃ©e.
OTHERMALE:Mindy, how long could it take? Where should we meet? Here.
LEADFEMALE:Say, about 8? You're picking us up? No, no, no.
OTHERMALE:We'll eat here.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, that's real convenient, Min.
SUPMALE:We don't have to make reservations.
LEADMALE:You expect me I'm supposed to Oh, please, don't worry about feeding Pepe.
LEADFEMALE:Tonight's his jai alai tournament.
SUPFEMALE:Ha, ha, ha.
SUPMALE:( door closes ) Mind, I'm real proud of you.
OTHERMALE:I know sometimes you think that Exidor is a twit, but yet you overcame your hang-ups, and you invited he and his fiancÃ©e over here for dinner.
SUPMALE:You're a credit to shiksadom.
LEADMALE:Mork Min? Stuff it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sensing a lot of hostility, Min.
LEADFEMALE:What's bothering and tickling your little innards? What's up? Okay you, Exidor, and Ambrosia.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, good, I'm glad you got that off your chest.
LEADMALE:Now, did you make that clam dip? I'm not finished yet.
OTHERMALE:EstÃ¡ mÃ¡s? Mas, mas more.
SUPFEMALE:I resent Exidor inviting himself for dinner, almost as much as I resent having to cook dinner for an invisible fiancÃ©e.
OTHERMALE:I mean, we're into the foothills of kinky here.
OTHERMALE:Have you ever considered that Exidor's fiancÃ©e might be a real flesh-and-blood woman? No.
SUPFEMALE:Me neither.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mind, I mean, Exidor means well.
LEADMALE:If this will make him happy, let him have his moment.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, people in robes have so few.
SUPMALE:( knock on door ) The lovebirds are here right now.
SUPMALE:We'll be right with you, loverisms.
OTHERMALE:Mind, I want you to be nice to Exidor, and try not to stare at Ambrosia.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, it's Exidor.
SUPMALE:And guess who's with him.
OTHERFEMALE:You must be Ambrosia.
LEADMALE:You're you're everything I imagined.
LEADMALE:I like your dress.
OTHERFEMALE:Who are you talking to? I'm talking to the lovely Ambrosia.
SUPMALE:But there's nobody there.
LEADFEMALE:I think the little lady has been smoking her braids again.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you don't see anybody here, do you? Not me.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot.
OTHERMALE:Now he thinks I'm the one that's crazy? Oh, I didn't say that.
SUPFEMALE:I just said your oil wasn't touching the dipstick.
SUPFEMALE:Did you or did you not state that you were bringing your fiancÃ©e here to dinner tonight? Methinks I hear her dainty step upon the stair.
LEADMALE:And this is my beloved All right, that's it.
LEADMALE:The party is over.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, I'm sorry I missed it.
OTHERMALE:Mork, Mindy I would like you to meet Ambrosia Malspar.
LEADMALE:( loudly ) She's over here, Min.
LEADFEMALE:I see her.
LEADFEMALE:May I sit down? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, sure.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:It's about time.
OTHERFEMALE:Be gentle with her.
LEADMALE:She could use a little Hamburger Helper.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:Your kind of problem doesn't carry the stigma it used to.
LEADMALE:Stigma? So, Mork, you're Exidor's best friend.
OTHERMALE:Tell me about yourself.
SUPMALE:Well, I guess you can kind of call me a son of a black hole.
OTHERMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:I'm, well, you know, my mom was a Petri dish, my dad was an eyedropper.
LEADMALE:Heh.
OTHERFEMALE:Kind of a cosmic clone.
SUPFEMALE:Just to double-check Mindy's the one with the problems? So, how did you two lovebirds meet? She chalked me.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me? Oh, this must be something of the new sexual revolution.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:You see, I'm a meter maid, and I was just minding my own business, just riding on my motor scooter, chalking tires, and Exy was lying on his back in the street fixing his burro.
LEADFEMALE:I bet the hard part was jacking him up, right? And I accidentally chalked his boots.
LEADMALE:Oh, um, why don't we all have some, uh, cheese hors d'oeuvres before dinner? Tell you what.
SUPFEMALE:I'll take the d'oeuvres.
OTHERMALE:Ar, ar.
SUPFEMALE:You two take your time.
LEADFEMALE:Amby and I will just sit here and make little fishy faces at one another.
SUPFEMALE:I just can't get over it.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, she's real, and she seems perfectly normal.
LEADMALE:Unless she's a hologram.
SUPFEMALE:Look at her.
LEADMALE:She she's nice, she's charming, and she's sane.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, she's nothing like Exidor.
OTHERMALE:I'll bet she's gonna be good for him.
LEADMALE:Look, even tonight, he's acting relatively normal.
LEADMALE:( shouting ) Stop that pounding.
SUPFEMALE:We're not deaf.
LEADMALE:Hold that thought.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Stop that pounding.
LEADMALE:I'm coming.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing here? Who is it, sweetheart? It's Pepe.
LEADFEMALE:It's Pepe? Looks like Pepe to me.
SUPFEMALE:No, it can't be Pepe.
LEADMALE:Pepe's playing jai alai tonight.
LEADFEMALE:What am I saying? Exidor, it can't be Pepe.
LEADMALE:Mork, Mindy, I know you're trying to protect Exidor, but it's as plain as the nose on your face what's going on, especially when Pepe's standing right there.
SUPMALE:BOTH: He is? Exidor, you promised me Pepe wouldn't be here tonight.
LEADFEMALE:But, guppy lips Why can't we ever be alone? Why does he always have to tag along? You said you wanted to light my fire, but three on a match is too much.
LEADFEMALE:But, flamingo toes.
LEADMALE:Pepe, you stay right here.
LEADMALE:Don't you dare follow us.
SUPMALE:I don't want to talk about it.
LEADMALE:I'm going to bed for a week.
LEADMALE:( comedic theme playing ) ( mouthing words ) ( knock on door ) Who is it? Oh, he's in muscatel heaven.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for the ride, boys.
LEADMALE:Come on in, Exidor.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you sit down? What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong.
LEADMALE:Ambrosia dumped me.
LEADFEMALE:She said she wouldn't marry me if I was the last prophet on earth, which I am.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'm sorry to hear about that.
SUPMALE:One day you'll meet a girl right for you in every way.
LEADMALE:Do you really think so? No, but at least you had hope for a moment.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Mork.
LEADMALE:I just dropped by to say adios.
LEADFEMALE:I'm shuffling off this mortal coil, and I want you to have all my worldly possessions.
LEADMALE:Here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:That's won It's empty.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course.
LEADMALE:That suitcase is all my worldly possessions.
OTHERFEMALE:Except for a large rock, and I'm saving that for transportation.
LEADFEMALE:You're saving a rock for transportation? Yes.
LEADMALE:I'm going to tie it to my leg when I go on vacation.
SUPMALE:In Atlantis.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on now, Exidor.
OTHERMALE:You're not going anywhere.
SUPMALE:You're gonna spend the night here.
LEADMALE:And I guarantee, tomorrow morning, things will look a lot better.
OTHERFEMALE:But what if they don't? Well, you'll have to stay here until they do, that may take forever, that's all right.
LEADMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Min.
OTHERFEMALE:It's settled.
SUPMALE:Here we go, Exidor.
LEADMALE:Time to hit the sack.
LEADMALE:A little mondo do-do.
LEADMALE:Here we go.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, this is very kind of you both.
SUPMALE:You won't even know I'm here.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:( howling ) Mork, he's baying.
LEADMALE:Of course, Min, it's a full moon.
LEADFEMALE:( howls ) ( dramatic theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) So, then what happens, the alpha says to the beta, "The muzzle, take it off.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna kiss her.
LEADMALE:" The alpha said, "why, are we nailed to a chicken?" ( laughs ) Ar, ar, ar.
OTHERMALE:That's wildly hysterical, Mork, but I'm empty.
SUPFEMALE:My life is over.
SUPMALE:I'm going out and kiss my burro goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, you can't do that.
LEADMALE:Where is the old Exidor spirit? Locked up in Ambrosia's cold, cold heart.
LEADFEMALE:Will you kindly take your boots off my sofa? Whoa, whoa, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:He's got squatter's rights.
SUPFEMALE:You gotta show some compassion, this man's on the ragged edge.
LEADMALE:If you two don't mind, I think I'll take a little hike upstairs to Mork's lake.
LEADFEMALE:The leaves are changing, you know? They just drop off, shrivel up, and die.
SUPFEMALE:It's hard to keep from laughing.
LEADMALE:That is it, Mork.
SUPMALE:He's gotta go or I'm gonna end up as looney tunes as he is.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mind, you gotta help him.
SUPMALE:You can't discard him like an old Carter cabinet member.
LEADMALE:You're right, I can't.
LEADMALE:But I can try to get Ambrosia to take him back.
SUPFEMALE:( melodramatic theme playing ) ( birds chirping ) Oh, come on, Ambrosia, why don't you tell me why you really broke up with Exidor.
SUPMALE:I'd rather not discuss it, Mindy.
OTHERMALE:Well, you shouldn't just let him go.
SUPFEMALE:Exidor is a very unique person.
LEADMALE:I mean, when they dropped Exidor, they broke the mold.
OTHERMALE:They sure did.
LEADMALE:He's kind, considerate, a snappy dresser.
LEADMALE:And let's not forget that swell sense of humor.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, why did you break up with him? Well It's that friend of his, Pepe.
SUPFEMALE:He won't leave us alone.
LEADFEMALE:We go to the swap meet, there's Pepe.
OTHERMALE:We go skateboarding, there's Pepe.
LEADMALE:Tailgating.
LEADMALE:Sometimes I wish he'd just disappear.
LEADFEMALE:Um What what exactly does Pepe look like? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:You'd have to ask Exidor.
LEADFEMALE:Then, you know that Pepe doesn't exist? Well, I wouldn't say that.
LEADFEMALE:A lot of people believe in men from outer space.
LEADMALE:I've never seen one, but that doesn't mean they don't exist.
LEADMALE:Good point.
LEADFEMALE:Exidor sees Pepe, and he's never lied to me yet.
SUPMALE:Besides, you have to believe in the man you love.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you're a very special person, Ambrosia.
SUPMALE:No, I'm not, because I haven't been totally honest with you or Exidor.
SUPFEMALE:Pepe isn't the real problem.
OTHERMALE:He's not? No.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm old-fashioned.
OTHERFEMALE:Before a couple gets married, I believe the man should ask the woman to marry him.
LEADMALE:Well, what if Exidor did propose to you? Would you marry him then? No.
SUPFEMALE:Why not? Mindy he's never told me he loves me.
LEADMALE:( tender theme playing ) What are you doing? Isn't it obvious? I'm drowning in your lake.
SUPMALE:Now get out of here and let me sink in peace.
LEADFEMALE:But I've got great news.
OTHERMALE:Ambrosia wants you back.
LEADMALE:Ambrosia wants me back? Save me.
OTHERMALE:Save me.
SUPFEMALE:Wait.
SUPFEMALE:Wait.
OTHERFEMALE:You can't.
SUPFEMALE:You'll drown.
LEADFEMALE:What do I do? Quick, grab my dinghy.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Just tread rug.
SUPMALE:I'll be right there.
LEADMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:A life preserver.
LEADMALE:Hold onto that.
LEADMALE:( imitating motor ) Hurry.
LEADFEMALE:Hurry.
LEADMALE:A grouper's got me by the leg.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:( grunts ) Whoa.
LEADMALE:Plucked from a watery grave.
LEADMALE:Tell me, when can I see my fox? Well, she's coming tonight, you have to do is one thing, and she'll take you back.
LEADFEMALE:Anything.
SUPMALE:Name it.
LEADFEMALE:All you have to do is say.
LEADMALE:"I love you.
SUPMALE:Will you marry me?" That's it, back to catfish country.
LEADMALE:No, no, wait, wait.
OTHERMALE:I thought you loved Ambrosia.
LEADMALE:I do.
LEADFEMALE:Then why can't you tell her? Mork, this may come as a bit of a surprise, but I am just a little eccentric.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:You see, Mork, I just can't get myself to say that phrase.
LEADMALE:In the orphanage where I was raised, nobody ever said it to me.
LEADMALE:You've got to.
SUPFEMALE:It's for your own happiness.
LEADMALE:But you don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:It's a psychological problem.
LEADMALE:Everyone's allowed one little hang-up.
OTHERMALE:( doorbell rings ) There she is.
SUPMALE:I can't say it.
LEADMALE:If you don't, you're gonna lose her.
SUPMALE:Now, remember: "I love you.
SUPMALE:" That's really nice, but what are we gonna do about Ambrosia? ( doorbell rings ) Hi, Ambrosia.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:EXIDOR: Let me go.
SUPMALE:I can't.
LEADMALE:No, don't grab me there.
LEADMALE:Is Exidor here? Um, I don't know.
SUPMALE:I'll check.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
SUPFEMALE:We have company.
SUPFEMALE:MORK: Mind.
LEADMALE:Be right down.
LEADMALE:Get down there.
OTHERMALE:( crashing ) I think that they're probably freshening up a bit.
LEADMALE:Exy won't go anywhere unless he's just so.
LEADFEMALE:EXIDOR: No, I won't go.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, there, dimple hips.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Exy.
LEADFEMALE:Does Exidor have something he wants to say to Ambrosia? Do you have something you want to say to Ambrosia? Can't think of anything.
OTHERMALE:Think again.
LEADMALE:You can do it.
SUPMALE:Ihave something I want to say.
OTHERMALE:I I It's impossible, I can't.
LEADMALE:My life is over.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I got a good idea.
SUPMALE:Let's play charades.
OTHERMALE:Charades? Well, you see, Exidor has trouble communicating with h-e-r.
LEADFEMALE:I love to play charades.
LEADMALE:Exidor, you be the giver.
OTHERMALE:You be the receiver.
SUPFEMALE:Exidor, go.
SUPFEMALE:Hit it.
SUPFEMALE:Uh Uh First word.
LEADFEMALE:First word.
LEADFEMALE:BOTH: Eye.
LEADMALE:I got it.
LEADFEMALE:"I love you, and will you marry me?" I thought she'd never get it.
OTHERFEMALE:The answer is, "I love you too, and you bet.
LEADFEMALE:" Oh, I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:She loves me.
LEADMALE:Exy, will you walk me home, alone? Just a moment.
SUPMALE:Pepe.
LEADFEMALE:Them wedding bells have broken up that old gang of ours.
LEADFEMALE:Hasta luego, amigo.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:You're too good to me.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd do anything for you because I love you, and I want to marry you.
LEADMALE:( upbeat wedding theme playing ) Twice in one night.
LEADFEMALE:And there's a lot more where that came from.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it took the both of us, but we pulled it off.
OTHERMALE:Hey, how about going to the deli with me? I'll buy you a soda.
SUPMALE:I still feel kind of strange about one thing.
SUPFEMALE:What? Well, I feel kind of sorry for Pepe.
LEADMALE:I mean, where's he gonna get work with an invisible green card? ( upbeat theme playing ) ( magical theme playing ) Mork calling Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Come in, great super scooper in the sky.
SUPFEMALE:ORSON: Your report, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sir, I am so excited.
OTHERFEMALE:My best friend is getting married next week.
SUPFEMALE:How long do marriages on earth last? Oh, until death do they part or a quick trip to Reno, whichever comes first.
SUPMALE:But I think Exidor's marriage is gonna last forever.
OTHERMALE:Exidor? Isn't he the one you told me was strange, even by earth standards? Ah, sir, with love, there are no standards.
LEADMALE:You see, no matter how strange or bizarre you are there's always a certain someone who'll love you for it.
LEADFEMALE:Love gives everyone a chance to be happy.
LEADFEMALE:Chance? You make it sound like a lottery.
LEADFEMALE:Well, sir, in a way, love is a lottery.
LEADFEMALE:And the only losers are the ones who won't gamble.
OTHERFEMALE:Exidor's marriage promises to be one of the most unusual in the history of mankind.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be late, and don't come empty-handed.
LEADMALE:Nanu, nanu.
LEADFEMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu! ( upbeat theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) This is gonna be fun.
LEADMALE:I haven't had home-cooked Chinese food since Uncle Chin Ho came to visit.

SUPFEMALE:" And I'll have to read it eventually, but Oh, listen.
LEADMALE:I've also got a plan.

OTHERFEMALE:Like, we'll go to China.
LEADFEMALE:I know this incredible kosher delicatessen in downtown Shanghai.
SUPMALE:It's called "Haimy's.
LEADFEMALE:" We'll go there and have moo goo kreplach.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid that still takes a little more money than you have, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't got enough to make it to the couch.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I do, but I haven't got enough to get back.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you know, there are ways of traveling without spending too much money.
SUPMALE:Well, tell us, Miss Consumer Advocate.
LEADFEMALE:Lay a few on me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there are clubs that give you discount rates.
LEADMALE:And in some situations, you can even work off your passage.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'll work my passage till it falls off.

SUPFEMALE:Johnson handing off Yo, Remo.
SUPMALE:No time for niceties now.
LEADFEMALE:I got ten bucks on this football game, and I can't watch it at home.
LEADMALE:Why, is your TV broken? No, it's got a slight case of beer bottle in the picture tube.
SUPMALE:Yesterday's game.
OTHERMALE:I got the guy coming tomorrow to de-Schlitz it.
OTHERFEMALE:You got any beer? No, I guess you'll just have to throw some wine.
LEADMALE:Remo, I've got a problem.
LEADMALE:I wanna travel.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Go! Go! Go! That's easy for you to say, but how do you do it? How do you do it without airfare? Run, you meatball, run! I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, China's a long way.
SUPMALE:If the distance doesn't get you, the tariffs will.
SUPMALE:The sharks Ah, timeout.

OTHERMALE:"Do it in the clouds.
LEADFEMALE:" No.
LEADMALE:I've got it! "May the Air Force be with you.
LEADFEMALE:" Eeh-h-h-h.
SUPFEMALE:Ugh.
SUPMALE:I've got to come up with a recruiting slogan.
SUPMALE:What was your old one? The brass just didn't like my old one.
SUPFEMALE:What was it? "The Air Force isn't so bad.
SUPMALE:" Well, you convinced me.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna join.
SUPMALE:Yeah? Yeah, I wanna walk on the wild side.
OTHERFEMALE:I wanna meet places and go people.

SUPFEMALE:You sound like real officer material.
LEADFEMALE:No, I don't want an office.
LEADMALE:I just want an application form.
OTHERMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:I'm not a recruiter.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a lieutenant in public relations.
SUPFEMALE:Are they fun? Oodles.
LEADMALE:This is an Air Force base.
LEADMALE:The recruiting office is in downtown Boulder.
LEADMALE:Just bring them your birth certificate, driver's license and your social security card.
SUPMALE:Well, the only card I got was from a guy downtown that said, "Live Lady Mud Wrestling.
LEADFEMALE:Call Lumpy.
LEADMALE:" Well, You gotta have those things, or they're not gonna let you in.
LEADMALE:( sighs ): Won't they let me in just on my personality? I can do an audition piece for them.

LEADMALE:You gotta let me in.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna travel.
OTHERMALE:I wanna join your club.

LEADMALE:Sorry.
OTHERMALE:Rules are rules.
SUPFEMALE:I know that.
OTHERFEMALE:If you're gonna be snooty, you won't get any business.
SUPMALE:Look, this is my lunch hour.
SUPMALE:Why don't you take a couple of these pamphlets and read up on the Air Force? But I'm telling you right now, they're not gonna let you in unless you have the right papers.
LEADFEMALE:Even if I'm a hard worker? I'm also a nice guy.
LEADMALE:That's it! The Air Force needs a few nice guys.
LEADMALE:( sighs ) All I have to do is convince them that I'd be a lot of fun on one of their Air Force trips.
LEADFEMALE:Up in the air Junior bird Eh.

SUPMALE:You guys want some coffee? You call that brown stuff coffee? You know, that green stuff we had for lunch today was worse than the green stuff we had last week.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's because last week it was Jell-O.
LEADFEMALE:Today it's meatloaf.
LEADMALE:Well, at least we won't have to worry about mess hall tonight.
OTHERMALE:I wonder where they're sending us.
LEADMALE:Everything's so hush-hush.
LEADMALE:Wherever it is, let's hope it's close to a McDonalds.
SUPFEMALE:Give me five.
LEADMALE:Hi, there, jet-setters.
LEADFEMALE:Attention! You're right.
SUPFEMALE:No, there's too much tension as there is already.
LEADFEMALE:Now, come on, let's relax, let's relax.

SUPMALE:First of all, do a little of these.
LEADMALE:Go, "Whoa.

LEADFEMALE:Now that we're relaxed, what's happening? We're being mobilized, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, punctual me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm right on time.
LEADMALE:Do you know where we're going, sir? I give up.
OTHERMALE:Where? I think he's been at peace too long.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm tired of being kept in the dark.
OTHERFEMALE:They never tell you anything.
LEADMALE:I hate that.
LEADMALE:You know what I hate? I hate it when you always get that little piece of popcorn You eat it, and it gets way in the back You eat it and all of a sudden, your teeth stick together, and you go "Hi, how are you?" It gets way back there and it's kind of like, uh, fur.
SUPMALE:( imitates gagging ) Excuse me, sir, if you don't mind my saying, may I suggest a little R and R? Well, if you insist.
LEADMALE:( chortles ): Ar-ar-ar-ar.
SUPFEMALE:Attention! No, no, no.
OTHERMALE:Relaxation.
LEADFEMALE:Once again, too much tension.
LEADMALE:( with Indian accent ): Try a little yoga for the mantra.
SUPFEMALE:When you get the mantra Lieutenant.
SUPFEMALE:The man said, "ten-hut!" Okay! I can't hear you! Okay.
SUPMALE:What's this, your idea of a little joke? No, my idea of a joke is this: This chicken walks into a bar, heh What's your name? Mork from Ork.
LEADMALE:Wipe that smile off your face.
LEADFEMALE:I suggest, Lieutenant Fromork, that you start acting more in keeping with the seriousness of this assignment.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, men.
SUPFEMALE:The truck will be here in ten minutes.
LEADMALE:Then you're all going on a little trip.
SUPFEMALE:Where to, sir? You'll find out soon enough.
OTHERFEMALE:But I can tell you this much: For some of us here tonight, it's gonna be full of hardship, sacrifice, and great personal danger.
SUPFEMALE:Not me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna sign up for tennis, golf, and scuba.
SUPFEMALE:( suspenseful theme playing ) ( tranquil theme playing ) La-da-da-da rule We'll take it La-da-da-da chance We'll break it We're gonna make Our dreams come true Doin' it our way Whoo-ooh ( groans ) Hi, Mork, is that you? Let me check.
LEADFEMALE:Yep.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm really enjoying this day off.
SUPFEMALE:I'm finally getting a chance to do all those things I never have time to do.
LEADFEMALE:You mean, like cleaning the pool, waxing the dog, or washing the limo? Uh, we can't afford a pool, a limo, or a dog.
OTHERMALE:See how inflation's such a labor-saving device? Oh, Min, Min, Min, you know Oh, no, Min! Attack of the Jolson people! No, Mindy! ( as Al Jolson ): Oh, Minny! Oh, Minny, Minny, Minny! ( mumbling indistinctly ) Mork, don't touch me.
LEADFEMALE:It's just a facial, to make me look better.
LEADFEMALE:Bad news, Min.
LEADMALE:I-I think it's kind of retroactive.
SUPMALE:Well, it's supposed to make me look great.
LEADMALE:I don't want you looking great, I like you looking back the old self.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:So where have you been? I went to join that travel club Remo told me about.
LEADFEMALE:What travel club? USAF.
OTHERMALE:USAF? Yeah, you know.
OTHERFEMALE:U period, S period, A period, F period.
LEADMALE:USAF.
SUPMALE:You joined the United States Air Force? Lieutenant Fromork here.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my Oh, not officially.
SUPMALE:But I just tagged along on one of their trips.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe this, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean, you tagged along on a trips? Well, I'm not supposed to tell you.
LEADMALE:It was all done on the Q-tip.
SUPMALE:Mork, it's against the law to pose as a member of the military.
SUPFEMALE:You go to jail for that.
LEADFEMALE:Now, where did you go? They didn't want us to tell.
LEADFEMALE:I can't blame them for trying.
LEADFEMALE:Because it was a crummy place to vacation.
SUPFEMALE:Will you just tell me where you went? Oh, to some nuclear dump about 30 miles out of town, as the Geiger counts.
SUPMALE:Why would you go there? They said it was an accident.
LEADFEMALE:But when we got there, it was kind of boring.
SUPMALE:I did see some guys playing a game.
LEADFEMALE:There were these 40 guys in lead suits trying to push this big cracked barrel with long poles.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think anybody won, but when they finally got into this big, lead room, ( chuckling ): They all ran outside like they had hornets in their pants.
SUPMALE:A nuclear accident? Yeah, something like that.
SUPFEMALE:Take care.
LEADMALE:Mork? ( suspenseful theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Min, it was no big deal, really.
LEADMALE:I just stood there for a couple of hours, and some people relieved me from my guard duty.
LEADFEMALE:Then I came home.
LEADMALE:How was your day? I don't know how you can be so casual about this, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You must have misunderstood what was going on.
SUPMALE:There are so many safeguards against radiation leaks.
LEADMALE:Min, I mean, it's no big deal.
LEADMALE:On Ork, whenever we have a nuclear accident, we just use Nuke-Away.
OTHERFEMALE:Nuke-Away? Well, yeah, it comes in pine scent or that exciting new fragrance, fusion.
SUPMALE:I mean, it takes the worry out of being radioactive.
OTHERMALE:Mork, we don't have anything like Nuke-Away here on Earth.
SUPMALE:Well, then how do you get rid of telltale nuclear waste? We don't.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Min, you can't tell me people with nuclear power don't have any way of disposing of the waste.
SUPMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:I mean, next thing you'll tell me is you're gonna put it in cans, right? Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:We do.
LEADFEMALE:You do.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, yeah.
SUPMALE:You do? Whoa! We gotta get out of her, Min! Come on.
SUPFEMALE:We gotta take a quick hike.
LEADFEMALE:We'll take the next egg out.
SUPMALE:Don't pack.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get you clothes at Frederick's of Venus.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, let's go.
LEADMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:We can't just leave.
OTHERMALE:If what you say is true, there are thousands of people that can be in danger.
LEADMALE:I mean, we gotta tell somebody.
LEADFEMALE:As we fly, we'll drop pamphlets saying, "Trespassers beware or you'll go bald.
LEADFEMALE:" Now, let's go.
LEADMALE:Mork.
SUPMALE:I gotta notify the authorities.
LEADFEMALE:There's one minor hang-up with that, Min.
LEADMALE:What? Well, the Air Force is the authorities.
LEADFEMALE:See, it's kind of like Catch-44.
SUPFEMALE:It's like Catch-22 except twice as bad.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we gotta tell somebody.
LEADMALE:I mean.
LEADFEMALE:The people have a right to know things like this.
LEADMALE:They just can't get away with covering this thing up.
OTHERMALE:Who's covering it up? Nixon's been gone for a long time.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:Probably the company that owns the dump.
LEADMALE:Why would they want to cover it up? Well, they usually say they don't want people to panic.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I see.
LEADFEMALE:"What they don't know won't hurt them, until it does.
LEADMALE:" Yeah.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:We'll go to the newspapers.
LEADFEMALE:Except they'd never believe us.
LEADFEMALE:You're a journalism student.
SUPFEMALE:What would you do? A good investigative reporter would get all the hard facts.
SUPFEMALE:Well, can't we just get some soft facts and let 'em petrify? I know what we'll do, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna go back to that dump and we're gonna get evidence.
SUPFEMALE:We'll take this tape recorder and we're gonna talk to the men.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:No chance, Lance.
LEADFEMALE:I can go in as an Air Force lieutenant and come out as a radioactive reserve.
LEADFEMALE:It has to be reasonably safe or they wouldn't let people in.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but maybe we're just laboratory rats in uniform.
LEADMALE:Well, I don't know, Mork, but somebody's gotta do something.
OTHERFEMALE:Goodbye, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You know, sometimes we have to think of others rather than just ourselves.
LEADMALE:( as Mindy ): Sometimes you have to think of others All right, let's see.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:Mankind.
SUPMALE:Let's weigh the action.
SUPFEMALE:Mank-i-i-ind.
LEADFEMALE:I gotta get my scales checked.
SUPMALE:Min! Mind, I'm coming! Mind, I'm coming! Mind! All right, wherever you glow, I'll glow.
LEADMALE:( suspenseful theme playing ) ( door opening ) Mork, how did you get this uniform? Well, sometimes rank has privileges, but I think the supply sergeant was a little suspicious when I asked for a size seven petite.
LEADMALE:Hey, it's Lieutenant Fromork.
LEADFEMALE:Good to see you, sir.
LEADMALE:We weren't expecting to be relieved for another hour.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, who's the guy? Oh, it's just another dog face, flyboy, junior birdman.
LEADFEMALE:( with low voice ): Uh, name's, uh, Airman McConnell, but you guys can call me Howard.
LEADMALE:McConnell, what's wrong with your voice? Eh, football injury.
SUPMALE:Know anything more about what we're not supposed to know? Just what we knew before.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, really? I kind of forgot.
LEADMALE:I had a football injury too.
LEADFEMALE:Could you kind of tell me again, word by word? Ah, you don't wanna hear about that again.
LEADMALE:Hey, Let me tell you about Angela, huh? If they hadn't called this emergency, I'd be with her right now.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Who's Angela? Here she is being crowned Miss Rocky Mountains.
SUPFEMALE:( whistles ) Whoa.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ): I can see why.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, I like 'em curvy.
LEADFEMALE:Say, how do you like 'em, Howard? Oh, I like 'em intelligent.
SUPMALE:Just how serious was that injury? Don't worry about McConnell.
SUPMALE:He's got everything that a woman wants.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Listen, we're gonna take our leave.
OTHERMALE:We'll see you later, all right? See you guys, huh? Hey, way to go, way to go.
SUPMALE:( with normal voice ): What is this? It's man stuff.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll let it go this time, but just remember I am a woman.
SUPMALE:Is my mustache on straight? Is it supposed to go up and down? No! Then it's on right.
LEADMALE:Mind, at least we passed the first test.
LEADMALE:They believed that you were a man.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:See, I told you the mustache would work better than steroids.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what do we do now? Well, we wait until somebody who knows something comes in, and then we get them to answer some questions into the tape recorder.
SUPMALE:Do you have it in a safe place? It's in my pocket.
LEADMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:Do you think we're in any danger here? I don't know, but if my knees knock any louder, I'm gonna look inside my pants and see who's there.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet you that's where they're keeping the leaking container.
SUPMALE:( door opening ) The recorder.
OTHERFEMALE:Right in my hip pocket.
OTHERFEMALE:Why did you put it back there? Shh! Ten-hut! At ease, men, I'm just checking to make sure the area's secure.
LEADFEMALE:( with low voice ): How's the situation look, sir? What's your name? Airman McConnell, sir.
SUPMALE:Are you new? About 23 years old, sir.
SUPMALE:Ar-ar! Why don't any of our men defect? Exactly how bad was the accident, sir? Nothing to worry about.
OTHERMALE:By the way, was your voice normal when you came here? Sir, I think we have a right to know why the Air Force was called in, don't we, sir? We were the closest military unit that was able to respond.
LEADMALE:Respond to what, sir? We were ordered in here to protect the public.
LEADMALE:You see, we store a lot of radioactive waste here.
LEADFEMALE:Now, most of these containers, well, they're just perfectly safe.
LEADFEMALE:However, some of them, well you You might as well keep 'em in Tupperware.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? I'm right behind you, sir, all the way.
LEADMALE:Just how bad was the accident, sir? Well, the problem is, atomic wastes have a half-life of 240,000 years.
LEADFEMALE:Now, fortunately, the spill was confined to a relatively small area.
OTHERFEMALE:We're keeping the canister in question in that lead-filled room.
SUPFEMALE:It doesn't look like anybody's health's gonna be in jeopardy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, when will we know for sure, sir? Does this kind of thing happen often, sir? Old disco injury, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I'll tell, but this has got to be kept in the strictest confidence.
OTHERMALE:I'm all ears, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) Remo, did you read about this radiation spill? It was only 30 miles from here.
LEADMALE:Who cares? I've got real problems.
SUPMALE:Re Oh, goodness, you are right.
LEADFEMALE:That apron just doesn't go with that tie.
SUPMALE:Why don't you just splash a little more gravy on the tie? Hey, I got a $30 parking ticket I gotta beat.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I get it.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna plead insanity.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm gonna try and impress the judge with what a nice guy I am.
LEADFEMALE:And I brought him one of my special sandwiches.
LEADMALE:Don't do it, Remo.
SUPMALE:He'll give you the chair.
LEADFEMALE:Very funny.
SUPMALE:Hi, there, Big Apple-ites.
SUPMALE:Mork, Mindy, did you guys see this incredible story? No, what is it? ( clears throat ): There was an accident at the nuclear dump, and the company somehow forgot to report it.
SUPFEMALE:How'd they find out about it? Someone sneaked in with a tape recorder and got proof.
LEADFEMALE:The newspaper got an anonymous tip.
LEADFEMALE:Who from? They don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Anyhow, because of the exposÃ©, the government has agreed to put all that waste in new containers.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder why they wouldn't take credit.
OTHERMALE:They'd be heroes.
LEADMALE:Well, there's an old saying.
LEADMALE:( as gangster ): Those who uncover a coverup might get covered up themselves.
LEADFEMALE:Or maybe the people that did it feel that the public's right to know is more important than being famous.
LEADFEMALE:I bet there are a lot of people would like to meet and thank the people who got that story.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, shucks, we'd prob They'd probably say it were nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you two want some lunch? Yeah, what'll What'll you have, Mork? Why don't you make us a couple of hero sandwiches.
OTHERMALE:Big ones.
LEADMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( mysterious theme playing ) Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:ORSON: Hello, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:What's new? Well, no, no, sir, it's what's nuke.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Mork, what's nuke? Well, it's short for nuclear.
LEADFEMALE:You see, this week, sir, I-I had a job guarding a leak at a nuclear dumping site.
LEADFEMALE:Guarding it from whom, Mork? Well, the people who live near the dump.
LEADFEMALE:It was very hush-hush.
LEADMALE:Why was that? Well, governments on Earth like to play a game.
SUPFEMALE:It's called "I've Got a Secret.
SUPFEMALE:" But when it comes time to tell the truth, it's "Let's Make a Deal.
LEADFEMALE:" Sounds like they don't want to burden the public with too much information.
SUPFEMALE:But, Orson, how can you prepare for the rain if you don't know what the weather forecast is? See, I believe people have the right to know everything that might affect their well-being.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe there's a good reason, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Isn't there an Earth saying that "ignorance is bliss"? Not in this case, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:You see, it's a good thing to conserve energy, but it's a bad thing to keep people in the dark.
LEADMALE:I have some specific information I'd like to relate Oh.
SUPMALE:Until next week, nanu, nanu.
LEADFEMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu! ( upbeat theme playing ) I don't think you need any more than that.
SUPMALE:Mindy, I can't thank you enough for helping me with all the wedding plans.
SUPMALE:I couldn't have done it alone.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's all right, Ambrosia.
SUPMALE:I mean, I like you, and besides, anyone who's marrying Exidor deserves all the help she can get.
SUPMALE:I'm telling you, Freelander, no matter how fast you paddle that kayak, you're never going to get Steinmatz up on those skis! He's so forceful.
OTHERMALE:That's one of the reasons I love him.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing up there? Skinny-dipping in Mork's lake.
LEADFEMALE:My last swim as a single man.
SUPMALE:From now on, it's the buddy system.
SUPMALE:I did it, I did it, I did it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:You did what? This time I did something right.
SUPMALE:I got you a wedding present that makes me so proud of myself I could squash a toad.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, I mean, you'll never guess, so I'll give you a hint.
SUPMALE:What weighs a hundred pounds and has feathers? You bought 'em an ostrich.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, you see, I didn't buy them an ostrich.
LEADMALE:Besides, where would it stick its head? Something you haven't seen since you grew up in that orphanage.
OTHERMALE:Exidor, remember this voice? ( woman whooping ) This is your life, Exidor! Yes, that's right, it's Princess Lusitania, your mother! Exidor! My son! Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:I I'm not Exidor.
OTHERFEMALE:It's been a long time.
LEADMALE:Natural mistake.
OTHERMALE:Mom! Is that you? Cuspidor! Exidor.
OTHERMALE:Of course! I'd know you anywhere.
LEADMALE:You have my gums.
LEADMALE:Mork, this is the most wonderful present.
LEADMALE:No one ever gave me a mother-in-law before.
LEADFEMALE:This time, you really did do good.
LEADFEMALE:Well, beat me with praise.
LEADMALE:I can take it.
LEADMALE:Mom, I thought you were dead.
LEADMALE:I don't think so.
OTHERMALE:Well, if she is, she leads a very active afterlife.
SUPMALE:But if she's alive, that means you deserted me.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:You were taken from me.
SUPFEMALE:I sent you out to play.
LEADMALE:A half-hour later, I went to look for you.
SUPFEMALE:Just as my foot hit the blacktop, I remembered.
SUPFEMALE:We were traveling on our way to Denver.
LEADMALE:I woke up two weeks later, being nursed back to health by Indians.
OTHERMALE:Been with them ever since.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's terrible.
SUPFEMALE:But the important thing is That's my mom.
LEADFEMALE:She never finished a bedtime story either.
SUPFEMALE:Earth to Lusitania.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're back.
LEADMALE:We're engaged, Mom.
LEADMALE:We're going to be married tomorrow.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I told her about that.
SUPMALE:When she heard about it, she said, "Mork" I suppose you two are really in love.
SUPMALE:Very much so.
LEADMALE:Your son lit up my life.
OTHERMALE:That's what I was afraid of.
LEADMALE:That's a lovely belt.
LEADMALE:I didn't know Houdini had a fall line.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Mork.
OTHERMALE:Would you help me with my suitcase? Fortunately, I came prepared.
LEADMALE:MINDY: What are you going to do with the chain? What are you doing? It's just a mother's way of saying, "He's mine.
SUPFEMALE:" I'm not leaving this house until you agree to call off the marriage.
LEADMALE:I'm just going into the other room so you can talk it over.
SUPMALE:But Mom, this isn't fair.
LEADFEMALE:After 35 years, you show up, say, "Hello.
SUPMALE:How are ya?" and chain yourself to a post.
LEADFEMALE:Mom! Mom! I think it's important in times like these we don't forget the old saying, "It's not the gift, it's the thought that counts.
OTHERMALE:" Ambrosia, are you sure you know what you're getting involved in? Oh, I know most people don't understand my relationship with Exidor, but it's very simple.
LEADFEMALE:Before I met him, all the men I went out with were quiet and conservative like me.
SUPMALE:My world was a succession of brown suits and wingtip shoes, and I said to myself, "Is that all there is?" And then I met Exidor.
LEADMALE:The last of the swashbucklers.
LEADFEMALE:Now every day is tubing the bonsai pipeline.
LEADFEMALE:That's understandable.
LEADFEMALE:I know Mindy feels the same way about me.
LEADFEMALE:He said modestly.
LEADMALE:Exidor adds so much color to my life, with his invisible friends and lakes in the attic.
SUPMALE:Sometimes I wish I had those things too.
LEADMALE:You're not mad at me for bringing home his mother.
LEADMALE:She can't be all bad.
LEADFEMALE:She had Exidor.
SUPMALE:Well, that's very generous of you.
SUPMALE:But I still don't want a woman chained up in my house.
LEADMALE:I know how to get her out.
SUPFEMALE:We'll do what the government always does.
SUPMALE:We'll smoke a peace pipe, sign a treaty, then break it.
OTHERMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:Exidor's in there and he's one silver-tongued fiancÃ©e.
OTHERFEMALE:He'll have her eating out of the palm of his hand.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see if I can find you something to eat.
LEADMALE:Mork, look what Mom's been saving for me all these years.
LEADMALE:Oh, look, little bronze baby hip booties.
LEADFEMALE:Is she leaving? She's staying?! Exactly.
OTHERMALE:Mindy, I know it can be inconvenient having houseguests but after we're married tomorrow, there'll be no reason for her to stay.
LEADMALE:She'll leave on her own.
SUPMALE:Oh, she'd leave right away if we'd promise to postpone the wedding.
LEADFEMALE:Exidor, you wouldn't.
LEADMALE:She just wants a chance to be the mother she's never been.
SUPMALE:She wants to take me for little rides on the tricycle, and teach me to play catch.
OTHERFEMALE:She'll give that up the first time she has to change your diapers.
LEADFEMALE:MINDY: Let me tell you something.
SUPFEMALE:If you call it off this time, she's going to make you call it off again the next time.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please.
LEADMALE:I don't need any girlish babble! What I need is a voice of reason! Mork Let me tell you something, if you call it off this time, she's just gonna make you call it off the next time.
SUPMALE:Now, that makes sense! If you just go ahead with everything planned she'll see that you're calling her bluff and she'll give in.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Mork.
LEADMALE:That's exactly what I'm going to do.
LEADMALE:He's so decisive.
LEADMALE:But tonight is my bachelor party here.
LEADFEMALE:What are we going to do with Mom? We could hang her out the window and let her dangle.
SUPFEMALE:( knock on door ) Grab it and twist it! Oh, glad you could make it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look, let's get one thing straight.
SUPMALE:I'm only doing this for you.
LEADMALE:I don't even like that guy in the dress that much.
SUPMALE:I do know this though, somebody deep-fried that man's brain.
SUPFEMALE:Bachelor parties in New York are fun.
LEADMALE:In Boulder, a bachelor party is a Rocky Mountain low.
LEADMALE:What's the projector for? Exidor's out getting some stag movies.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey! Now, there's a touch of class.
SUPMALE:I don't understand what the big deal is.
LEADMALE:Who wants to see a movie, Bambi does Yosemite? I brought some beer and, uh, salami over there.
LEADMALE:By the way, um, why is that chain going into the bedroom? Oh, Lucy's at the other end.
LEADFEMALE:Lucy? A woman? Of course it's a woman.
LEADMALE:We wouldn't chain a man, would we? A woman on the end of a 30-foot chain? You got it.
OTHERFEMALE:What's she look like? She's got feathers.
OTHERMALE:That's wonderful! This is gonna be a great party! Ding-dong! Nelson, come in.
LEADFEMALE:Join the festivities.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, fellow Boulderites! I suppose you've been wondering how my campaign for city councilman has been going.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm here to tell you that I am hot as a pistol.
SUPMALE:I've joined the Moose Lodge and the Elk's Club.
OTHERMALE:Then you'll really like our stag film.
LEADMALE:Where's, uh, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Exidor? I should meet the man, since I'm officiating at his wedding.
OTHERFEMALE:Showtime! Would you get out.
LEADMALE:I told you you're not crashing my party.
SUPMALE:We're packed in here as it is.
LEADMALE:Scram! Who is that? The groom.
LEADMALE:Oh, my gosh.
LEADMALE:I thought the bride was supposed to wear the white gown.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Exidor, I'd like you to meet Nelson Flavor, Mindy's cousin.
LEADFEMALE:How do you do? Nice to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:( chain rattling ) What a baby! She's rarin' to go! Ha-hah! She? Please, tell me it's a dog.
SUPFEMALE:No, it's a chick! And she's wearin' feathers! You guys are sick.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, don't look at us.
SUPFEMALE:It's her chain.
SUPMALE:Mork, hit the lights.
LEADMALE:The rest of you just find a place wherever you can.
LEADMALE:Down in front! How do you like that for an opening shot? Leaves a lot to the imagination.
LEADMALE:Are my eyes getting worse? Hold it down, please, and let the girl act.
SUPMALE:What do you think of the movie, Mork? Well, it leaves you wanting more.
LEADFEMALE:If I saw this baby twice, my boots would be full of sweat.
LEADMALE:( chain rattling ) REMO: There's nothing on the screen! Mork, Mork, can I talk to you a second? Is that Lucy? Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Yep, yep, yep.
LEADFEMALE:Mom! Mom! You can't watch this trash! Mork, wait till you see the blond girl play volleyball.
SUPMALE:Mork, I can't take any more of this! Down in front! Even if she does have a bag on her head, this is a little too rough for me, okay? Hey, you know, you guys from Boulder showed me a couple of new twists.
LEADMALE:Thanks for coming.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I enjoy a good laugh just as much as the next guy, but chaining and bagging somebody's mom isn't my idea of hijinks.
LEADFEMALE:MORK: Down in back! If you guys weren't registered voters, I'd turn the lot of you in.
SUPFEMALE:Drive safely.
LEADMALE:Spike it, honey! Spike it! How was the party? Well, things really livened up after we took the bag off of Lusitania's head.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry I asked.
LEADMALE:I enjoyed myself.
SUPMALE:I got to know Labrador better.
LEADFEMALE:Exidor, mom.
SUPMALE:Exidor.
LEADFEMALE:We could have a bachelor party every night, if he wasn't getting married tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:But he is getting married tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Not necessarily! The old princess has an extra card up her sleeve.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I wondered why she wasn't playing with a full deck.
LEADMALE:I'm going to put myself into a trance, and I'm going to stay there until the marriage is called off or until I die.
LEADMALE:Well, let's look on the bright side.
LEADMALE:I could've found his father too.
LEADMALE:JEAN: Her pupil dilation is normal, her pulse is normal, and her posture's pretty good.
LEADMALE:So, what does that mean? When a person is in a real trance, their heartbeat slows way down.
LEADMALE:I knew it.
LEADMALE:Did you hear that, Ambrosia? Jeanie agrees that the princess is faking it.
LEADMALE:AMBROSIA: ( monotone ) Yahoo.
LEADMALE:What are you gonna do with ( chuckles ) during the ceremony? Well, fortunately, it isn't here, it's Oh, you haven't heard this one.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, are you ready for this one? Exidor wanted to have it in the woods by a lake, so we're having it in the attic.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, it must be a lovely world he lives in.
LEADMALE:He and Mork are up there right now clearing out the underbrush.
LEADMALE:When Remo and I come back for the wedding, we'll bring the rest of the food.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:I think I'll also bring my snakebite kit.
LEADMALE:If you have any trouble finding us, make a left at the waterfall.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Okay.
SUPFEMALE:This is an attic.
LEADFEMALE:A man wouldn't get married in an attic.
SUPMALE:But then, most men wouldn't chain and bag their mothers, either.
OTHERMALE:What's happening to our society? I don't think you understand.
LEADFEMALE:Exidor's a little eccentric.
SUPMALE:He even wrote up his own nuptials.
LEADMALE:I hope it doesn't start, "There once was a bridegroom named Exie" Smells like tuna fish.
SUPMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:I've been pleading with Mom, but I don't think she's going to make it to the wedding.
LEADMALE:She just sits there, staring into space, sucking the filling out of a Twinkie.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you worry about that.
SUPFEMALE:This is your day.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you very much, dear.
SUPFEMALE:That's deeply appreciated.
LEADMALE:Who is that woman? How come she gets invited to my wedding, and burro is sitting out there cooling his hooves.
LEADFEMALE:MINDY: Mork, start the music.
SUPMALE:She's ready.
SUPFEMALE:( "Wedding March" plays ) ( clears throat ) "Dearly beloved, "we are gathered here today "in this beautiful forest on the shore of this silvery lake" Is anybody buying this? ( chains rattling ) Stop! ( gasping ) I can't go on! That's my mother down there! I Oh! Ambrosia could we just postpone the wedding for a month? Please, doe eyes? Oh, Exidor, I don't want to tell you what to do.
LEADMALE:I just want to know where I stand.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, and you said you loved me.
SUPFEMALE:That was nice.
LEADMALE:Now, I know you also love your mother, but there comes a time when a son has to cut the cord, even if he needs a hacksaw to do it.
OTHERFEMALE:But it's your decision.
SUPMALE:I just wish you'd make it soon because I think I'm going to cry.
OTHERMALE:Oh, her little doe eyes are leaking.
SUPMALE:( chains rattling ) I've had enough of this! A wedding should be a happy occasion.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, she's my gift, I take responsibility for this.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, what are you going to do? We've talked until we're blue in the face.
OTHERMALE:Including you.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, her mind is made up.
LEADFEMALE:She's not gonna change it.
SUPMALE:Mindy, you don't understand, I have a superior mind and PHD in gestalt car wash.
LEADMALE:Now, I know what she needs.
LEADMALE:She needs a good old-fashioned dose of honest cruelty.
OTHERMALE:Princess Lusitania, there's some things we have to get straight.
LEADFEMALE:( imitating Native American ): Time now for a powwow, huh? ( normal voice ): Uh, you say you love Exidor.
LEADMALE:Well, he's upstairs about to have one of the happiest moments of his life, and you're down here making him miserable.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, why don't you go upstairs and join the wedding? Listen, they're gonna get married with or without you.
LEADMALE:Now, Princess Lusitania, now "Princess Lusitania," that's not even your real name.
LEADMALE:I found out your maiden name was.
LEADMALE:"Bloomasnitzpistle.
LEADMALE:" Now, come on! Drop the act! Oh, no, you don't have to drop it that much.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, you're molting.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hey, come on, now.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to see you cry.
SUPFEMALE:( as Al Jolson ): Mammy Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:That's the wrong song to use right now.
LEADMALE:It's not fair, Mork.
LEADMALE:I'm 60 years old, and I never really had a son.
SUPMALE:I don't even have any memories.
LEADMALE:Well, I know it's not fair, but you're gonna lose a very special memory right now.
LEADMALE:I mean, I know I know life can be real cruel sometimes because you can't relive the past, but, hey, you're real lucky.
LEADMALE:Lucky? Yeah, I mean, you have a chance here to get two memories for the price of one.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna have the memories of a son and a daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:and then he rejects me.
SUPFEMALE:I guess mothers always lose, don't they? ALL: Well? Well, I blew it.
LEADFEMALE:ALL: Oh.
LEADFEMALE:She's packing her chains and heading back to the wigwam.
LEADMALE:Would you like to say goodbye? Yes, I would but right now, marrying you is the most important thing to me.
SUPFEMALE:Hit the music, Mork! ( "Wedding March" plays ) ( clears throat ) "Dearly beloved, "we are gathered here LUSITANIA: Exidor Oh.
LEADMALE:I was thinking about what Mork had to say.
OTHERMALE:He was right, and I was wrong.
LEADFEMALE:I want very much to see your wedding, Exidor.
SUPFEMALE:But I'll do it and stay on one condition.
OTHERMALE:That you'll forgive me and be my daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mom.
LEADMALE:Welcome to the family.
OTHERMALE:"Dearly beloved, "we are gathered here today "in this beautiful forest, on the shore of this silvery lake" Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Yo, hippo hips! ( imitating an elephant ) ORSON: Animal jokes, Mork? Been to the zoo again? Well, not exactly, sir.
LEADFEMALE:I got Exidor to the attic on time.
LEADMALE:Nothing worse than a man who's late to his own attic.
LEADMALE:Well, he and Ambrosia finally tied the knot.
SUPMALE:Now, it's double or nothing.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes.
OTHERMALE:Exidor's wedding.
SUPMALE:How does an earthling go about getting married? Well, sir, you give a little blood, you get a license, and then you're in business.
LEADMALE:Humans need a license for marriage? Is that like getting a driver's license, Mork? Well, not really, sir.
LEADFEMALE:You see, they make you take a test to learn to drive, but the only test of marriage is the test of time.
LEADMALE:In that case, is it worth the risk? Well, sir, I think marriage is an emotional investment, and in these inflated times, it's a special bond between two people that still yields the highest dividends.
LEADMALE:Till next week, sir.
LEADMALE:Nanu, nanu.
SUPFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu! ( upbeat theme playing ) MINDY: Hey, how'd you enjoy your first tennis game? Well, my favorite part was jumping over the net.
LEADMALE:The winner jumps over the net, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:That's why you collided with Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Clayton.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but tennis is different all over the universe.
LEADFEMALE:For example, on Sperious 4, everyone has 16 arms, and tennis elbow is the number-one killer.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know they had tennis on other planets.
LEADMALE:Only where there's gravity.
LEADMALE:Imagine no gravity? Service.
SUPFEMALE:( Shrieking ) Also, on the asteroid, the winner gets to eat the loser, and the bad players keep rice pilaf in their pockets.
LEADMALE:Talk about your "sudden death.
LEADMALE:" Oh, look, a telegram.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, I wonder who it's from.
LEADFEMALE:Well, in Ork, we always sign on the inside.
SUPFEMALE:We do the same thing on Earth.
SUPMALE:Wow, parallel evolution.
LEADMALE:First, fire.
LEADMALE:Then the wheel.
LEADMALE:Now this.
LEADMALE:Let's see.
OTHERFEMALE:"Set two extra places at dinner tonight.
LEADMALE:And remember, I hate carrots.
LEADMALE:Love, Dad.
LEADMALE:" Mork, Dad and Grandma are coming in! Hazzah! Massah Fred and missah Cora done come home! Teppie, Gubie, everyone come in from the field! ( imitating banjo ) Mork, we haven't seen them in about eight months.
OTHERFEMALE:It's 2.
LEADMALE:9% of our life so far.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, I miss them.
SUPMALE:I miss them too.
LEADMALE:Oh, remember how Dad used to take us bowling? Oh, yeah, he'd always want me to rest my head in the ball return.
LEADFEMALE:He did.
LEADFEMALE:We got to get this place cleaned up.
OTHERMALE:Let's see, I'll go to the store and buy some flowers.
LEADMALE:I can make my favorite dish for dinner, wieners tartare.
SUPFEMALE:We can have it medium.
LEADMALE:No, I think I'll fix dinner.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see, I'll go to the flower store, and then the grocery Uh, do you think you could do the dishes for me? All right, I'd like to start by doing my impression of an art deco teapot.
LEADFEMALE:Now crystal stemware.
LEADFEMALE:( high-pitched keening ) And a Crock-Pot waiting for some chicken.
LEADFEMALE:( foreign accent ) where's the chicken? Where is the chicken? I'll see you a little later.
LEADMALE:( normal voice ) Bye, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:( sighs ) I thought it was funny.
SUPMALE:You know, I just can't believe Dad and Grandma are coming in.
OTHERMALE:I'm just so excited I can hardly sit still.
LEADMALE:You want me to tie you up? ( knock on door ) Oh! Dad! Surprise! Oh, Daddy! Mindy.
SUPMALE:Oh, honey, oh.
LEADMALE:Granny, is that a new dress? Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Kids, this is Cathy.
LEADFEMALE:She's with the orchestra.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mork.
LEADMALE:I feel as though I know you both already.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, a psychic and a clairvoyant with ESP.
LEADMALE:Yeah, close.
LEADMALE:She's a good listener.
SUPMALE:I've talked her ear off about my little girl and my little, uh, Mork.
LEADMALE:Where's Grandma? She couldn't come? Oh, she's visiting your uncle in Boston.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Well, how is she? How are you? How's everybody? Come on in.
LEADMALE:We'll catch up on things during dinner.
LEADFEMALE:First, Cathy and I want to tell you the news.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what news? We were married yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:Wow! Well, congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry I don't have any rice, but, here, Doritos are forever.
LEADFEMALE:Well, ( chuckles ) you did tell me he was different.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:FRED: Is something wrong, honey? Oh, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:It It I mean, it's just such a surprise.
LEADFEMALE:Well, honey, we didn't mean to leave you out, but it all happened so quickly with Cathy and me.
SUPMALE:There just wasn't time.
SUPMALE:How did it happen? Well, for six months, I was just another woodwind.
SUPMALE:Then we, uh, both started to realize how perfect we are for each other.
LEADFEMALE:So it's not as if we're strangers.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm really happy for you.
LEADMALE:It's, uh It just caught me unprepared.
LEADMALE:I mean, I didn't even get a chance to buy you a present.
OTHERMALE:Honey, if you're happy for us, that's the best present we could get.
LEADFEMALE:So, what do you do in the orchestra? Oh, I play the flute.
LEADMALE:Well, if you got it, flout it.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I feel like a million dollars.
LEADMALE:I've got a great job and a terrific wife and a beautiful daughter.
LEADMALE:Lovable me.
SUPFEMALE:The cloud around my silver lining.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, I hope you and Mork will think of Cathy as part of the family.
LEADFEMALE:( Italian accent ) Oh, mama.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, che faccia.
LEADMALE:Che dita.
LEADMALE:Che ballard.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mind, now that I have a mom, I can do all those wonderful things.
LEADFEMALE:You can cut my meat and take me to the barbershop, and you can buy me little shirts and socks and things.
LEADMALE:Mork! No, that's okay.
LEADMALE:Mind, now we have a real mom.
LEADFEMALE:A new stepmother.
SUPMALE:What's the difference, Mind? It just means Cathy's not Mindy's biological mother.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I guess I'm a replacement.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, like sizzlean.
SUPMALE:Cathy and I are honeymooning in Acapulco, but we wanted to stop here for a few days so you two could get to know each other.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:So other than getting married, what have you been doing? Well, I've been keeping your grandmother out of trouble.
LEADFEMALE:That is not easy, she has a crush on the entire string section.
LEADMALE:Oh, sex and violins.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how is the orchestra biz? Oh, great, great.
OTHERMALE:And I'm getting rave reviews on my interpretation of the BolÃ©ro.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, if it's Ravel, it's swell.
OTHERFEMALE:So, what do you two have planned while you're in Boulder? Uh, well, uh, the first thing I would like to do is see the house.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, yes.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad it hasn't sold yet.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, we're thinking of moving back here for good.
SUPFEMALE:That way, you and Cathy could be like a real mother and daughter.
LEADMALE:That's great.
LEADMALE:It's, um, terrific.
SUPFEMALE:Um, why don't we all have dinner? Din-din.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Din-din.
LEADMALE:Mind, I'm gonna sit next to Mom, if you don't mind.
SUPMALE:You don't mind if I call you "Mom," do you? No, no.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay.
LEADMALE:Just don't ask me to push you around in a shopping cart.
SUPFEMALE:"Shopping cart.
LEADMALE:" Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar! Uh, Mom, what are the chances of my getting a baby brother? ( knock on door ) Come on in.
LEADFEMALE:It's okay.
SUPMALE:You all right? Yeah, I just thought I'd come in here and think a little.
SUPFEMALE:I'm too excited to sleep, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:It's not every day an orphan gets a mother.
LEADFEMALE:A stepmother, Mork.
LEADMALE:A real mother's the first one you ever have.
LEADMALE:Cathy is the first mother I've ever had.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I've been looking through all your gift catalogues.
OTHERMALE:Frederick's and Spiegel, trying to find a wedding present for him.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm sure you'll find something nice.
SUPMALE:Can't be just nice, Mind, it's got to be super-nice.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it's for our folks.
SUPMALE:Well, good luck.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll talk to you in the morning.
LEADMALE:You know, I want to get something for the both of them.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe a negligee built for two.
LEADMALE:They'll like that.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
SUPMALE:I'm so happy, Mind, I want to buy a box of cigars, that says, "It's a Mom.
SUPFEMALE:" Good night.
OTHERFEMALE:Or maybe I'll buy them a wire-haired terrier.
LEADMALE:It's a great pet and besides, they do the dishes with it.
OTHERFEMALE:( imitates dog barking ) Mind? Mork? Good night.
SUPMALE:Daddy, I'm hungry.
LEADMALE:I want waffles.
LEADMALE:Good morning, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go fix you some.
LEADMALE:Mommy makes them better.
SUPFEMALE:Honey come on over here and sit down next to Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:Now, Mindy you know how Mommy's been sick, and And how she hasn't always been able to play with you? Well the angels felt bad that Mommy was sick, so They came and they took her to a place where she won't have to feel sick ever again.
LEADMALE:When they bring Mommy back, tell her I want waffles for breakfast and some for Mr.
LEADMALE:One Eye.
SUPMALE:Mommy can't make you waffles.
SUPMALE:She's in heaven.
SUPMALE:I'm waiting in Mommy's chair until they bring her back.
LEADMALE:Why don't you call the angels and tell them I'm hungry? Sweetheart ( sighs ) I know this isn't easy, but you have to understand.
SUPMALE:Mommy isn't coming back.
SUPMALE:It'll be all right.
SUPFEMALE:I'll go fix you some waffles and some for Mr.
LEADMALE:One Eye.
SUPFEMALE:I want my mother.
OTHERFEMALE:I want my mother! ( crying ) I want my mommy! I want my mommy! I want my mommy! I want my mommy.
LEADMALE:( crying ) I want my mommy.
LEADFEMALE:I want my mommy! I want my mommy! Mind? I want my mommy! Oh! Oh, Mork! ( Sobbing ) Mind, it's all right.
SUPFEMALE:Shh.
SUPMALE:It's all right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm here.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm here.
LEADMALE:Shh, shh.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, it was just awful.
LEADMALE:I remember exactly how I felt the day my mother died.
LEADMALE:Mind, that was a long time ago.
SUPMALE:Now you have a perfectly good mom just waiting to be used.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I don't understand why you're not happy.
SUPFEMALE:I want to be happy.
LEADMALE:I am.
LEADMALE:I'm happy for my father.
SUPFEMALE:But it just seems awkward to have somebody walk into your life and say, "Well, here's your new mom, just as good as the old one.
LEADMALE:" I don't think your father was saying Cathy could take your mom's place.
LEADFEMALE:I think your father has a need for someone in his life, and he wants you to like her.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just being stupid.
SUPFEMALE:You don't have to be an idiot to see what this is all about.
SUPFEMALE:What's this all about, Mind? Well, they say sometimes, when a father remarries, that the daughter feels threatened by the other woman.
LEADFEMALE:Why, 'cause she's wearing exploding underwear? Fruit of the boom? Not that kind of threatened.
SUPMALE:It's more like being afraid that the other woman is gonna take your father's love away from you.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Is this jealousy, Mind? Well, I guess I am a little jealous.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you told me once, though, that earthlings can love more than one person.
SUPMALE:Like, when I came into your life, you said that you didn't stop loving your father any less.
SUPMALE:Well, that's because you didn't marry my father.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I am a little jealous, but not enough to make me feel this bad.
LEADMALE:I don't know what I feel.
OTHERFEMALE:( sighs ) Maybe you should have a talk with your father man to Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I think you're right, and the sooner, the better.
LEADFEMALE:Now that I have a mom, I can do all those kid things I never got to do, like grow a milk mustache, stay up late at night and read comic books under the covers with a flashlight, go for long rides in the car and say, ( high-pitched voice ) "Are we there yet? Why did the Arabs raise the price of oil, Dad?" Falling down and skinning your knee and having somebody tell you there's no such thing as the tooth fairy.
SUPFEMALE:Mork and Cathy really seem to be hitting it off, don't they? Yeah, a little better than you and Cathy are doing.
LEADMALE:Actually, I'm kind of glad they're not here right now 'cause I'd like to talk about this.
SUPMALE:I'd really like to.
LEADFEMALE:You seem to be having some problems with the situation.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I am.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, why didn't you tell me you were getting married? Well, honey, I I There were so many arrangements, and we were so busy, and You could've called.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you're right.
LEADMALE:I could have.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I just wish that I had been given a little time.
LEADFEMALE:Everything was just sort of thrown at me.
SUPMALE:To tell you the truth, Dad, it was kind of like you'd completely forgotten about Mom, like she never existed.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey I'll never forget your mother.
SUPFEMALE:She was the first woman I ever loved.
OTHERFEMALE:( sighs ) I remember I remember the way her hair smelled, her laugh, her voice.
SUPFEMALE:Every detail about her is burned into my memory.
SUPFEMALE:I remember she used to grind her teeth in her sleep, and it drove me crazy.
LEADMALE:After she was gone, I missed that sound so much.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dad, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Honey never think I've forgotten your mother.
LEADMALE:But I also never forgot what it was like to to be a husband, and And that's what I can have again with Cathy.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:Look at the two of us.
LEADMALE:This should be one of the happiest days of your life, and we're acting like it's a funeral.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Come on, let's get this Let's get this place cleaned up.
LEADFEMALE:And I promise that I'll try not to act like a jerk.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, if I could only hear those words from Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, you like him, and you know it.
LEADMALE:Yes, unfortunately.
SUPMALE:Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de ho.
LEADFEMALE:FRED: Where's Cathy? She's outside parking the car.
LEADFEMALE:You know, pops, I really approve of your choice.
SUPMALE:We're three lucky people.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Mork, you shouldn't have jumped out until I stopped the car.
LEADFEMALE:I was just in a hurry to report.
SUPFEMALE:Where have you been? I was giving her a cultural tour of Boulder.
SUPFEMALE:I took her to a theater in the mall.
OTHERFEMALE:There's no theater in the mall.
LEADFEMALE:It's a little theater.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, it was a puppet show.
LEADMALE:They're doing Shakespeare's "Punch and Hamlet.
SUPMALE:" ( high-pitched voice ) "To be or not to be, "That is the question.
LEADFEMALE:You call that a question? Whoa!" ( normal voice ) After that, we went to see an art film.
LEADFEMALE:War of the Worlds.
LEADMALE:I meant to ask you, why were you rooting for the Martians? Well, they're a much-maligned people.
SUPMALE:Well, I told you he's a little eccentric.
LEADMALE:We went to the delicatessen.
LEADFEMALE:Remo and Jeanie didn't believe that she was my mom.
LEADMALE:What'd you do? Mom just laughed.
LEADMALE:"Ar, ar, ar.
LEADFEMALE:" That's what got us these free desserts, see? Ah, cannoli.
OTHERFEMALE:I saw them, I just couldn't resist.
LEADMALE:My favorite dessert.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, mine too.
LEADFEMALE:My favorite is spaghetti Ã  la mode.
SUPFEMALE:Mork's on the Weight Watchers hit list.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Don't sit there.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Um it's just that that was my mother's chair.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I I'm sorry, I No, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:I I'm sorry, I Um I really apologize.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, um FRED: Mindy No, no, no, no.
SUPMALE:I just have to work a few things out, that's all.
OTHERMALE:I I I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Mind? I think she just signaled for help.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, at first I thought it was just that I was angry because I thought my father had forgotten about my mother.
LEADFEMALE:But he hasn't.
SUPMALE:He just wants a chance for a little happiness himself.
LEADMALE:I just don't understand why I keep getting in the way of that.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we've examined all the earthly reasons.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we should try a little Orkan psychology.
SUPMALE:I didn't know Orkans used psychology.
LEADFEMALE:Well, normally, we like to use peanut brittle, but this calls for drastic measures.
LEADFEMALE:Stretch out on the couch.
LEADFEMALE:On Ork, you lie on couches too? No, we usually have them strapped to our back.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna start off with a little free association.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:When I say "night" I say "day.
SUPFEMALE:" I say "Black" "White.
LEADMALE:" "Red.
OTHERFEMALE:" "Yellow.
LEADMALE:" Wrong! ( Laughs ) That's one for me.
LEADFEMALE:( Chuckles ) Now, Mind, we continue on.
LEADMALE:Tell me everything you remember about your mother.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that could take hours.
LEADFEMALE:Give me something more specific.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, uncooperative patient.
SUPMALE:Well, what did your mother look like? Okay, let's see.
OTHERMALE:Her hair was brown.
LEADMALE:That's a safe bet, Mind.
SUPMALE:And she was tall.
LEADMALE:How tall? Taller than a tabletop.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, a furniture fixation.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:And her eyes were blue like mine.
SUPFEMALE:Mm-hm.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see.
SUPFEMALE:What else? Patient can't remember what mother looks like.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not so crazy about your Orkan psychology.
LEADMALE:Oh, lucky you.
LEADMALE:It's almost over.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, Mind, what do you remember most about your mother? Well, I guess the thing I remember most is the terrible pain I felt when I finally realized that she was never coming back.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe that's why you're afraid to test-drive a new mother.
LEADFEMALE:You think that could be it? See, when I was a little boy, I had this electric chicken, and I tried to pet it with wet hands.
SUPMALE:It shocked the shazbat out of me, and I never wanted to do that again.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, there's a big difference between electric chickens and mothers.
OTHERMALE:No, I don't think so, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:We both got burned.
LEADMALE:I guess you could be right.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I don't want another mother if she's gonna be taken away from me.
LEADFEMALE:See, I never had a mom, Mind, and I'm sure not gonna blow my chance now, even if I have to give her up one day.
SUPFEMALE:It's gonna take some getting used to.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, but you and Cathy have a lot of time.
LEADMALE:Yes, we do.
SUPFEMALE:You know, there is one thing I remember about my mother.
OTHERMALE:Whenever I had a problem or I hurt, she'd always put her arms around me, and that would always make everything just fine.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's real nice.
LEADFEMALE:You never had anything like that, did you? It's kind of hard to cry on a test tube's shoulder.
LEADFEMALE:Most of the time, you'd go, and you'd slide down.
LEADMALE:( knock on door ) Oh, come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADFEMALE:Um, we just stopped by for a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:We're on our way to the airport.
LEADFEMALE:But I thought you were gonna stay for a couple of days.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, we were, but I decided I couldn't wait to get down to Acapulco and soak up that sunshine and those margaritas.
OTHERMALE:Yes, actually Uh, the fact is, I feel that I've disrupted something here, and maybe it's best if Fred and I leave just a little earlier.
LEADFEMALE:It hasn't been you.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been the one disrupting things.
LEADMALE:No, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, it's been my fault.
SUPMALE:It's the old electric-chicken syndrome.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, maybe part of the problem is that you're feeling pressured to accept me as your mother.
OTHERMALE:But Mindy should feel that you're a part of No, Fred, I'm not her mother.
SUPMALE:Maybe it'll be easier for you if you just think of me as a friend.
SUPMALE:I'll try.
SUPMALE:If you're lucky, you can be both.
LEADFEMALE:A friend and mother.
LEADFEMALE:A "frother.
LEADFEMALE:" Cathy, I just want you to know that I'm really looking forward to the next time you and Dad are in town.
LEADMALE:And if you do decide to move into the old house, I know I'll be real happy to have a whole family here again.
SUPFEMALE:Oh Thank you, honey.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Cathy I hope you can forgive me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, just like a real mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Mom, before you go, can we talk about an allowance? Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:ORSON: Hello, Mork.
SUPMALE:Has it been a good week? A very interesting week, relatively speaking.
LEADMALE:And speaking of relatives, Mindy and I have a new one.
OTHERFEMALE:What's "relative"? Everything, according to Einstein, but stay tuned and turn up your volume because here comes the straight poop right at you.
LEADMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:There's been a wedding in the family and Mindy's father came home with a new wife.
LEADMALE:It kind of caused problems for Mind.
SUPMALE:She didn't like having a new mother? No, she didn't like having a replacement for the old one.
LEADFEMALE:You see, humans become very attached to their loved ones.
LEADFEMALE:And when they're gone, I think they cling to the memories.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like earthlings place great value on their past.
LEADMALE:It's very true, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Memories are untouchable, and humans have a need to be touched.
LEADMALE:But the nice thing is, sir, that sometimes you can have one without giving up the other.
LEADMALE:On that high moral note, mein Hindenburg, nanu, nanu.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu.
SUPMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( mellow theme playing ) I suppose you're wondering why I called this lunch.
SUPMALE:Well, let me guess.
SUPMALE:Eh, you're hungry.
LEADMALE:Mindy, lunches aren't for eating.
LEADMALE:They're for deducting.
OTHERMALE:We're here to discuss my campaign.
SUPMALE:Nelson, do you really think you can get elected to city council? Heh, why ask me? Let's consult the vox populi.
OTHERMALE:Uh, excuse me, sir.
LEADMALE:Huh? Do you know who I am? No.
SUPFEMALE:Who are you? See, there's a natural curiosity about me.
LEADFEMALE:( cheerful music playing in the distance) MORK ( on bullhorn): Say it, win with Flavor.
SUPMALE:Say it with me now.
OTHERMALE:Win the Flavor.
LEADMALE:Yes, we'll hear from the old man himself.
LEADFEMALE:Win with Flavor.
OTHERFEMALE:Say it with me now.
LEADFEMALE:There's a parade for you? My gosh, it's starting, Flavormania.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
SUPMALE:What's with all the noise? What noise? Will you cut the tape recorder off? People are trying to eat.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:( music stops ) ( loud feedback ) Excuse me, sir.
SUPFEMALE:It will be okay as soon as I hose it off.
SUPFEMALE:Uh I'll get you, Ill get you a new one.
LEADFEMALE:Make it a cheeseburger.
LEADFEMALE:Give me that.
LEADFEMALE:( honking ) A one-man parade.
LEADMALE:I think I have a goosebump.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's a privilege campaigning for you, Flavorship.
LEADMALE:You know, I've been knocking on doors, peeking in windows, kissing mothers, shaking babies.
SUPFEMALE:It's wonderful.
LEADMALE:I've been gathering the grass roots and distributing them, and the young people are going, "Wow, this flavor.
LEADMALE:It's really nice.
SUPMALE:" What did you do with my posters? Well, the whole posters didn't fit into my parade concept, They are little pieces, I just Yeheh, heh.
LEADFEMALE:Eh, but don't worry, they're all numbered here and here's a part that only a mother could love.
SUPFEMALE:( chuckles ) NELSON: Oh, what's the use.
LEADFEMALE:No one knows who I am.
LEADFEMALE:Well, look at the bright side, you can make a total fool out of yourself, and no one would care, heh, heh.
LEADMALE:I mean, you could go on national television and go, "My fellow Americans, I'd like to show you the dancing weasle.
LEADMALE:" ( chuckles ) What I need, are organized groups of people to support me.
SUPMALE:Don't look at me.
LEADFEMALE:What can I do? I knew I could get you to go there for me tonight.
LEADMALE:Go where? Mindy, tonight I'm supposed speak at the gathering of the International Ladies Garment Workers.
SUPMALE:Oh, are you gonna take a peak at their union label, huh? Argh.
OTHERMALE:( chuckles ) I'd do anything to win those women over Even listen to them sing.
LEADFEMALE:But at the same time, there's a meeting for the Committee to Clean Up Boulder.
LEADMALE:I think it's some new conservation group.
OTHERMALE:I want you to go there and let them know that I deeply care about whatever it is they stand for.
OTHERMALE:Nelson, I'd love to help you out, but tonight I've got a student-teaching seminar, and it's real important to me, I've gotta go.
SUPMALE:Shame, I can't find anyone to go tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Whoo.
SUPFEMALE:Whoo.
LEADFEMALE:I think you found a volunteer.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I'll appoint you.
LEADMALE:But remember, you're going as my representative.
LEADMALE:So remember, don't do anything that I wouldn't do.
SUPMALE:Would you do this? Nee-ee, ee, prrrr, whoo, whoo, na, na, prr.
LEADFEMALE:Ha ha.
SUPMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Pity.
LEADFEMALE:( mellow theme playing ) Hi, there, concerned voter.
LEADFEMALE:Put her there.
LEADMALE:I don't think I know you.
LEADMALE:Oh, of course you do, I just said, Hi, there, concerned voter, put her there.
OTHERFEMALE:I represent Nelson Flavor.
SUPFEMALE:It's an honor I don't take lightly.
LEADMALE:Eh Are you sure you're in the right place? Eh, indeed, I am, sir.
SUPMALE:Keep Boulder Clean, that's our motto.
SUPFEMALE:It's our noble aim, and Nelson's one of the cleanest.
OTHERMALE:People come from miles around just to sniff him.
OTHERFEMALE:He is so clean that he makes Debby Boone look like a sweat hog.
LEADMALE:Stick with us.
LEADFEMALE:Nice chatting with you.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, there.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, oh sorry.
SUPFEMALE:( giggles ) You know, Nelson's for purity.
SUPFEMALE:I think it's an idea whose time has come.
SUPFEMALE:What do you think? I like where you're coming from.
LEADFEMALE:I like where you've been.
LEADMALE:Heh, aargh.
LEADMALE:You're, uh, new here, aren't you? You know, that's an interesting concept.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's talk about that.
OTHERMALE:Let's rap.
OTHERMALE:Let's share energy.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome to our meeting.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Jim Blake.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm Mork Blank.
OTHERFEMALE:I represent Nelson Flavor.
SUPMALE:Nelson Fl Who's he? He's a concerned politician as you can see right here who thinks that Boulder should be cleaned up, whichever which way you want.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, uh, Jim.
LEADFEMALE:( clears throat ) Excuse me, fella.
SUPFEMALE:How interesting Yeah, what is it? I don't now about this guy.
LEADMALE:Leave him to me, Prescott.

LEADMALE:Flavor.
LEADMALE:Good American name.
SUPFEMALE:Tell me, what does he think of the race problem? He believes that he should be ahead of everybody else.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's what we believe, right? Yes, yes.
SUPMALE:You see, we're a white bread group, and we think there's too much rye and pumpernickel in the world.
SUPMALE:Then you'll like Nelson.
SUPFEMALE:He's well-bred, and he's no crumb.
LEADMALE:Heh, a-argh.
SUPMALE:Ha-hah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, tell me.
OTHERMALE:When can we meet this friend of yours? How soon can you spit? Say, tomorrow morning at my place? Sounds good.
LEADFEMALE:I think our meeting's about to start now.
LEADFEMALE:If you'd like to, eh, stick around.
LEADMALE:Hey, quick.
LEADFEMALE:You pick up quick.
LEADFEMALE:If you'd like to stick around, we'll give you our beginning indoctrination.

LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
SUPMALE:Oh.

SUPFEMALE:It's nice to see young people dressing up again.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) ( mellow theme playing ) And to think they're all coming all the way over here just to meet me.
LEADMALE:May I have a tissue? I haven't been this deeply touched since the Walton's Thanksgiving special.
SUPMALE:You know, Mork, you really haven't told us much about what went on at that meeting last night.
LEADMALE:What's there to say? They're a swell bunch of people who have some ideas about how to get the trash out of Boulder.
OTHERMALE:Well, that's good.
LEADMALE:I'm really glad that you met some new people.
SUPMALE:I think I'm a better person having known them.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Color me giddy.
SUPMALE:It's moments like these that make the struggle, the sacrifice, and the sucking up worthwhile.
LEADFEMALE:( doorbell rings ) Oh, that's my friends.

OTHERFEMALE:That's our slogan.
LEADFEMALE:Catchy.

LEADMALE:Back at you.
LEADFEMALE:( Blake laughs ) PRESCOTT: Hey, talk is cheap.
SUPMALE:How do we know you're different than any other politician? Well, if I don't know, how would you? Nelson's very concerned with protecting the environment.
OTHERFEMALE:So what? Am I wrong, or did I just lose some brownie points? Don't worry about it.
SUPMALE:It's time for the selling of Flavor.

SUPMALE:( applause ) ( chukling ): Well, you've certainly got a staunch supporter there, Flavor.
LEADMALE:Yes, and I think Nelson and your group would work real well together.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, from what Mork says, we certainly are on the same wavelength.
LEADMALE:I can't wait till you teach him what you taught me.
SUPFEMALE:This town really needs some cleaning up.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm your man.
LEADMALE:He's okay with me, Jim.
LEADMALE:Well, I like where he's coming from, heh.
LEADMALE:Now exactly how would you like me to help you clean up Boulder? Well, first, I think we ought to start with the spics.
SUPFEMALE:( blow out coffee ) The what? Heh.
SUPMALE:The taco benders.
LEADFEMALE:BLAKE: Now, we know, we know there aren't too many of them living here right now, but we want them out.
LEADFEMALE:Boulder's for Americans.
LEADFEMALE:Then I think we got to go after the nips, gooks, and bagel breath.
LEADMALE:I don't believe this.
SUPFEMALE:Then we can smear the krauts, Polacks, beaners, and jungle bunnies, heh.
LEADMALE:Somehow, I was thinking more in terms of better water quality.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know what these so-called Americans taught you, Mork, but I think it's ugly and disgusting.
LEADMALE:It just so happens that Nelson and I are both part Polish.
SUPFEMALE:( blow out coffee ) Polish, Mind? That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Our grandmother came all the way to this country from Warsaw.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Har-de-har-harski.
SUPFEMALE:( laughs ) Is this true, Flavor? Not necessarily.
LEADFEMALE:Of course it's true.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I think you all had better leave.
LEADMALE:We'll be glad to leave.
SUPFEMALE:Let's get out of this pigsty.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:( dramatic theme playing ) Come on, Mind.
LEADMALE:Don't be so rough on my friends.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if they're your friends, Mork, why don't you just leave with them? Mm, all right.
LEADFEMALE:While I'm out, I'll pick you up a Polish six-pack four beers.
LEADMALE:Aargh.
LEADFEMALE:Mork's turned into a bigot.
LEADFEMALE:( mellow theme playing ) And then before I knew it, I threw him out.
LEADMALE:Tsk, doesn't sound like the Mork that I know.
LEADMALE:Oh, Jeanie, Mork is so impressionable.
LEADFEMALE:And these people really know how to poison your mind.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't know there were any hate groups in Boulder.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't either.
SUPFEMALE:Hard to see 'em, but they're there.
SUPMALE:They hide behind the flag.
LEADMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:Poor Nelson, I wish you could have seen him.
LEADMALE:He was so humiliated when he found out he was about to support that group.
SUPFEMALE:( chuckles ) So you're Polish, huh? Should have known with a last name like McConnell.
SUPFEMALE:My grandmother was Polish, Remo.
LEADFEMALE:Why do people make fun of the Polish? Probably for the same reason they make fun of other ethnic groups.
LEADFEMALE:It's easier to put down someone who's different than to try to understand him.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but it's sort of a shame.
SUPFEMALE:You got to admit, some of those Polish jokes are funny.
OTHERFEMALE:Like, I heard one about this priest, this minister, and this cabbage smuggler Remo.
LEADMALE:Uh, come on, Remo.
SUPMALE:I think we should make ourselves scarce.
LEADFEMALE:Dobre, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I brought you a little gift.
LEADFEMALE:Something special.
LEADMALE:It's just for you.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:A light bulb? Yeah, I wanna see how many relatives it would take to screw it in, heh.
OTHERMALE:( chuckles ) Or the one about the Polish man who locked his keys in his car, took him two weeks to get his family out.
OTHERMALE:( chuckles ) Or or these two Polish duck hunters.
LEADFEMALE:One says,"Stach, how come we're not getting any birds?" He said, "maybe we're not throwing the dog high enough.
LEADMALE:" That's enough.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, all right.
LEADFEMALE:I'll change the subject, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you know what's wrong with Ireland geographically? It's above sea level, heh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you know why Greeks don't have freckles? 'Cause they keep sliding off.
LEADFEMALE:That is enough.
SUPFEMALE:What's wrong, Mind? I mean, these are funny.
OTHERFEMALE:Mindy, are you okay? No.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey, hey, look.
SUPMALE:What's goin' on here? Remo, you know what my friends say about Italians eating Chinese food? They use wop sticks.
LEADMALE:REMO: Hey Here's one, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:You know how to save a darkie from drowning? No, Mork.
LEADMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, shut up.
SUPFEMALE:What's wrong, Mind? I mean, my friends laugh at these.
SUPMALE:Do you see anyone here laughing? I almost did at the one about the dog, because Sit down, Mork.
SUPMALE:You and I have to talk, right now.
LEADMALE:Mork, do you know what bigotry is? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Bigotry, that's what they have in Italian forests, "bigga tree.
LEADMALE:" ( chuckles ) ( laughs ) No.
LEADMALE:Bigotry is when people hate other people just because they're different.
SUPFEMALE:I don't hate anybody, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:My, my friends just laugh at them because they say they're inferior.
SUPMALE:Mork, I don't know about where you came from, but here on Earth, we're all supposed to be created equal.
LEADFEMALE:The only people who are inferior are those who say that other people are.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but my friends tell me that Your friend could fertilize Iowa with their mouths.
LEADMALE:And they're, they're a bunch of sick, stupid creeps who could do a lot of harm.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, they're just telling jokes, heh.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, they use those jokes as weapons until they have enough guts to buy bullets.
SUPFEMALE:I wouldn't be surprised if 40 years ago in Germany somedy said, "Did you hear the one about the two Jews?" Before long, that's almost all that we're left.
LEADMALE:I guess you're right.
LEADFEMALE:That's not funny.
SUPFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:Well there's one thing that confuses me, though, Mind.
LEADMALE:Aren't there any people on Earth who are lazy, shiftless, pushy, dumb, and inscrutable? Well, of course there are, but, but in every race, creed, and color.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, aren't there people like that on Ork? Not anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:They sent me here.
LEADFEMALE:You know what? I didn't mean to hurt anybody, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:II just wanted to tell a few jokes.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Tsk, oh, I know you are, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you think there are a few people around here you should apologize to? Yeah everybody, heh.
LEADFEMALE:( mellow theme playing ) Thanks for taking me to the movie, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you Polish people sure are generous.
OTHERFEMALE:( chuckles ) Oh, Mork, look.
SUPMALE:Everything is ruined.
OTHERMALE:Maybe we've been robbed, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:No, I don't th There's the stereo and the TV.
SUPMALE:Oh, look at my dishes.
LEADFEMALE:And my plants.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:They've snuffed fern.
LEADFEMALE:My dad bought me this when I moved in here.
LEADMALE:( sobbing ): Oh, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:It's all right, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:You can sleep on your side for a while.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder if they did anything to the attic.
LEADFEMALE:Let me check.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:( ominous theme playing ) Oh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:I'm scared.
SUPFEMALE:MORK: Okay It's all right, Mind, You just stay here.
LEADFEMALE:You lock the door, and I'll be right back.
SUPMALE:Where are you gonna go? Got a little score to settle with the friends.
SUPMALE:( ominous theme playing ) You want pure power? I'll show you pure power.
LEADFEMALE:Oooo.
LEADFEMALE:Eeeeeee.
LEADFEMALE:Eeeee.
LEADFEMALE:Ooooo.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooooo.
OTHERMALE:( cheerful theme playing ) Mmmmmmmm.
SUPMALE:Eeeeeee.
SUPFEMALE:Ooo.
LEADMALE:Eeeeeee.
SUPFEMALE:Ooo.
LEADFEMALE:Ooo.
LEADFEMALE:Ooo.
LEADFEMALE:Ooo.
LEADMALE:Pfffffft.
SUPFEMALE:Oooooo.
LEADMALE:Oooooo.
SUPMALE:Oooooo.
OTHERFEMALE:Oooooo.
LEADFEMALE:Oooooo.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooooo.
LEADFEMALE:Eeeeee.
SUPMALE:That's what I think of your little group.
LEADFEMALE:MINDY: Mork.
OTHERMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, Mork, what have you done? Oh, Mork, violence just leads to more violence.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah I think I've done the wrong thing.
LEADFEMALE:I'm becoming like them.
SUPFEMALE:This is how wars get started, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:We can't fight hate with hate.
LEADMALE:We're just not good at it.
LEADFEMALE:What's the answer? Oh, I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:I wish I did.
OTHERFEMALE:I was taught to fight hate with love and understanding.
LEADFEMALE:That's good odds.
LEADFEMALE:It's two against one.
LEADMALE:( sighs ) ( gasps ) What the hell are you doing? Makin' a mess, heh, heh.
SUPMALE:Well, we're gonna make a mess out of you and the Polack.
LEADMALE:Oh, I guess this is a job for love, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, hon, would you look at this? This is so unkempt, ha, ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:I know, you, you must be tired after a hard day of hating various and sundry ethnic groups, so why don't you just sit down.
LEADMALE:I'll get your pipe, slippers, and kerosene.
SUPMALE:( chuckles ) All right, Prescott.
SUPMALE:Let's get him.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, I don't think love worked.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe we better try a little understanding.
LEADMALE:Ooooo.
OTHERMALE:I feel strange.
SUPFEMALE:Me too.
LEADMALE:MINDY: Ah, look, Blake is black.
SUPMALE:Oo-oo.
OTHERFEMALE:What happened? Well, I just kind of reprogrammed their genes.
LEADMALE:Mork, are they gonna stay this way? Oh, only until they learn about brotherhood without the hood.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye, everybody.
LEADMALE:Welcome to America.
LEADFEMALE:( mellow theme playing ) Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, nicest person in the history of the universe.
LEADFEMALE:ORSON: Mork? Sir? I'm surprised.
SUPMALE:You usually greet me with some slur about my size.
SUPMALE:Oh, not anymore, oh, wonderful being.
LEADMALE:I've learned that slurs can be harmful.
LEADMALE:Actually, I've sort of gotten used to your remarks.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I'm glad to hear that, your porky pigness, heh.
SUPMALE:I just want to say that f-f-f-f forget it.
LEADMALE:Your report, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, sir.
SUPFEMALE:This week, sir, a group of people taught me about a new emotion called hate.
SUPFEMALE:Is hate anything like love? Well, sir, let's just say they use the sheets for different purposes.
LEADMALE:Or as one poet says, "Love builds bridges between people.
SUPFEMALE:Hate binds them up.
SUPMALE:" Why does this group you mentioned teach hate? Well, sir, there are certain people here on Earth who can only feel up by putting other people down.
LEADMALE:For example, when we call someone ambitious, they call them pushy.
LEADFEMALE:When we call someone carefree, they call them lazy bum.
LEADMALE:When we call someone different, they call them hippie freak.
SUPFEMALE:When they call someone inscrutable, we say, "What's that?" It seems to me that hate affects vision and distorts what people see.
SUPMALE:Oh, it does, sir.
SUPMALE:I wish they could make a contact lens for the mind so that these people would see that when you mix all different varieties of earthlings together, you get this incredible human rainbow that stems from the same source, and each person has his own pot of gold.
LEADFEMALE:Till next week, sir, nanu sayonara shalom dosvedanya ciao lon sauri, heh.
LEADMALE:From all of us here on this wonderful little planet saying, heh, "catch you later.
OTHERFEMALE:"
SUPFEMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu! ( upbeat theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Okay, Mork, I'm ready to go.
LEADFEMALE:( harmonica being played ) Mork? Mork.
LEADMALE:( in low voice ): Shut the box.
SUPMALE:What are you doing in there? I was just sitting in here because it reminds me of the house I used to have on Ork.
SUPFEMALE:I had a condominium.
OTHERFEMALE:And this is a lot bigger, actually.
OTHERMALE:We were gonna go hiking, remember? Oh, Mindy, I'm not in the mood.
SUPMALE:I'm thinking, my planet's so far away.
LEADMALE:I can't even Oh, it's out there.
SUPFEMALE:It sounds like you're homesick.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it's worse.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Orksick.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Orson promised me a vacation, then he said I couldn't go.
SUPMALE:He said there was a story about the eggs being grounded because of cracks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mindy.
SUPMALE:( cries ): Mindy, no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's not fair! Oh! Aw, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:I'm I'm sure Orson will give you another vacation real soon.
LEADFEMALE:Ha! A lot you know.
OTHERMALE:I'll never be able to skip through the fields of aluminum again picking little Tupperware buds.
LEADFEMALE:And look up at those 18 moons.
LEADMALE:Ork has 18 moons? Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:That's why all of our coyotes have laryngitis.
LEADFEMALE:It's real strange.
LEADFEMALE:You'll see them at night going: ( Croaks ) Oh, you are depressed, aren't you? Well, I'll fix that.
OTHERMALE:Here, raise your left arm.
LEADMALE:Now, raise your right arm.
OTHERMALE:( giggles ) That was wildly creative, Mindy, but it hardly lightens the load.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Life can be beautiful anywhere if you just give it the chance.
LEADMALE:Mindy, stop looking at the world through WASP-colored glasses.
LEADMALE:Don't you understand? I got a right to sing the blues.
LEADFEMALE:Five, six, seven ( plays harmonica ) Oh, I wander Throughout the universe It just seems To make it worse I can't get it Off my mind I ain't had a close encounter Of any kind ( plays ) Oh, nanus is good news That's why I'm singin' These Orkan blues ( plays ) ( knock at door ) MORK: Probably an agent with a recording contract.
LEADMALE:Oh, hello, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Bickley.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry about the noise.
LEADFEMALE:Noise? You mean the music? I danced all the way upstairs just filled with joy at being in the same building with musical Mork and perky little Mindy with the tweakable nose.
LEADMALE:Got your nose.
LEADMALE:La-la-la I have been truly blessed.
LEADMALE:Ta-ta.
LEADFEMALE:What's that? Did you say I forgot something, mayhaps? Now, what could it be? Ah, yes.
SUPFEMALE:I would like both of you to come down to my apartment this evening to meet my son.
LEADMALE:Your son? I didn't know you had a son.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I've done it all at least once.
OTHERFEMALE:Tom is a wonderful boy, and he's about your age.
LEADMALE:And I'm sure you'll have a lot in common.
LEADFEMALE:Seven-thirty? Sure.
LEADMALE:We'd love to meet him.
LEADFEMALE:I just knew you loved kids.
LEADFEMALE:Here's your nose back.
OTHERFEMALE:La-la-la Do you believe it? See? Bickley actually does have a nice side.
LEADMALE:I knew that if we waited long enough that eventually it would have to surface.
LEADFEMALE:But won't that be interesting to meet his son? I can't go, Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:I I have a date with self-pity.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Look, a lot A lot of times, a good way to get your mind off of your troubles is to do something nice for somebody else.
OTHERFEMALE:Like what? Tonight we'll go down to Bickley's, and you'll be nice to his son.
SUPMALE:And in the meantime you can take me hiking like you promised.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:I I don't want to ruin your day.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take you hiking but I don't want to leave the apartment.
LEADMALE:So you You just walk in place.
SUPFEMALE:Walk in place.
LEADMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:You walk in place.
LEADMALE:Here comes a quaking aspen.
LEADMALE:Oh, no! Mork Oh, keep walking.
OTHERMALE:Keep walking.
LEADFEMALE:A tap-dancing sequoia.
SUPFEMALE:( laughs ) Here comes a little bunny.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, a truck.
LEADMALE:Pfft! ( upbeat theme playing ) ( knocking ) Come in.
LEADFEMALE:It's open.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? Oh, hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Why are you sitting in the dark? I'm sorry.

LEADMALE:Your father didn't tell us that I mean, uh, your father didn't He didn't say that I was blind? No.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, Dad's not the kind of fellow that likes to brag.
LEADMALE:Mindy, what does "blind" mean? It means that he can't see.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I I was just testing.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll have to excuse Mork.
LEADMALE:He's never seen a blind person before.
LEADFEMALE:Neither have I.
LEADMALE:What's the dog for? She's special.
LEADFEMALE:She really is.
SUPFEMALE:She She leads me around and she helps me find my shoes.
LEADFEMALE:Most of the time, though, she just keeps me from making a fool out of myself.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I have Mindy for.
SUPMALE:( Tom laughs ) So is your father here? Mindy, show some sensitivity.
LEADMALE:How would he know? No, no.
OTHERMALE:Dad called and said he'd be a little late, but that his best friends, Mork and Mindy, would keep me company.
SUPFEMALE:Does "best" mean "only"? Ar! Um So how'd you get into the apartment? Oh, Dad left a key for me.
OTHERMALE:Hidden in the lock.
LEADMALE:He's going to meet me later at the Purple Grotto Club.
LEADMALE:I'm performing there.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're a performer.
LEADMALE:( imitating Ed Sullivan ): That's wonderful.
SUPMALE:Does the dog do tricks? ( laughs ) No.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm I'm a singer.
SUPMALE:I I sing about the thing that I can see with my other senses.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, like, the sound of a squeaky porch swing or the friends I left back home.
LEADMALE:( normal voice ): Oh, back home.
LEADMALE:Anguish.
LEADMALE:Renewed sorrow.
LEADMALE:Mork, remember what I said? Oh.
LEADMALE:You said I'm gonna do nice things for people.
SUPMALE:Well, Tom, can I read you the newspaper or tell you if you're dressed funny? ( laughs ) I could do some mime if you'd Oh.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mork's been trying to do nice things for people to cheer himself up.
LEADFEMALE:You see, he, um He's been kind of homesick lately.
LEADMALE:Well, I I get that way too, sometimes when I'm on the road.
SUPFEMALE:MINDY: Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, it's after 8:00.
LEADFEMALE:I've got to get to work.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, how did you know what time it was? Oh, this is a special watch you can feel.
LEADMALE:See? When Mickey's left hand is pointing to the 8, and his cane is pointing to 3.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, listen, why don't you guys come along? I'm sure you could sit with Dad and see my act.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Dinah, get your leash.

LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I wonder what happened to him.
LEADMALE:Well, he's got a lot of stuff to do.
LEADMALE:I I'm sure he'll get here by the second show.

SUPFEMALE:I'm really into sports, actually.
SUPMALE:I water-ski and try to jog a few miles every day.
LEADMALE:And I love to skydive.

SUPMALE:Tom, the operator took this message for you while you were on stage.
SUPMALE:Okay? Oh, thank you, Marty.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, would you read this for me? Oh, sure.
OTHERFEMALE:All done.
LEADMALE:I'll read it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's from your dad.
LEADFEMALE:He says Oh, he says he can't be here.
SUPMALE:He was called out of town, and he'll see you on your next visit.
SUPFEMALE:( sighs ) Oh, that's too bad.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, well, that's my dad.
LEADMALE:Always on the go.
LEADFEMALE:When was the last time you two got together? Twelve years ago.
SUPFEMALE:Twelve years? And he has the nerve to stand you up? You know, no big deal.
OTHERMALE:I mean, what's a few lows with all these highs? Boy, I wish I could feel like that.
LEADFEMALE:Something's pulling at me, and I can't seem to shake it.
OTHERMALE:You know, you really can do anything you want to do.
LEADMALE:I mean, remember the old saying: "When life hands you lemons, hey, make lemonade.
LEADMALE:" I wish I could spend the day with you one day so you can teach me to enjoy the life the way you do.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not sure.
OTHERFEMALE:How can I do that? Hey, don't ask me.
LEADMALE:You're the blind guy.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Listen, are you really sure you want to do this? I want to see life the way you do.
LEADFEMALE:Ready.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:Did you ever hear the ocean As it rushes to the shore? Did you ever Really understand What your senses Were meant for? Did you ever smell That green, green grass When the rain Begins to pour? If you haven't done These special things You don't know What life is for So get high on life The best is yet to come Get high on life You better let Your senses run Get a high on life You know the rest Is up to you You know, get high on life And let your sense Come through Love your senses Get a high on life Everybody knows Everybody knows They can get high on life Oh, yippee-yo-yi kai-oh, oy-vey.
SUPFEMALE:( laughs ) Boy, I didn't know horseback riding could be such fun.
SUPFEMALE:Ho! I rode that sucker.
OTHERMALE:Whew! Yeah, you were the hit of the supermarket, all right.
LEADMALE:Too bad we ran out of quarters.
OTHERMALE:Well, my frown is down, my funk is sunk, and my gloom split the room.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm glad you had a good day.
LEADMALE:A good day? It was spectabulous.
OTHERMALE:Are you kidding? You taught me how to smell a sunset.
LEADFEMALE:( sniffs ): There are the greens.
SUPFEMALE:( sniffs ): There are the yellows.
OTHERMALE:I knew it.
LEADMALE:Can we do that again tomorrow? And tomorrow we'll bring Mindy.
LEADMALE:By the way, she wasn't there today.
LEADFEMALE:Ar-ar! I'm afraid not, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna leave town tonight after the show.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, maybe after Mindy's class, we could, um, drive you to the airport and say goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:Did I say something wrong? Maybe we could wave goodbye, but I think that would be kind of cruel.
SUPMALE:Twelve years, and he hasn't even got time to say, "Hello.
LEADMALE:" Who? My father.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I can't take it anymore.
SUPFEMALE:I'm damn tired of being brushed off.
LEADMALE:I thought you said to me that it didn't bother you.
OTHERFEMALE:I lied.
SUPFEMALE:It bothers the hell out of me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm his son.
SUPMALE:Why is he avoiding me? I'd like to throw something at a wall right now, but I'm afraid I wouldn't hit it.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you were the happiest guy in the whole world.
LEADFEMALE:I'd be a lot happier if I had a father again.
LEADFEMALE:I guess having a son with a handicap is more than he can face.
SUPMALE:I think maybe your father's the one that has the handicap.
OTHERFEMALE:( dramatic theme playing ) I just don't understand it.
LEADFEMALE:How could he ignore his own son? ( knock on door ) She'll get it.
LEADMALE:Well, look who's here.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Compassion.
LEADMALE:Hi, there.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you were out of town.
LEADMALE:Well, I fibbed a little.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, my dog Bickie and I were over at the Holiday Inn.
SUPFEMALE:Need any soap or towels? What were you doing at the nation's innkeeper? I have my reasons.
LEADFEMALE:Say, have you seen my son, Tom? Of course we've seen him.
LEADMALE:Is he okay? How does he look? Has he grown any since he was 14? Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley, why do you keep letting down your own son? I never let him down.
LEADFEMALE:I sent him to the best doctors.
LEADFEMALE:I sent him to the best schools.
LEADFEMALE:I sent him all the money he needed.
SUPMALE:And there wasn't a Christmas that went by that I didn't send him a card.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but how could he read it? Well, it's the thought that counts.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Bick, I don't know about you.
LEADFEMALE:I used to think so much of you, but now you've pushed it too far.
LEADFEMALE:I think you better go back to the Holiday Inn and join the other people that are taking a vacation away from their responsibilities.
LEADFEMALE:Please, don't send me away.
LEADMALE:Please, don't send me away.
LEADFEMALE:Where have I heard that before? A little 6-year-old boy said that to me when I had to send him away to a special school.
LEADFEMALE:It broke my heart.
LEADMALE:I couldn't afford the school, so I had to take a second job.
OTHERFEMALE:My wife was lonely.
LEADFEMALE:I was never home.
SUPFEMALE:Pretty soon, neither was she.
SUPMALE:Love doesn't keep you together.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to wring Neil Sedaka's neck.
LEADFEMALE:Bick, hiding doesn't help it.
LEADMALE:He was better off if I left him alone.
LEADFEMALE:He had to become independent.
OTHERMALE:You don't know what it's like to have a child born blind.
LEADFEMALE:And what do you do, keep him inside so he'll be safe or f-freeze every time you hear a car horn? I had to make Tommy fend for himself, and now he probably hates me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:He doesn't hate you, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley.
LEADMALE:He'd like to be with you very much.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? Well, the kid has rotten taste.
SUPMALE:Listen, we were just gonna meet him at the club to drive him to the airport.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you come along with us and say goodbye? Goodbye? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Tom's leaving tonight.
OTHERMALE:Well no, I couldn't.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't know what to say after "goodbye.
LEADMALE:" Well, maybe Bickley's right.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, it's only been 12 years.
OTHERMALE:What's there to talk about? Yeah, actually, he probably is better off without you.
SUPMALE:I mean, look at you.
SUPMALE:You're mean, you're ornery, you're self-involved.
LEADFEMALE:What could you possibly have to offer him? I'm his father.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, you think he still remembers? Okay.
LEADMALE:I'll go with you.
LEADMALE:Hallelujah, you old skunk.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ) May pigeons fly upside down the next time you wash your car.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want Tom to know I'm in the room.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna be totally silent.
LEADMALE:And if either of you lets on I'm there, I'm gonna walk right out.
SUPFEMALE:Then why even bother coming? I want to see him.
LEADMALE:I may be gutless, but I'm not heartless.
LEADMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( playing ) Hey, Tom, it's us.
LEADFEMALE:Mork and Mindy and And Mindy and Mork.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'm I'm glad you both could make it.
LEADFEMALE:My bags are packed and I'm ready to go.
LEADMALE:Leaving on a jet plane, huh? I thought I'd get to the airport early and pick out a window seat.
LEADFEMALE:Ar-ar-ar-ar.
SUPFEMALE:Mork taught me that.
LEADMALE:And Tom taught me to give life a feel.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I'm gonna miss you, you big palooka.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna miss you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna miss both of you.
OTHERMALE:I'm just sorry that I didn't get a chance to see my dad.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you haven't left town yet.
LEADFEMALE:The night's but a fetus.
LEADMALE:Come, let's sit and talk in a kind of mellow way.
LEADFEMALE:We'll share some energy and be one, you know? You know, Tom, I really don't know Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Bickley very well.
LEADFEMALE:What was he like as a father? ( sighs ): Well Dad Dad was, uh, stubborn and cranky and grouchy and grumpy.
LEADMALE:Sounds like a law firm for dwarfs.
SUPMALE:I couldn't wait till he got home at night.
OTHERMALE:He always seemed to have time to play with me.
LEADFEMALE:So you're saying that he was a good father.
SUPMALE:TOM: Yeah, he really was unbelievable.
LEADFEMALE:You know, he gave the best piggybacks in the world and didn't even seem to mind when I left gum in his ear.
SUPMALE:And I remember the time he bought me a baseball.
LEADMALE:Two hundred and thirty-six stitches on that thing.
SUPFEMALE:And I remember swimming toward the sound of his voice my first time across the pool, And he said, "You can make it, Tom.
LEADFEMALE:You can make it, Tom.
LEADMALE:" And I did.
OTHERMALE:And then there was the last Christmas we spent at home.
LEADMALE:And Dad opened the picture that I drew of him with crayon, and he said, "It looks just like me, Tom.
LEADFEMALE:" I wish I had a father like that.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't know Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley had those kind of feelings.
SUPMALE:I wonder why people always hide the feelings that give them the most pleasure.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I've I've got a song that I wrote.
OTHERFEMALE:I think it's kind of special.
SUPMALE:I I'd like to sing it.
LEADFEMALE:MINDY: Oh, yeah, we'd like that.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I'd like it a lot.
LEADFEMALE:( playing ) Beauty is in the eyes Of the beholder And that's what I want to do Hold you in my life forever And just keep on loving you Beauty's in the eyes Of the beholder So take a special look And see And Just possibly You will see the love And beauty That's in you and me Hey Look for the beauty Please That was for you, Dad.
LEADMALE:How? How did you know I was here? You're still wearing that awful-smelling after-shave.
LEADMALE:I could find you when I was lost in a circus.
LEADFEMALE:It doesn't take a lot to find you in an empty room.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:What did you learn this week, Mork? Well, this week, sir, I learned to see by closing my eyes.
OTHERFEMALE:Have you been smoking your socks again, Mork? Oh, no, sir.
LEADMALE:I met a man with no eyes who saw beauty everywhere.
SUPMALE:Are there many people on Earth without sight? Oh, quite a few, sir, and generally they're looked upon as being handicapped.
LEADFEMALE:Are people on Earth born with handicaps? Some are, but others create their own by giving up on themselves.
LEADFEMALE:You really have learned to see, haven't you, Mork? Oh, better than ever, sir.
SUPMALE:There's so much in life for us to sense and enjoy if we just wouldn't be so blind to it.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, sir.
SUPMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu! ( upbeat theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) ( morosely ) Oh, Mind, I'm so excited.
SUPFEMALE:You are? Yes, can't you tell? Hey, nonny nonny, and a ha-cha-cha.
OTHERFEMALE:Sit down and tell me all about it.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I just finished talking to Orson about vacations.
LEADMALE:I really need to get away.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you have been kind of dragged out lately.
SUPMALE:Like yesterday when you fell asleep jogging.
LEADMALE:Observing your planet is really hard work.
LEADFEMALE:I've worn out two pairs of eyes already.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you don't do that when we have people over.
OTHERMALE:It's been so long since I've had a real vacation.
OTHERMALE:Well, what about that time at the lake? ( groans ) Uh, I guess that wasn't so hot, was it? No, it wasn't very much fun.
LEADMALE:But I did learn and important lesson though.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? What was that? That I can't breathe underwater.
SUPFEMALE:Gave me a lot of admiration for Shamu.
SUPMALE:Why are all our vacations so full of surprises? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I thought going to Exidor's cabin would be nice.
OTHERMALE:I mean, who knew it didn't have any windows? Or walls.
LEADMALE:Or a roof.
LEADMALE:A distinct disadvantage in a blizzard.
SUPMALE:That's why I took you to the desert, to thaw out.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:To that nude ranch.
SUPFEMALE:Dude ranch.
LEADMALE:At least the rooms were nice.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, the weather was nice too.
LEADFEMALE:Come to think of it, that was the nicest vacation we ever had.
LEADFEMALE:( dreamy theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) ( Mork groaning ) I guess I never should have taken you horseback riding, huh? It was lots of fun, Mind, really, except for when I fell off the horse and he dragged me for two miles.
OTHERFEMALE:Why didn't you let go? Well, at $12 an hour, it didn't seem right.
LEADFEMALE:I just wish he hadn't dragged you through the cactus.
LEADMALE:Yeah, me too.
SUPFEMALE:Aah, aah.
OTHERMALE:Ah-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:( yelling ) I guess we didn't get 'em all.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, believe me, Mork, this is supposed to be one of the finest vacation spots in New Mexico.
LEADMALE:Aah, ahh! I believe you, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, two million scorpions can't be wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:I just feel so bad for you.
SUPMALE:Look at you.
LEADFEMALE:You've been bruised, battered, beaten Ow! Ahh! ( groaning ) I forgot about sunburned.
LEADMALE:Let me look at it.
LEADMALE:Ohh.
SUPFEMALE:Ahh.
SUPMALE:Well, it's better than yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, I was once on the sun and didn't get this badly burned.
OTHERMALE:Honest, Mork, people usually have a great time when they come to a place like this.
OTHERFEMALE:Mindy, can I ask you one question? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:How? ( knocking on door ) Oh, come in.
LEADMALE:Howdy, buckaroos! I'm Ricky Day, activity director here at the old lazy Hacienda.
SUPMALE:You know what's coming up in 10 minutes? Shuffleboard! Whoa, yay, shuffleboard! What's that? Oh, you're gonna love it, cowpoke.
LEADMALE:We just need two more for the big tournament.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:How many do you have now? None.
LEADFEMALE:Then at 3:00, it's a long hike out into the desert.
OTHERMALE:You know what you're gonna see there? The bones of yesterday's hikers.
LEADMALE:And then it's a quick jog back for the chili-eating contest, and then an even quicker jog over to the arts-and-crafts center.
OTHERMALE:Wouldn't you like to make a lanyard? Oh, Lordy! I guess it's a lot better than buying one.
OTHERMALE:I made this one for my wife.
LEADFEMALE:Sure takes the pressure out of holiday gift-giving.
OTHERFEMALE:Gee, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Day, these things sound like a lot of fun They do? But right now I think Mork and I would like to rest.
LEADMALE:Rest? On vacation? Oh, ho-ho.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I got you.
LEADMALE:Well, you have fun resting, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Aah! Ha-ha-ha-aahh! Oh, uh, say, folks, if you can rouse yourself up, don't miss the big slide show in the rec room tonight, Dale Evans, the Early Years.
LEADFEMALE:( door closes ) Well, Mind, I'll be a good sport.
LEADMALE:I'll shuffle boards with you.
LEADFEMALE:I'll make you an ashtray.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, what do you want to do? Aah.
LEADFEMALE:Go home.
LEADMALE:I thought you'd never ask.
LEADFEMALE:( dreamy theme playing ) Mind, I finally figured out why that vacation was gopher gunk.
LEADMALE:I didn't go far enough away from where I work.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, we drove all the way to New Mexico.
LEADMALE:No, I mean really away.
SUPMALE:I mean, I've talked to Orson, and I've gotta go to another planet far, far, far away.
SUPFEMALE:You're gonna leave Earth? Where are you gonna go? Well, I've written up a little itinerary.
SUPMALE:The planet Murrowr? Well, they say it's got a great nightlife.
SUPMALE:Planet Hmm-Hmm-Hmm? Yep, yep, yep.
SUPFEMALE:It's a party planet, Mind.
LEADMALE:The fun and frolic never stop there, and the atmosphere is 98 percent nitrous oxide.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry I can't take you along, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I have to go to school anyway.
SUPMALE:And I guess it's more important that you go on the vacation that's right for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Take good care of my body.
LEADFEMALE:Your body? Well, yes.
LEADMALE:See, when we Orkans go on trips, our mind and spirit leave and we leave our body behind.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:You mean you're saying that your body's gonna stay here, and the rest is going somewhere else? Yes, we Orkans like to travel light.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, you mean you're going on vacation, and what I'll have here is an empty shell? No, no, only until my mind checks into another body on another planet, and his mind checks into my body.
LEADMALE:It's kind of like house swapping.
LEADFEMALE:That's incredible.
LEADFEMALE:You mean I'm gonna have some creature from outer space living here with me? No, two of them.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but what if they're strange? Like an alien? What, you mean like: ( bleats ) Yeah, like that.
LEADMALE:No, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:I'm only going to Earth-like planets, and nothing in the brochure said anything about Mindavores.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, I'm gonna miss you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm gonna miss you too, Mind.
LEADMALE:I hope you have a good time.
LEADMALE:Why, I'll try.
OTHERFEMALE:I've written up a little inventory of my body here so none of the guests can run away with the good parts.
LEADFEMALE:Check once in a while and make sure nothing's missing.
LEADFEMALE:Especially that one.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Um, well, when are you leaving? Now.
LEADMALE:Bye.
OTHERFEMALE:( Beeping ) Wait.
LEADFEMALE:How long are you gonna be gone? Mork? Mork? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:This is very weird.
LEADFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( meowing ) ( meowing ) Darn cats.
OTHERMALE:( meowing ) It sounds like it's coming from in here.
OTHERFEMALE:( hisses ) ( screeching ) I don't believe it.
LEADMALE:He went to a cat planet? Planet Murrowr.
OTHERFEMALE:( meows ): Murrowr.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that's right.
LEADMALE:Great night life.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Well, uh, welcome to Boulder, kitty.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, bad, bad.
SUPFEMALE:( hisses ) ( meowing ) There Hey, you're kind of cute.
LEADMALE:( meows ) Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you don't shed.
LEADFEMALE:I used to have a cat when I was a kid.
SUPFEMALE:It wasn't this big, though.
LEADFEMALE:You must be tired from your trip.
SUPMALE:I'll get you something to eat.
LEADMALE:You like some milk? ( meows ) Whoa, whoa, down, down.
SUPFEMALE:( meows ) Okay, never mind.
OTHERFEMALE:There.
LEADFEMALE:Nice kitty.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to play with you some more, but I've got an early class, and I've gotta get ready.
LEADMALE:( mischievous theme playing ) ( meows ) Boy, are the neighborhood birds in for a surprise.
LEADMALE:( hacking ) Well, I guess it saves on soap.
OTHERMALE:What do cats like? What do cats like? Warm.
SUPFEMALE:So I'll turn up the heat.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I know.
SUPMALE:( meows ) Sure am glad I saved this box.
LEADMALE:Kitty, right there.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, so I guess I'll see you a little later.
LEADFEMALE:Be good.
SUPMALE:( Meows ) Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:( meowing ) ( knocking on door ) Anybody home? Mork, I'm late for work, so I've gotta make this quick.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't wake you up, did I? ( meows ) Sorry.
OTHERMALE:You know, Mindy told Jean and I to tell her when our mom was coming in town from New York 'cause she wanted to have us all over for dinner, and We'd like to make it tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, it's hot in here, huh? Hey, I'll open a window, okay? Um, hey, Mork, don't forget to tell Mindy about dinner tonight.
LEADMALE:( meows ) Yeah, I'm that way in the morning too.
SUPFEMALE:( suspenseful theme playing ) ( meows ) ( screeches ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Hi, I'm back.
LEADMALE:I got you the biggest one I could find.
LEADFEMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
LEADMALE:Here, kitty, kitty.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no! Here, kitty, kitty, kitty! Here, kitty, kitty! Oh.
SUPMALE:Not you, Irving.
LEADFEMALE:Go home.
LEADMALE:Oh, what am I gonna do now? I can't call the police.
LEADMALE:They're gonna think I'm crazy.
LEADMALE:Who can I get to help me? It's worth a try, I guess.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mindy calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Mindy calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Yo, your fattitude! I didn't think it would work.
SUPFEMALE:( knocking on door ) Oh, Mork, I hope that's you.
LEADMALE:Hi, are you Mindy McConnell? Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:This is the place.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:A dog chased him up a tree.
LEADFEMALE:Man, I wish I could climb like that.
LEADMALE:He hasn't moved in 20 minutes.
LEADMALE:That poodle sure must have scared him.
SUPFEMALE:We found this note in his pocket.
SUPMALE:"Property of Mindy McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:" That's me, and at the right address.
LEADMALE:Well, thanks, you guys.
LEADMALE:I was really worried about him.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you want him? Oh, right there's fine.
LEADFEMALE:Well, goodbye, Miss McConnell.
SUPMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:Oh, can I give you boys anything? Oh, no, thank you.
LEADMALE:Just cut his nails before you let him out next time.
SUPFEMALE:He likes to scratch.
SUPFEMALE:Is this your boyfriend? Uh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, and you seem like such a normal girl.
SUPFEMALE:Goodbye.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, are you all right? You look all right.
SUPMALE:Oh, boy, Mork, I know how much this vacation meant to you, but I wish you could have taken your body with you.
LEADFEMALE:( beeping ) Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:Are you dangerous? You tell me.
LEADMALE:( laughing ) Whoa! Oh, you got it.
LEADMALE:( laughing ) Wait.
SUPMALE:Oh, oh.
LEADMALE:Let go of me.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I know you may find me a little grotesque in my present form, but where I come from, I have six arms and a propeller.
LEADMALE:( imitates propeller whirring ) You, uh You must be from the planet Hmm-Hmm-Hmm.
SUPFEMALE:No, that's: Heh-Heh-Heh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:( shrieks ) ( laughing ) You know, I came here to have a good time.
LEADMALE:Yeah? Well, great.
SUPFEMALE:You can call me 12.
LEADMALE:Twelve? On a scale of one to ten, I'm a 12.
LEADFEMALE:( laughing ) Oh-ho-ho.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad you feel Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Welcome on your trip, but I'm not one of the tourist attractions.
LEADFEMALE:( imitates propeller whirring ) Oh, uh Uhh.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Mmm.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Shh! Shh! There's so little time and so much to sniff.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, will you look at these grotesque body wrappings? Eww! Do you have anything else I can wear here? Uh, there's a lot more upstairs, but they all look like that.
LEADMALE:Oh! No wonder they say never swap bodies with an Orkan.
OTHERMALE:Come here.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey, hey.
LEADFEMALE:Mwah! I told you to stop that.
SUPMALE:( laughing ) You're lucky.
LEADFEMALE:I only used one lip.
LEADMALE:( imitates propeller whirring ) ( knocking on door ) Oh, please be Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, we're here.
LEADMALE:Oh, you are? Oh, you are.
SUPMALE:I'd like you to meet our mom.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, It's nice to meet you, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:DaVinci.
LEADMALE:Call me Rosa.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Don't they hug in Colorado? Oh, sure.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Mama has to get her Italian hug quota in for the day.
SUPMALE:I'm starving.
SUPFEMALE:When's dinner? Dinner? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Didn't Mork tell you? Oh, yeah, he did, but I haven't put it on yet.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's still at the store.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, Mork's shopping, okay? I told Mama here that you and Mork were our two best friends in Boulder.
LEADMALE:This Mork.
LEADMALE:He lives here too? Don't worry, Mom.
LEADMALE:Mork's a nice guy.
SUPFEMALE:Remy, the commandments don't say it's okay with a nice guy.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, you have to forgive me, Mindy, but you see, I've been worried about my kids getting mixed up with a bunch of beatniks out West.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Jerry Brown and that gang.
LEADMALE:( laughing ) Mork? This is Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice Guy? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:He's been taking dancing lessons.
LEADFEMALE:I'm back, babe.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Mork, but Mwah.
LEADMALE:Not now.

SUPMALE:JEAN: Mork.
LEADMALE:I'd like you to meet our mother.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey.
LEADMALE:Oh, oh, oh, oh.

LEADFEMALE:Wait till I tell your father's grave.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come here, my little pasta.
SUPFEMALE:Volare Oh, oh Save me! Aah! Mork, put her down.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, down? Let's party! Ow! Party! Ow! He's so vulnerable.
LEADFEMALE:I never had this much fun when I went out with lawyers.
OTHERFEMALE:Heh-heh.
SUPFEMALE:Come, let's go upstairs and we'll play habeas corpus.
LEADFEMALE:( laughing ) Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe Mork needs some help up there.
LEADFEMALE:One move and I'll break your legs.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma! I never knew Mork was quite like this.
LEADMALE:Fun, isn't he? ( disco music playing upstairs ) Maybe you all should come back tomorrow, and we'll We'll try this again.
LEADMALE:I think things will be different.
LEADMALE:I promise.
SUPFEMALE:I hope.
SUPMALE:( women and Mork giggling upstairs ) Nice suit he's wearing.
LEADMALE:He'll be the best-dressed guy in hell.
LEADFEMALE:REMO: I've never been so embarrassed in my entire life.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, if you only knew what you were missing.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, what a dud he turned out to be.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, just another jerk in a white suit.
OTHERMALE:( door closes ) Have a nice day.
SUPMALE:Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Twelve? ( disco music stops ) Well, I guess it's just you and me again, even though you're not all there yet.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I hope you have a nice trip back.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) ( gasps ) Mork, are you all right? I hope you didn't break anything.
LEADMALE:Who am I talking to? ( beeping ) Oh! I'm back, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I'm glad.
LEADMALE:Sorry I was late.
LEADFEMALE:I got hung up in turbulence over Saturn.
LEADMALE:I think I kind of blew my mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy, did I miss you.
SUPMALE:Oh, I missed you too.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, have you been playing dress up with my body? No, it was one of the visitors.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I think I can guess which one.
SUPMALE:I hope they didn't cause too much trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let's just say I learned to appreciate you a lot more.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you have a good time? Well, It was nice but I'd rather be in New Mexico with you.
LEADMALE:Really? I thought you hated that place.
LEADMALE:Oh, at least I was with you, though.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's nice.
OTHERMALE:I learned a lot about vacations, Mind.
LEADMALE:I've learned that you can go to all the interesting places, but unless you have someone you care about with you, it doesn't mean as much.
SUPMALE:You've got to turn to someone and say, "Hey, Mind, did you see that fire-breathing dragon? "Oh, I guess you did.
LEADFEMALE:Your eyebrows are missing and your hair is curled.
LEADMALE:" So you like it better right here in your own body, huh? Yeah, there's no place like Mork, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I brought back some slides to show you though.
LEADFEMALE:You did? Well, let's see them.
OTHERMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:( squeaks ) There's me on the planet Murrowr.
OTHERMALE:( both chuckle ) There's me picking fleas out of my tail.
LEADMALE:Here's me meeting the catnip dealer.
LEADFEMALE:Um, do you happen to, uh Do you happen to have any pictures of your vacation on the planet Heh-Heh-Heh? No, I had to burn those, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Well, who wants to see pictures of me going: Yeah, right.
SUPMALE:Besides, it wasn't a very nice trip anyway, Mind.
LEADMALE:I spent the entire time in my room because I couldn't get my propeller started.
LEADFEMALE:( imitates squeaky propeller ) ( upbeat disco theme playing ) ( suspenseful theme playing ) MORK: Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:( blowing air ) Is this thing on? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Attention, vacationers, Pedro and Yolanda will be giving mambo lessons poolside, 3:00 ORSON: Well, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Sir.
OTHERMALE:How was your vacation? Well, not bad, sir.
SUPMALE:Except I would have liked to have taken along someone that I really cared about.
LEADFEMALE:I understand, Mork.
LEADMALE:Thank you, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Next time I'll go with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, actually, Your Astrodome-ness, I would have rather taken along Mindy.
LEADMALE:Not that I don't want to travel with you, sir, except she'd be less dangerous in an upper berth.
LEADFEMALE:Your report, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, sir.
LEADMALE:I've discovered that Earthlings come back from a vacation much more exhausted than when they left.
LEADFEMALE:Why is that? Well, I think they treat a vacation like a job.
SUPMALE:They try and cram in every activity except for that which is most important: Relaxation.
LEADMALE:I thought the main purpose of a vacation is to get away from it all.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's what Earthlings say too, sir, except they pack it in eight suitcases and bring it all with them.
LEADFEMALE:Strange.
SUPMALE:What's even stranger, sir, is they say they can't wait to get away from all their friends, but they spend all day writing postcards saying: "Wish you were here.
LEADMALE:Send money.
OTHERMALE:" It sounds like Earthlings would be better off without vacations.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the problem is that they try and cram all of their happiness into only two weeks out of the year.
OTHERMALE:Why shouldn't all of life be a nice trip, sir? Nanu, nanu, little buckaroo.
SUPMALE:Scenery is here.
LEADFEMALE:Wish I was beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Happy trails
LEADFEMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu! ( upbeat theme playing ) Hi, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:I'm home.
LEADFEMALE:( screams ) May I take your coat? What are you doing in there? Trying to make your day a little bit better.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:Come.
SUPMALE:Rest your weary bod.
SUPFEMALE:There we go.
LEADMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, wait, wait, wait.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa! No.
LEADMALE:Rest yourself there.
SUPMALE:It's been a hard day at work, hasn't it, honey? There we go.
LEADFEMALE:A little mental massage.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooh-ooh, ah-ooh There we go.
LEADMALE:There.
SUPFEMALE:You cozy yet? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I really appreciate what you're doing, but I haven't even been to work yet.
LEADMALE:I brought it all home with me.
LEADFEMALE:See? Oh.
LEADMALE:Then the Algerian mud rub is out.
OTHERFEMALE:( chuckles ) I guess so.
OTHERFEMALE:Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:What? How come you haven't told me what you're doing at the newspaper yet? Because I'm not supposed to tell anybody.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:But you gotta promise not to tell anybody else.
LEADMALE:My lips are stapled.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:See, I'm working at the Boulder Journal for a couple of weeks.
SUPMALE:They hired me to answer the mail that comes in to their Lonelyhearts column.
LEADFEMALE:What's a "Lonelyhearts" column? Oh, I know, spare parts for donors.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Lonelyhearts column, it's for people who write in and ask for personal advice.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, but why would they write in to a total stranger? I guess sometimes it's easier to, uh, bare your soul to someone you don't know.
OTHERMALE:To tell you the truth, I'm kinda nervous about this 'cause I've never done anything like this before.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mind, you're good at giving advice, like that time you told me not to eat soup with the thin end of the spoon.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Well, my Journalism professor recommended me for the job.
OTHERMALE:And nobody is supposed to know I'm doing this.
OTHERFEMALE:See, the regular Miss Lonelyhearts is in Reno getting his divorce.
LEADFEMALE:Are the letters in there? Can I read them, please? I mean, I am a super-intelligent alien with highly attuned powers of sensitivity.
SUPFEMALE:Please, give me a chance.
LEADMALE:Eeh.
LEADFEMALE:I can tell you what that one's about already too.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:How would a highly evolved being answer this one? All right.
LEADMALE:Let's see.
SUPFEMALE:"Dear Miss Lonelyhearts, "I found a pair of pantyhose in my husband's pocket.
LEADFEMALE:Should I be worried?" Don't panic.
LEADFEMALE:They may not be his.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a whiz.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm right there.
LEADMALE:Next.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Mork, listen to this one.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:"Dear Miss Lonelyheart, "I've only lived in Boulder a few months "but they've been very lonely months.
LEADMALE:Somehow, men just don't notice me.
LEADFEMALE:" Poor guy.
LEADMALE:( clears throat ) "I'm not looking for anyone that unusual, "just a nice guy who's sensitive, likes the same things I like, "and is genuinely interested in what I have to say.
SUPMALE:"The trouble is I'm so busy every day, "going to a school and working in a deli, "I hardly have the opportunity to meet anyone or maybe I just don't know how.
SUPMALE:Please help me.
SUPMALE:" signed "J.
LEADMALE:From New York.
SUPMALE:" This letter's from Jeanie! She sounds pretty low, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, she sure does.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, I'd sure like to see her meet a guy like the one she described.
LEADMALE:Would that make you happy, Mind? It sure would.
LEADMALE:We gotta help her somehow.
LEADFEMALE:First thing I've gotta do is figure out how to answer this letter.
SUPFEMALE:What we have to do basically is work out how she doesn't know that you and I know that she knows that she doesn't know that we know it.
OTHERFEMALE:I wish it were that easy.
OTHERMALE:WOMAN: Waitress.
SUPMALE:Waitress! Jeanie Oh! More coffee? Sorry.
OTHERMALE:You want a new bag? Just our checks, please.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, uh, certainly.
OTHERMALE:WOMAN: Come on, let's go.
LEADMALE:Here's your money.
SUPMALE:( coins clink ) Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Jeanie.
LEADMALE:Can I see you for a minute? You know, for the last couple of weeks, you've been walking around in a daze.
SUPMALE:Uh, Remo, I'm a little lonely.
OTHERMALE:That's it? How can you be lonely? You got me, you got your friends, you got a television in your room.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, it's not that kind of lonely, Remo.
OTHERMALE:I need a guy who thinks I'm special.
SUPFEMALE:No problem.
LEADFEMALE:What about Turk down at the gas station? Remember he whistled at ya? He's a great guy.
SUPFEMALE:He once bowled 260.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Remo, but a woman needs more than that.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm not I'm not looking for Mr.
SUPMALE:Perfect here.
LEADFEMALE:I just want a guy who's sensitive, likes what I like, cares what I have to say.
LEADMALE:There's nobody like that around.
SUPMALE:You wanna know something? I get lonely too.
SUPFEMALE:Boulder's a long way from New York.
LEADMALE:We're a couple of fish out of pollution.
LEADFEMALE:It's hard to find your way, but you gotta hang in there.
SUPMALE:Someday you're gonna meet a great guy who will appreciate you as much as I do.
OTHERMALE:I hope you're right.
OTHERMALE:I know I'm right.
LEADMALE:You know, I haven't found the right girl for me either.
LEADMALE:But I figure why not have fun with the wrong ones while I'm waiting.
OTHERFEMALE:Meanwhile, we have each other.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen, why don't you let me close up for you tonight? No.
LEADMALE:I'll close up.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:You know, I'll see you later on when I get home from Turk's.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:You sure you don't mind? No.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:You take it easy, huh? I'm not going anyplace anyway.
OTHERMALE:( knocking ) Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:I was just in here closing up.
SUPMALE:I was just out here knocking.
LEADMALE:I think I hurt my hands because I guess I'm such a sensitive guy.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, you wanna come on in? Oh, thanks.
OTHERMALE:Can I? You know, I'm really fascinated by delicatessens.
OTHERFEMALE:I bet you are too, huh? ( giggles ) Uh, Mork, you okay? Sure.
LEADMALE:I guess okay as a sensitive guy can be.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! You've got a dirty-dish collection too.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:You collect dirty dishes? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:For about a week, and then Mindy makes me clean it up.
OTHERFEMALE:( laughing ) Ah.
LEADMALE:Can I get you something? Oh, no thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Then why are you here? Just to keep you company.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:What did you say? "Oh.
SUPFEMALE:" Fascinating.
LEADMALE:Um, Mork, I don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:The deli's closed.
SUPMALE:Well, I You know, I was just thinking how much we two have in common.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding.
SUPFEMALE:Like what? Well, for one thing, we both don't eat live game.
LEADMALE:Arr! Arr! And we both love to laugh.
LEADMALE:Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar! Ar, ar, ar, ar! Isn't that kind of uncanny? Mork, you seem sort of different tonight.
SUPMALE:I sure do.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, uh I gotta finish cleaning up.
SUPFEMALE:Then what are you gonna do? Uh walk home.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I could walk with you, kind of tag along.
LEADFEMALE:We can do this.
SUPMALE:Maybe talk.
LEADFEMALE:We could be little walkie-talkies.
SUPFEMALE:You know, no one's walked me home in a real long time.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm not worried.
OTHERFEMALE:I think you remember where it is.
LEADFEMALE:Mm! Look! I made the newspaper.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:They printed my first replies in the Lonelyhearts column.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, congrats, kudos, and plaudits.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:What did you tell her? I shall read it to you.
OTHERMALE:Well, I shall be attentive.
SUPFEMALE:"Dear J.
SUPFEMALE:From New York, "It's not easy leaving all your friends "and moving far away from home.
LEADMALE:"You feel like an island in the midst of a sea of strangers.
LEADMALE:" Took me half an hour to come up with that one.
LEADMALE:That's a catchy phrase, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Tennessee Williams, move over.
LEADMALE:Here comes Colorado McConnell.
SUPFEMALE:"It's possible that the person you're looking for "is somebody you see every day but are just too busy to notice.
SUPMALE:"Look around you.
SUPFEMALE:"If he's there, try not to be shy.
LEADFEMALE:"Reach out and show him how you feel.
OTHERMALE:"He might become interested in you if he sees you're interested in him.
OTHERMALE:" That's wonderful, Mind.
LEADMALE:You're gonna make Abby crabby.
LEADMALE:( chuckles ) You think? I just hope it helps Jeanie.
LEADMALE:I was helping her yesterday.
LEADMALE:You were? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I went over to the deli last night and cheered her up.
LEADMALE:You didn't tell her about the letters, did you? No, I just walked her home and gave her a few laughs.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:That's nice.
LEADFEMALE:The worst thing we could do is embarrass her.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Why are you building a tower of Cheerios? Because it's hard to stack oatmeal.
OTHERFEMALE:Why do I ask? I have to get to class, so, uh, I'll see you a little later.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:If you get hungry, your peanut butter pagoda's on the refrigerator.
SUPFEMALE:I'll never remember what order they were in.
LEADFEMALE:One-oh-four.
LEADMALE:( knocking ) ( laughs ) I feel like I'm living on a fault line.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Can I come in? ( as Southern preacher ): I know you can do it! Just put one foot forward! I came by 'cause I wanted to thank you again for walking me home last night.
OTHERFEMALE:I really did enjoy it.
LEADFEMALE:( normal voice ): I had fun too, especially leapfrogging over those fire hydrants.
LEADMALE:Too bad about that dog, huh? You know, Mork, um, ever since I moved here, I've sort of felt like an island in a sea of strangers.
LEADFEMALE:That's a catchy phrase.
SUPMALE:I mean, I know what it's like to be a stranger in a strange land.
LEADFEMALE:Does Mindy know that you walked me home last night? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I told her all about it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how does she feel about that? Well, she says if you're happy, she's happy.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy once told me that you and she were just good friends.
SUPMALE:Is that still the way it is? Well, yeah, we're buddies.
LEADFEMALE:That's all? That's enough.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there's something that I forgot to give you last night.
SUPFEMALE:Why did you do that? Well, 'cause, uh, I really hope that maybe we can keep seeing each other like we did last night.
OTHERFEMALE:You mean we could do something very special like ringing doorbells and hide.
LEADFEMALE:Your answer to my letter helped me a lot.
LEADFEMALE:When I took the time to look around me, I found someone who was there all along, but I never realized how wonderful he is.
LEADMALE:He came to my house the other night for dinner, and we had a terrific time.
LEADFEMALE:He's so thoughtful.
SUPMALE:He brought me this little gift, which will always remind me of him.
LEADFEMALE:Before dinner we sat together for a while and talked.
LEADFEMALE:The night had just begun, and already we were closer.
LEADFEMALE:Before we knew it, we found ourselves holding hands.
LEADMALE:Pretty soon one thing led to another.
SUPMALE:When it came time for dinner, I realized he's one of the few guys I've met who tries to be a gentleman.
LEADFEMALE:And in addition to all his other good qualities, he really knows how to make me laugh.
LEADFEMALE:He has everything I've ever wanted in a guy.
LEADMALE:He's so sensitive, gentle, he wouldn't hurt a fly.
LEADMALE:( buzzing ) ( splash ) ( intermittent buzzing ) ( buzzing ) He's such a good listener.
SUPMALE:He really cares about whatever I have to say.
LEADMALE:And, you know, he likes the same things that I like.
LEADFEMALE:It's almost like a dream come true.
LEADMALE:I just hope it won't be long before he starts getting serious.
LEADMALE:Thanks again for your kind help.
OTHERMALE:Gratefully, J.
LEADMALE:From New York.
SUPMALE:She must have found somebody great! "I hope it won't be too long before he starts getting serious.
SUPMALE:" ( knock on door ) Serious.
LEADMALE:If she wants serious, I'll give her serious.
SUPMALE:Hi, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:( as Nixon ): Hello, Jean, and I really mean that.
LEADFEMALE:Are you glad to see me? Indeed, I am, Jean.
SUPFEMALE:Make no mistake about that.
SUPMALE:Is everything all right? You seem sort of strange.
SUPFEMALE:I'm really in one of my serious moods, Jeanie.
LEADMALE:See? Uh, is Mindy home? No, she's not here right now.
SUPFEMALE:But you can ask anyone: Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley, Exidor They know her.
SUPFEMALE:They'll vouch for me.
SUPMALE:I am not a liar.
LEADMALE:Oh, it was such a hectic day.
OTHERMALE:I thought it would be fun just to come over, and we could sit and talk for a while.
LEADMALE:Well, perhaps I could tell you one of my favorite jokes.
LEADFEMALE:What's black and white and red all over? I know.
LEADMALE:You're thinking, "a penguin with a heat rash.
SUPMALE:" but no-o-o-o, no-o-o-o, it's not that.
LEADFEMALE:It's not a nun with a sunburn, either.
SUPFEMALE:Now, come here.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you the secret.
LEADFEMALE:( gasps ) Did you hear a hum? ( laughing ) We'll have to discuss this at another time.
LEADFEMALE:You are too much, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:I'm home.
OTHERFEMALE:She's home.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mindy.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I've been wanting to tell you how much fun I've been having with Mork.
LEADMALE:Fun with Mork? ( normal voice ): I've been showing her a good time.
LEADMALE:Wink, wink.
LEADMALE:And I hope it will be for a lot more days to come.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, I'm so glad it's okay with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Me too.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Do you remember that blue blouse I borrowed from you last week? Uh, well, it's in the bedroom right now.
LEADFEMALE:Could you get it for me please? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Don't tell me you're the terrific guy she's been writing me about?! Yep, it's me.
LEADMALE:Don't you realize what you've done? But you said it was nice if I made her happy.
SUPMALE:Then when she wanted to see me again, I thought that was even nicer.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:Jeanie wants more than just a friend.
SUPMALE:She wants somebody she can spend her life with.
SUPFEMALE:You mean like you and I share our lives? And then some.
SUPMALE:I forgot all about this blouse.
LEADMALE:Mork, uh, if you like it, I could wear it tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Um would you like to sit down? Jeanie, um I think we have a problem here.
LEADFEMALE:A big one.
LEADMALE:I, uh, don't know how to tell you this, but, uh, I think I have to before it goes too far, if it hasn't already.
LEADFEMALE:Uh See I'm Miss Lonelyhearts.
OTHERMALE:( chuckles nervously ) What? Uh, I I've been reading your letters, and I guess so has Mork.
SUPMALE:And, uh, see, I was only trying to help.
LEADMALE:Um, I I got this job at Jeanie Wait, Jeanie.
LEADFEMALE:Um, I gotta go.
LEADFEMALE:You told me you wanted me to make her happy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but the trouble is you made her ecstatic.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what a tangled web I weave.
LEADMALE:I don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:Why'd you have to write those letters? Why couldn't you come talk to me? I'm your brother.
LEADMALE:I didn't wanna dump my problems on you, Remo.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna drown my sorrows in rocky road.
OTHERFEMALE:What good are these shoulders of steel if my little sister can't? Can't lean on 'em once in a while? I made a fool of myself, didn't I, Remo? It's not your fault.
LEADMALE:How were you supposed to know.
SUPFEMALE:Mork was such a heartbreaker? I'd have never guessed it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just so confused.
OTHERMALE:I don't blame ya.
OTHERMALE:Mork should have known better.
SUPFEMALE:But whatever happened, I just can't believe that Mork or Mindy would do anything to hurt ya.
LEADFEMALE:You know, if it had happened to me, I think I'd look at it in this way: Hey, at least I had a little fun.
SUPMALE:I didn't sit at home with a long face.
LEADFEMALE:I came out of my shell, and I'm not pregnant.
SUPMALE:( knock on door ) Hi, Remo.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, can we talk to Jeanie? Hey, guys, I don't think this is a real good time.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:It's important.
LEADMALE:Well, okay, but try and make her feel better, would you? Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be in my room.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry about the ironing.
LEADMALE:I'll take care of it.
LEADFEMALE:Jeanie, I just wanna say I'm really sorry, and it was really dumb of me to think I could just step into a job and become Miss Know-It-All.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, who am I to go around telling people what to do with their lives? I was just trying to be a friend.
OTHERMALE:I didn't know you wanted "and then some.
LEADMALE:" I'm sorry, Jean.
LEADMALE:Wait, guys.
SUPFEMALE:( sighs ) You see, ever since I, uh I moved to Boulder, I sort of had a hard time fitting in.
SUPFEMALE:I never told anybody, and then finally I wrote Miss Lonelyhearts.
LEADFEMALE:And she told me that this wonderful guy might be right in front of me, which he was.
SUPFEMALE:And that all I had to do was to reach out to him, which I did.
SUPFEMALE:And, guys, I had I had so much fun.
LEADMALE:But do you know why? 'Cause you both helped bring out qualities in me that I forgot I had.
LEADFEMALE:BOTH: We did? Terrific qualities.
OTHERFEMALE:And you made me realize why I haven't met that right guy.
LEADMALE:I haven't been the right girl.
LEADMALE:Oh, you always have been to us.
LEADMALE:I love you, Mork.
OTHERMALE:I love you, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks to you guys, I'm starting to love myself again.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I'm glad.
OTHERFEMALE:Me too.
LEADFEMALE:Me too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how does it look? Remo, did you ever write a letter to Miss Lonelyhearts signed "Confused"? Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:( makes horn sound ) Hey, move, will ya?! ORSON: What did you learn about this week, Mork? Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:About shyness, your thighness.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you toy with me so? Because you're there, sir.
LEADMALE:You see, sir, shyness is a major problem here on Earth.
OTHERMALE:It keeps people apart when they want to be together.
LEADMALE:They see someone they want to know, but they're afraid to approach them.
LEADFEMALE:What causes this shyness? Well, sir, I have a friend who became shy when she moved away from home to a place where she didn't know anybody.
SUPMALE:You did that too, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:I know, sir.
LEADFEMALE:At first it was very hard to feel at home here.
LEADMALE:People were so strange.
LEADMALE:They talk in heavy accents.
SUPFEMALE:They drink with their mouths.
SUPFEMALE:They sit on what we play checkers with.
LEADMALE:I finally overcame it because I was willing to reach out.
LEADFEMALE:What about your friend? She spent a lot of time feeling lonely, then she realized her best chance of going out was to be more outgoing.
SUPMALE:That reminds me of an old Orkan saying.
SUPMALE:Me too, sir.
LEADMALE:"If one stays too long in his shell, he'll wind up nuts.
LEADFEMALE:" On that same note, sir Nanu.
LEADFEMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu! ( upbeat theme playing ) Thanks for covering for me at the grocery store, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's all right, Jud.
LEADMALE:I know what it was like the first time I tried to put a live lobster in a shopping cart.
LEADFEMALE:I guess we shouldn't have bagged our own groceries.
LEADMALE:Ooh, dead bread.
SUPFEMALE:Well, at least now we can have pumpernickel tortillas.
OTHERFEMALE:Looks like you don't have to worry about scrambling your eggs, either.
SUPFEMALE:Aw! It's not a pretty sight, is it? Well, at least they died with their shells on.
LEADMALE:May you rest in pieces! I've never seen anyone get so emotional over eggs.
SUPMALE:Oh, each one of those eggs represents 76 chicken hours, Jud.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Mork, ever since I moved into this neighborhood, you've been one of my best friends.
SUPMALE:Thanks for taking me to the movies.
LEADFEMALE:How'd you like it? Well, for such a conceptually interesting film, I usually like to see it twice, You know, I found the production values reminiscent of Bergman, and the dramatic values reminiscent of Fellini but what bothers me is, why did the coyote, after the roadrunner blew him up, come back 5 seconds later? How should I know? I don't even understand what you said.
LEADMALE:Uh, what do you want me to do with the mail? Oh, put it on the counter.
SUPMALE:It's Mindy's.
OTHERFEMALE:This one's for you.
LEADMALE:Oh, mail for moi? It's from "The U.
LEADMALE:S.
LEADMALE:Dep Of Immig and Nat"? I don't know anyone named Nat.
SUPFEMALE:What's it say? Let me see.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, it's from the Department of Immigration and Naturalization.
SUPMALE:"Dear sir" That's nice.
OTHERMALE:"With concern to your visit April 19 last year, "we require more information on your alien status.
LEADMALE:"Please contact our office immediately to prevent termination of U.
SUPFEMALE:S.
LEADFEMALE:residency.
SUPMALE:Love, Jimmy.
LEADMALE:" I still don't know what it means.
LEADMALE:Well, it means I'm up the creek without a green card.
SUPMALE:Being grown up is sure confusing.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, little one.
LEADMALE:Last year I went to apply for an alien status, and they, well, the-they refused me, and I thought they threw away the form, but I guess they didn't.
SUPFEMALE:What's that gotta do with a creek? It means I'm gonna be deported.
LEADMALE:What's "deported" mean? It means I'll have to find another place to live.
SUPFEMALE:I better go down there and check it out right away.
LEADMALE:Careful what you say.
SUPMALE:You're right.
OTHERMALE:It's the government.
LEADFEMALE:If I try and duck any questions, they'll think I'm chicken, and my goose is cooked.
SUPMALE:I guess I'll have to prove that I'm gonna be a fine American.
SUPFEMALE:What's on the Statue of Liberty? I was there once when I was a kid.
SUPMALE:It says "Carlos loves Mary Beth Ovitz.
LEADFEMALE:" Oh, it's almost 4:00.
LEADMALE:I'd better put on some decent duds and get down to the federal courthouse.
LEADFEMALE:I'll stay here and tell Mindy where you've gone.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Carlos must really love Mary Beth.
SUPMALE:I mean, he built that big statue, and she's still carrying a torch for him.
SUPMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) Da-duh, da, dum dum dum! America, America From sea to shining Waves of grain Yay! You, uh, you must be my 5:00 appointment.
LEADMALE:I'm certainly not your 5:00 shadow.
OTHERFEMALE:Ar ar! I'm just your typical, American, patriotic citizen.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry I'm late, but I had to stop by Mom's Diner to have a piece of apple pie, a cold beer, eat a hot dog, watch a baseball game, catch a pass, join the army, move to the suburbs, and shoot a deer.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what's this in my pocket? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:It's the Constitution.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know why I carry it around, because I memorized it years ago.
LEADMALE:Mr Mr.
SUPMALE:Mork, is it? Yes, uh, yes, my fellow American, it is.
OTHERMALE:It says here you come from Ork.
LEADMALE:Where exactly is that? Follow, follow, follow, follow.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Mr.
LEADMALE:Mork, it's pretty hard for an alien to get into this country, but it's impossible for a wacky alien to get in.
SUPMALE:Ah, what about Charo? Have, uh, have you got any identification papers? Oh, no, just "Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bill" of Rights.
LEADFEMALE:( squeaking ) Oh, no! Don't violate me! Your enthusiasm is very admirable.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:And your costume is pretty spiffy.
SUPMALE:But we don't grant citizenship on personality alone.
LEADFEMALE:You can ask me anything about American history.
SUPMALE:I know all the answers.
SUPFEMALE:Who was Paul Revere's barber? Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Benedict of Boston.
OTHERMALE:Uh, I know the names of all the states.
OTHERMALE:There's anxiety, depression, fear, catatonic joy, catatonic love, catatonic peace.
SUPFEMALE:Jud told me you were here.
LEADMALE:Oh, I am.
OTHERMALE:Ye Um, excuse me for barging in like this, your honor.
LEADMALE:Are you with him, or are you normal? No, no, I'm with him.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then you could help answer a few questions.
LEADMALE:Well, I thought we cleared all these questions up last year.
SUPFEMALE:All I can tell you is his file is incomplete.
LEADMALE:If he wants to stay in the country, I have to have some more information.
SUPFEMALE:Well.
OTHERMALE:Well, my astrological sign is Nepharius, with egg rising.
LEADFEMALE:We'll start with "occupation.
SUPFEMALE:" You got a job? Absolutely.
SUPFEMALE:What is it? Well, observing a primitive planet ( Gasps ) A reasonable planet A wonderful planet.
SUPMALE:There a lot of money in that? Well, not much.
SUPFEMALE:I-I usually make my money from doing odd jobs.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, your honor, um, couldn't you just tell Mork what he has to do to stay in the country? Well, for starters, he has to bring me a passport and a birth certificate.
OTHERMALE:Now, I'll tell you what I'll do.
LEADMALE:I'll hold his file for five days.
OTHERFEMALE:But if he doesn't produce the documents by then, he'll have to be deported.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:I wonder where I left my birth certificate.
SUPMALE:Probably with my passport, huh, Mind? Yeah.
SUPMALE:( laughing ) Ar, ar! Now, if you two will excuse me, I have to take two adult-strength pain relievers.
LEADMALE:Don't you want to hear me sing "God Bless America" in harmony? Look, if you don't bring me those papers, you may be singing "God Bless Guatemala.
SUPMALE:" Um, excuse me, your honor.
LEADMALE:Uh, just on the off-chance.
LEADFEMALE:Mork can't find his passport or his birth certificate, uh, is there any other way he can stay in the country? Not unless he marries an American citizen.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:( calm theme playing ) Mork, have you changed yet? No, I'm still an illegal alien.
SUPMALE:Well, I've been thinking over the alternatives.
SUPFEMALE:Well, me too.
LEADMALE:Number one, I could run away.
LEADFEMALE:Then they'd arrest me, there'd be a brief trial, then death row, and then president Jerry Brown would strap me into a solar-powered electric chair, and it would take me a year to die.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I've been thinking.
LEADFEMALE:You could run away, but then you'd be a fugitive.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, probably be pursued for the rest of my life by a one-arm immigration officer.
LEADMALE:Or you could go to another country, except you'd have trouble getting in anywhere without a passport.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, maybe I could stay at the Charles Place.
SUPMALE:I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:I think it'd be too difficult for you to adjust to another country.
LEADMALE:Oh! And you can go with me, Mind! If we go to China, it'll be Mork and Ming.
LEADFEMALE:Or if we go to Or if we go to Siberia it'll be Mork and Mindivich.
LEADFEMALE:Or Or Italy, it'll be Mork and Mindestrone.
OTHERMALE:Or if we go to Latvia, it'll be Laverne and Shirley.
LEADMALE:No, no, work, you can't go.
LEADMALE:Well, why not? Well, 'cause I don't want to take you away from your friends your life here, your dentist.
LEADFEMALE:I've got another solution! I'll disguise myself as an American tourist.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'll get a Nikon camera, a long, two-piece leisure suit, that's okay, we'll rent some kids, we'll put them in the back, they'll wear Mickey Mouse ears and go, "Dad, are we goin' to Disneyland?" I'll be driving along, look in the rearview mirror, and go, "You shut up, and if Grandpa passes out again, you jump-start him.
LEADFEMALE:Now, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Be quiet.
OTHERMALE:" Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Mork The only thing left to do is what the judge suggested, getting married.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I couldn't do that, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why not? Well, because you once said that marriage is a very, very special thing and you only wanted to do it once.
SUPMALE:And I don't want you to waste it on a favor.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but, Mork, I'm trying to help you.
SUPMALE:Nah, it'll be all right.
LEADFEMALE:I'll leave, and you'll forget about me, and I'll forget about you In about 200 years.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we can't give up now.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, we've got five whole days to think of something.
SUPFEMALE:No, let's face it, I'm doomed.
LEADMALE:At least I have something to remember you by.
SUPFEMALE:What's that? Can I see? Oh, don't open it.
SUPMALE:What is it? Well, inside is the very first tear you ever shed for me.
LEADFEMALE:And you carry this with you? Oh, Mork, that's so nice.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I hope one day, I can If I ever get real, real lonely, I'll open it up and brush that tear away.
LEADMALE:It'll almost be like having you there.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:( knock on door ) Oh, it's probably the library, Mind.
LEADMALE:I'm overdue on that book, Raising Weasels for Fun and Profit.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, Jud.
LEADMALE:Is Mork still here? Well, he sure is.
LEADMALE:Mork, you have a visitor.
LEADMALE:Oh, rug bug, you probably just came to say goodbye, didn't you? That's not why I'm here.
LEADMALE:I saw this program on TV and I thought it might help you.
LEADMALE:It's about adopting kids from Asia.
OTHERMALE:If you could find someone to adopt you like the Vietnamese kids, you could stay in this country.
SUPMALE:( gasps ) That's a great idea! Yeah, Mind, but I'm allergic to silk and I don't love rice.
OTHERMALE:It's not so bad if you put lots of sugar on it.
LEADMALE:See ya! Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot, Jud.
SUPMALE:Sure thing! Hey, bye.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, did you hear that? All we have to do is find an American who'll adopt you, and then you can stay in the country! Yeah, but who's gonna adopt me? Me? ( upbeat theme playing ) Let's see, adoption agency Adoption agency.
SUPMALE:Uh, Mind Can you stop your fingers from walking for a second and let my lips do the talking? I mean, I don't think this is a very good idea.
SUPFEMALE:Why, Mork? I'll adopt you, and then everything Then you'll become my mother.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:You see, I already have a mother back on Ork.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, if And if you adopt me, it'll break her little Pyrex heart.
LEADMALE:All right, then we'll have to find someone else who'll adopt you.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, kids.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley! Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you for remembering.
LEADFEMALE:Mind if I borrow a cup of Sweet'N Low? Oh, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley, why don't you come in and sit down? We have something we'd like to talk to you about.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:Why shouldn't I share the wisdom of my years? Bick, we're just wondering, what's your opinion about adoption? I'm for it.
LEADFEMALE:It gives a guy an excuse to watch the Saturday morning cartoons.
SUPMALE:See, we feel that a new son could really bring joy into one's life.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I get it now, you're thinking about adopting a little boy.
LEADMALE:I think it's nice.
LEADMALE:You get the kid of your choice and the child gets parents who love him and want him.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody wins.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so However, before you do anything, let Uncle Bick give you a little advice.
SUPMALE:If possible, find out everything you can about his background: Who his parents were, where he came from, and if he's had his shots.
OTHERFEMALE:You'd want to ask these questions if you were adopting someone? I'd want to ask those questions if I was hiring a gardener.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thanks for the advice.
SUPMALE:Oh, sorry.
LEADMALE:We're out of Sweet'N Low.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, you might as well hold onto this till you get some.
LEADFEMALE:It's yours.
LEADMALE:I borrowed it last year.
LEADMALE:By the way, if you do get a kid and you need a babysitter, just drop him by my place.
OTHERFEMALE:You can use that window over there.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye, Mork, bye-bye, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, America.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:That's all right, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I'd probably be too big for his lap anyway.
LEADFEMALE:What we have to find is someone who will adopt you that won't ask any questions about your past.
LEADMALE:Well, just hope it's not Roy Rogers, 'cause if I pass on, he'll have me stuffed and put in his museum.
LEADFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) I'm so excited.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Where's the little one? You're looking at him.
LEADFEMALE:You're here to be adopted? Oh, t-the bigger ones are always the last to go.
LEADFEMALE:You mean you're adopting him? Oh, no, no.
OTHERMALE:Not me.
SUPMALE:( door opens ) Would you put that thing away? There are ladies present! Exidor! Son! Is that you? Dad! Morkie! Here's the present I got you.
LEADMALE:You left it in the other office.
LEADFEMALE:Careful, it's still got its claws! You're the best dad in the whole world.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, yes.
SUPMALE:I think I'll just take this for now.
LEADMALE:Exidor, we really can't thank you enough for doing this.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd do anything for this waif Even dress up in this ridiculous outfit.
LEADFEMALE:Exidor, Mork has passed every other interview.
SUPFEMALE:Now, this one's the big one.
LEADFEMALE:Now, do you remember what you're supposed to do? Certainly.
LEADFEMALE:I'm to be dignified, respectful And just as crazy as the rest of the people in this world.
LEADFEMALE:Well, do you think you can do that? Oh, sure.
SUPMALE:I'm great at impressions.
LEADMALE:Uh, watch this! Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Lovely day.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Charming child! Why, thank you! Madcap enough? Monrax, don't chew on that lady's skirt! Lucky for you polyester doesn't fray.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, I think we're in trouble.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Exidor.
SUPMALE:That's you! Good luck! Thanks, Min.
OTHERMALE:Uh, Exidor Now, don't talk too much, and just try and play it cool, all right? Cool as a night in Siberia.
OTHERFEMALE:Steinmatz, wash that before you put it in your mouth! Lovely day, isn't it? Uh, yes.
SUPFEMALE:Now, who is adopting whom? I'm Mr.
LEADMALE:Mork, and this is my father-to-be, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Exidor.
OTHERFEMALE:I see.
SUPMALE:I have the papers here of your interviews today, but essentially, the question of adoption rests on this meeting.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Exidor, do you have your references with you? They're in the briefcase.
SUPMALE:Oh, they're in the briefcase.
LEADFEMALE:Lunch! It says here that you're a doctor of philosophy, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Dr.
OTHERFEMALE:Exidor And that you studied with Spinoza.
OTHERFEMALE:He's been dead for many years.
LEADFEMALE:No wonder I never got my report card! Um, he means Mel Spinoza, it's his friend from Harvard.
LEADFEMALE:It was just a little joke.
OTHERFEMALE:This is not a place for levity.
LEADFEMALE:Doctor, it could cost you a son.
SUPMALE:Of course.
LEADFEMALE:Dr.
LEADMALE:Exidor, the key question is, why do you want to adopt someone as old as Mork? Why? My dear lady, where is it written that a person is not entitled to love after a certain age? What you see before you are two people with complementary needs.
LEADMALE:He to have a father, I to be one.
LEADFEMALE:What calloused heart would deny the fulfillment of this just because one of us isn't wearing diapers? You really do love each other, don't you? Oh! She bought it! Dr.
OTHERMALE:Exidor, I had my doubts, but you're a fine man.
OTHERMALE:You have a son! Junior! Mon cher Papa! Take these papers to be notarized and bring them back here.
OTHERMALE:Your wish is my command! We did it! Exidor, you were brilliant.
LEADFEMALE:If we could bag what I just said over there, we could double the corn crop in Kansas! Wait a minute! Be careful with those papers.
LEADMALE:Those are the only ones we have.
OTHERMALE:Don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:Pepe, don't throw that Frisbee in here! ( upbeat theme playing ) And then I couldn't believe it when he said Mork! ( imitating Exidor ) Mindy, is that you? Will you cut it out? ( Normal voice ) I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Just trying to be a chip off the old pop.
LEADMALE:You know, Ex I mean, Dad's been awfully nice to me.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, he even put me in his will.
OTHERFEMALE:Before, he was gonna leave everything to his burro.
SUPMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:And what are you gonna inherit? A bale of hay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he was gonna leave me the Colorado River, but I said I had no place to put it.
LEADMALE:You know, Mork, uh, we solved one problem, but I'm afraid we might have another one.
LEADMALE:I've been thinking, and for the first time, the government actually has records on you.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think so, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:See, the Immigration Department closed its files on me, and Dad didn't trust the Adoption Bureau.
LEADFEMALE:He said he'd put them in his private vault.
SUPMALE:Exidor has a vault? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:It's behind Herman's House of Fish in a dumpster.
LEADMALE:It looks like you're safe for a while, anyway.
SUPMALE:You know, Mind, we got real close to being married, didn't we? Yeah, we did.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder what that would have been like.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:and Mrs.
LEADMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let's see, you know, after a while, I'd I'd come home, open the door and go, ( imitating Ozzie Nelson ) "Hi, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Dave.
LEADMALE:Hi, Rick.
LEADMALE:" ( imitating Ricky Nelson ) "Oh, wow.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dad.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:"You look really good tonight.
LEADFEMALE:It's really nice to have you home.
LEADFEMALE:" ( Normal voice ) Then I-I'd sit in front of Of the TV on Sundays with a little six-pack of ginger ale.
LEADMALE:And I'd sit there for a long time, and eventually, after a couple years, I get a little ginger belly.
LEADMALE:Then we'd have to buy lots of aspirin for all the headaches you'd get at night.
LEADFEMALE:And then eventually ( imitating old man ) We'd get a lot older, and we'd sit out on the front porch in our little, motorized rocking chairs, and the chairs would rock for us.
LEADFEMALE:Every so often, I'd flip my little pacemaker up real fast like that and turn it down.
LEADMALE:And then, finally, one day, I'd lean over to you.
LEADFEMALE:Take me about an hour to get real close, and then I'd lean over and whisper in your hearing aid, I'd say, "Mindy "After all these years you've been so nice to me, "I'm gonna tell you something that no one else knows.
SUPFEMALE:I'm really a Ah!" Mork! ( upbeat theme playing ) Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, your goodyear-ship! ORSON: I'm here, Mork.
OTHERMALE:What do you have to report? Well, I had a close call, your high-and-wideness.
LEADMALE:I was almost banned from the country.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you couldn't stay there, why didn't you move to another country? Oh, easier said than done, sir.
LEADMALE:You see, the borders are guarded by an incredible obstacle known as red tape.
SUPMALE:Besides, I've grown accustomed to this place, and And to Mindy's face.
LEADFEMALE:But are you welcome to remain there? Well, sir, all I know is there's this lady who's carrying a torch for me who keeps saying, ( imitating Mae West ) "Send me your tired, your poor, and your huddled masses.
SUPMALE:" A noble sentiment.
SUPMALE:Yes, except there's also a man down at the immigration office who says, "Not too tired, not too poor, and not too many.
LEADFEMALE:" How did you convince them to let you stay? Well, I had to be adopted.
SUPMALE:You see, adoption is an Earth custom that allows humans who like being parents to find others who need them.
LEADFEMALE:It's kind of like an emotional swap meet.
SUPMALE:Do the Earthlings get a reward for adopting? All I know, sir, is their lives are richer for having done it.
LEADMALE:You see, that's how this country was founded, by adopting people from other nations.
SUPFEMALE:( Scandinavian accent ) First, a few Vikings.
OTHERMALE:( Spanish accent ) Then, some Spaniards.
OTHERFEMALE:( British accent ) Then, some Englishmen.
SUPMALE:( African accent ) Then, some Africans.
LEADMALE:( Oriental accent ) Some Orientals.
SUPMALE:( Irish accent ) Some Irish.
SUPFEMALE:( Eastern European accent ) And some Eastern Europeans.
LEADFEMALE:( Normal voice ) And before you know it, Orson, Good Griffith, you've got the birth of a nation! Until next week, sir, nanu, nanu.
SUPMALE:( imitating snare drum ) ( whistles patriotic melody ) ( imitating Native American chant ) Hey, what about us, hmm? Wash day.
LEADMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu! ( upbeat theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Min? Oh, Min? Min? Min? Hi.
SUPMALE:I'm just filing my nails.
OTHERMALE:Well, I bet you file them under N, huh? Well, I have a little surprise for you.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:What's that? Let me show you.
OTHERMALE:This here.
OTHERMALE:Heh-heh-heh.
LEADMALE:What is that? ( grunts ) Well, it's the tinfoil collection of the kids at the daycare center.
LEADMALE:( chuckles ) Kind of looks like a meteor from the planet Alcoa, doesn't it? ( giggles ) Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I can't think of a better job for you than being a group leader for a bunch of kids.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I am kind of an expert in the field.
LEADMALE:Would you believe this? Some people say I'm rather childlike myself.
SUPMALE:( chuckles ) Well, that's news.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:( knocking on door ) Race you! Ha-ha-ha! Hello, Mork.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Hi, Nelson.
LEADMALE:Nice ball of tin.
LEADFEMALE:May I take your coat? I've always liked it.
LEADMALE:Ar-ar.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Well, some, uh, interesting development has transpired, and I'm proud as a peahen.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna give a speech on television.
LEADMALE:( gasps ) You're kidding! That's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:I've worked very, very hard on it, and I, uh, wanted to get your reactions to it, what you think about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Well, it looks nice from here.
LEADMALE:Nice crease.
SUPMALE:A little albino origami, huh? I think he wants to read it to us, Mork.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, dopey moi.
SUPMALE:Okay, go ahead, Nelson.
SUPFEMALE:( clears throat ) "What has happened to America? "People have been asking that question a lot lately.
SUPFEMALE:"That's why I've decided to look for a solution.
LEADFEMALE:"You see, I sense that if there were a solution, "or solutions, "the energy that went into asking that question "could be channeled into the search for other solutions to other questions.
LEADMALE:" ( snoring ) MINDY: Mork! That was my grabber.
LEADMALE:( gasps ) Oh.
LEADMALE:Bravo.
LEADMALE:Author, author.
SUPMALE:I just Just started.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Um, how much longer is that? It runs for a full hour.
SUPMALE:Want me to read faster? You got a full hour on television? Well, my, uh, opponents in the upcoming election were on a televised debate.
SUPFEMALE:Somehow I was snubbed.
LEADFEMALE:I suspect that the station manager is like this with the other 12 candidates.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:So you got equal time from the FCC? Mind, you don't have to spell it.
OTHERFEMALE:We're all adults here.
OTHERMALE:The only snag is Is that, uh, they gave me 7:00 Saturday morning.
SUPMALE:Not exactly a prime-o time-o.
LEADFEMALE:Not exactly? There's nobody watching TV except kids.
SUPFEMALE:I'm hoping that they like what I say about America and how to fix her, and then they'll tell their parents to vote for me.
LEADFEMALE:Nelson, I don't think that a political speech is exactly what kids want to listen to.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you could always do it in a chicken suit.
OTHERFEMALE:If you want the kids to pay attention to you, you've got to talk about something they're interested in.
LEADMALE:I don't know what kids want to hear.
LEADMALE:Hang, it's been years since I was a cute little tyke.
LEADMALE:Tell you what.
OTHERMALE:I can help you out.
LEADMALE:I could go to the daycare center and ask the tykes and tykettes what they want to see on Saturday morning besides, ( high-pitched voice ): "Yah! Whoa!" ( as Porky Pig ): "Ba-dee-ba-dee-ba-dee-ba-dee, that's all folks.
LEADFEMALE:" I appreciate that, Mork.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot.
SUPMALE:Mindy, don't let him go.
LEADMALE:He's one special guy.
OTHERMALE:Yes, he is.
SUPFEMALE:Well, see you later, Nelson.
SUPMALE:Okay, see you guys later.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Ta-ta.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mind, I was gonna take that up to the attic, unless you would like it as a little knickknack or a tchotchke.
LEADMALE:Well, Mork, my knickknack shelf has a one-ton weight limit.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna know how you'll get that upstairs.
LEADMALE:It was no trouble bringing it home.
SUPMALE:Well, not exactly no trouble.
LEADMALE:You know that taco stand at the bottom of that real steep hill? Yes.
SUPMALE:Well, it has a drive-through service now.
SUPFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) That's a nice pinecone turkey you're making, Grant.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Thompson.
SUPMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Thompson, can you jump sideways in checkers? No, Pamela.
LEADMALE:Shazbat! Well, Jack, this is an interesting painting.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what it is? A tree.
LEADMALE:It's a picture of you.
SUPFEMALE:You know, it does sort of look like me, except for that branch growing out of my ear.
SUPFEMALE:I knew you'd like it.
OTHERFEMALE:( giggles ) Greetings, munchkins.
LEADMALE:ALL: Nanu, nanu! Aw, shucks and wazoo.
SUPMALE:( laughs ) The kids sure have taken to you, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I like them too.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to rent one if I could.
OTHERFEMALE:I also feel good about helping working moms.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll be in my office.
LEADMALE:Have fun.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Picasso, eh? Mork, would you do that magic trick again? ALL: Yeah! All right, no pressure.
LEADFEMALE:( imitates band playing fanfare music ) ( gurgling ) ( burps ) I can drink like that.
LEADFEMALE:You can? Yes, but I do it with my mouth.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sleight of tongue, eh? Munchkins, I-I need your help.
LEADMALE:I have to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.
LEADMALE:See, I have this friend who's giving a speech on Saturday-morning television.
SUPFEMALE:He likes to know what you think What would you like him to say? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, we get enough speeches at home.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what would you like to see on Saturday mornings? The Dallas cheerleaders.
OTHERMALE:I like puppets.
SUPMALE:I like jokes.
LEADMALE:Rock 'n' roll! I'd like to see Dick Cavett interview the prime minister of Rhodesia.
LEADFEMALE:Pardon me? I can't help it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gifted.
LEADMALE:I wanna find out where babies come from.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you find out, will you tell me? ( upbeat theme playing ) They also want to see you juggle, and some magic, lion taming.
LEADMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:You have a talent.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't do nary a thing on that list.
LEADMALE:Nelson was never what you might call the entertainer of the family.
LEADFEMALE:Last time I got applause is when I used the potty without being reminded.
LEADFEMALE:I think I just better go with my strength: Dull speeches.
OTHERFEMALE:The little rug rats don't want to watch me, let 'em switch to Mooky the Mongoose.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to fill this entire hour by yourself, do you? What are you driving at? Well, maybe we could help.
LEADMALE:I mean, we've got friends.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I know some guys in a band and And Remo tells jokes.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, Mindy can sing.
LEADFEMALE:And Jeanie dances.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to us.
SUPMALE:We sound like an old Judy Garland/ Mickey Rooney movie.
OTHERFEMALE:( as Mickey Rooney ): Kids, let's put on a show! With a little imagination, we could turn the new theater into an old barn! I don't know.
OTHERMALE:It sounds kind of wacky.
SUPMALE:Who'd want to watch a bunch of amateurs put on a show? Peeping Toms.
LEADMALE:I guess it is kind of a silly idea.
LEADMALE:What am I gonna do? Come on, Nelson, you can't give up.
LEADMALE:Mind, we've got to help him.
SUPMALE:Nelson, you might not have to be that professional at 7 in the morning.
SUPMALE:Do you really think if I put on a kids' show, people would like me? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe.
LEADMALE:By gum, let's do it.
SUPMALE:It'll be Nelson Flavor's gift to the children of Boulder.
LEADMALE:Oh, huzzah, huzzah! Let's go for the gusto! I can see Oh, there's There's one problem.
LEADMALE:What? Well, I'll miss Mooky the Mongoose.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you.
SUPMALE:You nutty guy! ( upbeat theme playing ) MINDY: Okay, who wants to go next? Well, I'll give it a try.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Whoo.
LEADFEMALE:Yea! I learned to juggle in the Army.
SUPMALE:I used to do this with hand grenades.
LEADFEMALE:That's how I got out.
LEADFEMALE:( all laugh ) La-la-la ( all laugh ) This could be the start of something small.
LEADFEMALE:I think the audience will enjoy it.
SUPFEMALE:What audience? I invited the kids from the daycare center.
OTHERFEMALE:I hope you don't mind, Nelson.
SUPMALE:Ah, that's okay.
LEADMALE:What's wrong, Nelson? Well, it's just that everybody's got something nifty to do except me.
LEADFEMALE:If it goes well, the kids will think you're the next best thing to dead bugs.
LEADFEMALE:You're a good buddy, Mork.
LEADMALE:I'm glad I appointed you to be the host.
LEADFEMALE:Mork is gonna host the entire hour? Well, he has a firm grasp of juvenile-attitude preference.
LEADFEMALE:He means Mork knows what kids like.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I think they'll like what I'm doing.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna start it like this.
SUPMALE:( humming Fred Rogers' "Won't You Be My Neighbor?" ) ( as Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Rogers ): Have a beautiful day Have a wonderful day Hello, neighbors.

SUPFEMALE:Our graphics courtesy of the Pinetree Daycare Center.
LEADFEMALE:ALL: Yea! I'm talking about Nelson Flavor, a man of substance.

LEADFEMALE:I don't care.
SUPMALE:I wanna drown my sorrows.

LEADMALE:Oh, there's Your Humpty Dumptyness.
LEADMALE:ORSON: Just give me your report, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:( normal voice ): Yes, sir.
LEADMALE:This week, sir, I learned about teamwork.
LEADFEMALE:My friend Nelson Flavor asked for an hour of television time, but once he got it, he didn't know what to do with it, so his friends and I had to bail him out.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me, how did you help your friend? Well, I hosted his television show.
SUPFEMALE:You know, like: ( Hums theme from The Tonight Show ) And, uh, it was for children.
LEADMALE:They really seemed to enjoy it.
OTHERFEMALE:Children? Sir.
LEADMALE:What do you know about children, Mork? Well, sir, some people think of them as children, but I prefer to think of them as humans.
LEADFEMALE:There's an older phrase, sir, that says, "Children should be seen and not heard.
LEADMALE:" But I think if that really happened, the silence would be deafening.
LEADFEMALE:But children's minds aren't fully developed yet.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't it best they be kept in their place? Sir.
SUPFEMALE:Just because they're children doesn't mean they don't have anything of value to say.
LEADMALE:I mean, give 'em a chance.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to them.
OTHERMALE:If you're only gonna talk down to them, how can you expect them to look up to you? Well, sir, until next week, ( as Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Rogers ): Can you say, "Nanu, nanu"? I think you can.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu! ( upbeat theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) ( knock ) Come on in, Jeanie.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:You want something to eat before we go? Oh, no, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you're not gonna believe this, but Remo made breakfast for me in bed this morning.
LEADMALE:Mork did that for me once.
LEADMALE:It was a real surprise sliding under the covers and into a bowl of oatmeal.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! ( mumbles ) What was that? MINDY ( gasps ): Oh, no! JEANIE: Your teeth are gone.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, no.
LEADMALE:This is just paper.
OTHERMALE:I just wanted to look like all the other hockey players.
SUPFEMALE:So how'd you enjoy your first game? Well, it was kind of strange.
LEADMALE:As near as I can figure out, the object of the game is to wait until the referee drops the puck on the ice and hit the guy next to you.
LEADMALE:Then you skate around for two hours, trip people till you get a stick through the skull.
SUPFEMALE:I'd love to stay around here and swap a lot of jock stories, but I've got a job interview to get ready for.
SUPFEMALE:( both chuckle ) Maybe they'll make me a congressman.
LEADFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) I wonder where Mork is.
SUPFEMALE:He was supposed to meet me here over a half an hour ago.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I hope that means he's found a job.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what kind of job is he looking for? Anything that'll pay him enough to live on.
SUPFEMALE:He's looking in the wrong country.
LEADMALE:Ta-da! Presenting the first official Remo DaVinci wedding cake.
SUPMALE:Remo, that's really nice.
LEADFEMALE:It's for the reception here tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Note the unique corkscrew construction.
LEADFEMALE:"Why?" you may ask.
LEADMALE:Allow me to demonstrate.
LEADFEMALE:VoilÃ ! Do you dig the symbolism? I'm not quite sure.
OTHERMALE:Marriage is like a ride down a wedding cake.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you might be educated.
LEADMALE:I'm deep.
LEADFEMALE:Remo, it's just that I think it's a little silly to have a wedding reception in a delicatessen.
OTHERFEMALE:I want people to look upon me as more than a tongue-and-tuna man.
SUPFEMALE:This is our chance to be a class operation.
OTHERFEMALE:I never heard that one on Fantasy Island.
SUPMALE:Come on and I'll help you decorate the Betty Crocker Speedway.
LEADFEMALE:How would you like you tongue depressed? How would you like a knackwurst up your nose? MINDY: Mork, what happened? Mindy, you don't want to talk to me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm spider spit.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm I'm not fit to oil your Olay.
SUPMALE:You didn't get the job.
LEADMALE:No, it was worse.
OTHERMALE:I got it.
SUPFEMALE:But then I Then I lost it because of my suspenders.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? There were 32 little homicidal midgets masquerading as children.
LEADFEMALE:They bit me in places I can't even reach.
LEADFEMALE:Well, where did you get all the green paint? Never play leapfrog with a child who's into realism.
LEADFEMALE:What does this all have to do with your suspenders? Well, I left them wrapped around his little head.
OTHERMALE:As I left, I saw him going: ( In high-pitched voice ): "Help me! Help me!" Well, I'm sorry you had such a rough day.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, what's the matter with me? I There's gotta be something I can do.
LEADFEMALE:There's gotta be a job.
LEADFEMALE:I know it.
LEADFEMALE:Dressed like this, I could be a punk comedian.
SUPFEMALE:Knock-knock.
SUPMALE:Who's there? Who cares? Ha-ha-ha! Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:Don't give up.
LEADFEMALE:I know there's a job out there somewhere.
LEADFEMALE:There's got to be.
LEADMALE:Uh-uh, uh-uh.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, is Mr.
LEADFEMALE:DaVinci here? Oh, yes, he is, Father.
OTHERMALE:He's in the back.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Why do you call him "Father"? Well, because everyone calls him Father.
LEADMALE:Boy, he must be a real busy guy.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No, Mork.
LEADMALE:He's with the Church.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, as a priest.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, his job is to help people.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, maybe he can get me some paint remover.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry about a thing, Father.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna provide the best possible wedding reception for the future Winslows.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I just want to make sure they don't start their marriage off on the wrong foot.
SUPFEMALE:Just leave everything to Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Remo of Boulder.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna create the perfect nuptial atmosphere.
SUPFEMALE:See these salamis back here? PRIEST: Mm-hm.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna hang bells on them.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm gonna have this big Cupid come down from the ceiling.
LEADFEMALE:Fully dressed, Father.
LEADFEMALE:Fully dressed.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yes, uh, well, you better do your best.
OTHERMALE:Don't force me to make any threatening prayers.
SUPMALE:Got you, Padre.
LEADMALE:Got you.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, everyone.
LEADMALE:Father? Ah, how do you do? I'm Father Denny.
SUPMALE:I'm Mork, the screwup.
LEADMALE:Is it true that you help people? Well, I try to help people.
OTHERMALE:Why, do you have a problem? Um, excuse me, Father, but Mork's depressed because he can't hold a job.
SUPFEMALE:And he feels like a loser.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, how do you think I felt when TIME magazine announced that, uh, God was dead? Of course, it just turned out to be a rumor after all.
LEADFEMALE:Well, is there any way you can help me, Father? Well, I could give you a bit of advice.
LEADMALE:When you're standing there at home plate, it doesn't matter whether you're a slugger or a bunter.
LEADFEMALE:You've got to lean into the ball.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Father.
LEADFEMALE:That kind of helps.
SUPMALE:That's from my sermon to the newlyweds.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, now, uh, do you really want to work? Oh, yes, sir.
LEADMALE:I don't want to be a hickey on the neck of life.
SUPFEMALE:That's very poetic, Mork.
LEADMALE:Uh Remo.
SUPMALE:Yes, Father? Why don't you give this boy a job? ( laughing ): You mean Mork? Look, I love him, Father.
OTHERFEMALE:I I really love him, but, um, the last time I asked him to help me, he used the exhaust fan to slice bologna.
SUPFEMALE:I had sandwiches three blocks away.
LEADMALE:Well, uh, could you just, uh, give him something to do for the reception? You'd be helping him a lot.
LEADMALE:I think I remember hearing that God helps those who help themselves.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe you also heard that he can be a little rough on those that don't help others.
LEADMALE:You get my drift? Oh, I get it.
SUPFEMALE:He's gonna make me an offer I can't refuse.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ): Right.
LEADMALE:Knife.
SUPMALE:Knife.
OTHERFEMALE:Fork.
LEADFEMALE:Fork.
LEADMALE:Mayo.
OTHERFEMALE:Mayo.
LEADMALE:Mork? Hold the mayo.
LEADMALE:Did you take out the garbage like I asked you? No, the roaches aren't finished with it yet.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Oh, I'm classing the joint up so that Father Denny doesn't put a curse on me.
OTHERMALE:Oh, he's into voodoo.
LEADFEMALE:I know about that.
LEADFEMALE:( chants ) ( in high voice ): The drums, they make me sweat.
LEADMALE:( in normal voice ): Shut up and drink your quinine.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ) Oh, how you doing, fellas? REMO: Hi, Father.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I really like what you've done with the place.
LEADMALE:Really, Father? No, not really.
OTHERMALE:Actually, a priest has to kind of fib every now and then too.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, Father.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's gonna be all right because I'm in charge of les dÃ©corations.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what do you have in mind? Let me show you.
OTHERMALE:It's my amazing, new creation.
SUPFEMALE:It's a centerpiece, carved completely out of chopped liver, of the bride and groom.
SUPFEMALE:Do you like where I put the pickle? Nobody's ever asked me that question before.
LEADMALE:Laurie, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be married in two hours.
LEADMALE:That's what I want to talk to you about.
SUPMALE:This is amazing.
SUPFEMALE:I can see her clear as day.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? You can't see the bride before she's married.
LEADFEMALE:Father, I'm getting cold feet.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you can use my socks if you want.
LEADMALE:Father, I don't know if If I want to give up my freedom.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, let's sit down over here and discuss this, all right? Here.
SUPFEMALE:Take a seat.
OTHERMALE:Now ( upbeat theme playing ) Pace, pace, pace, pace.
OTHERFEMALE:Ecap, ecap, ecap, ecap.
LEADMALE:Pace, pace, pace Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you're finally home.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry I'm late.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted to buy a few things and I lost track of time.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Did you miss me? No, but I have some really exciting news for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me your news.
LEADFEMALE:No, you tell me your news first.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have any news.
OTHERMALE:Why do I have to do everything around here? Mork, your news? All right.
LEADMALE:I've decided what I want to do with my life.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's the spirit.
SUPMALE:Close.
LEADFEMALE:I want to be a priest.
SUPMALE:That's ludicrous.
LEADMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:Isn't it wonderful? After seeing Father Denny yesterday, I realized what I really want to do.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Well, because I want to celebrate.
SUPMALE:Celebrate what? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Whatever Father Denny celebrates.
SUPMALE:Mork, Father Denny didn't say he celebrates.
LEADFEMALE:He said he's celibate.
SUPMALE:What's that mean? It means that he's married to the Church.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're gonna tell me that? Wow, where's he gonna get a ring that big, huh? Mork, you can't be a priest.
LEADMALE:Why not, Mindy? They do what I want to do.
LEADMALE:They help people, they solve problems, they play bingo.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but, Mork, sometimes those problems are a matter of life and death, and a priest can only deal with them through his faith.
LEADMALE:Look, Mork, tomorrow morning, I'll take you to the church myself, and Father Denny will explain to you why you can't become a priest.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy, don't you see all the advantages of it, though? You get to wear a black habit.
LEADMALE:I can dress up like Johnny Cash.
SUPFEMALE:( imitating Johnny Cash ): Hi, I'm Father Mork.
LEADFEMALE:( normal voice ): Besides, I've seen all the movies about priests.
LEADMALE:"Tommy, give me that gun you meshugenah.
LEADMALE:Put it down.
LEADFEMALE:" And there's And there's no such thing as a bad boy.
SUPFEMALE:Only great girls.
SUPFEMALE:And besides, it It's part of a worldwide franchise.
LEADMALE:Just look for the golden steeple.
LEADMALE:Over 8 billion souls.
SUPFEMALE:There's great possibilities.
OTHERFEMALE:A little puff of smoke, and there's no place like Rome, there's no place like Rome.
LEADFEMALE:There I am on the Vatican.
LEADMALE:( imitates crowd cheering ) ( imitating Latin ) Play ball! ( upbeat theme playing ) Oh, this place is wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Real beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:The windows don't match, but it's still neat.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't they know there's an energy crisis? They're wasting precious wax, here.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, great place for an echo.
LEADMALE:Hello! Excuse me, Father.
OTHERMALE:You shouldn't be yelling in church.
LEADMALE:Why not? It's a great echo.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, I have to talk to you, Father.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't call me Father.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be so formal.
LEADFEMALE:Call me Pops.
LEADMALE:Okay, Pops, um I've got kind of a problem.
LEADMALE:Well, tell me your problem.
LEADMALE:Perhaps we can solve it.
LEADFEMALE:I've been sitting over there in that pew, and The first thing you have to do is move to a cleaner seat.
SUPFEMALE:I was kind of thinking about the things I've been writing on the bus-station walls.
LEADMALE:Oh, I've seen some of your stuff.
LEADFEMALE:I really enjoy it.
LEADMALE:"Gate 13," "Ladies," and "The Marines are looking for a few good men.
SUPFEMALE:" I think somebody else writes that stuff.
SUPMALE:The things I write are more along the lines of, uh ( whispers ) Oh, there should be flies buzzing around you.
OTHERMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:What I don't know is how I can be forgiven.
SUPMALE:Well, first of all, you have to start all over again.
SUPFEMALE:Erase that stuff and put something people want to read, like, "Nuclear energy cures acne," or "Frank Sinatra's made his last comeback.
LEADMALE:" Yeah, I'll do that right away.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Fath Uh, Pops.
LEADFEMALE:Well, excuse me, son.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you know where I can find Father Denny? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:He can't be here all the time.
SUPFEMALE:I think it's his disco night.
LEADMALE:I guess I better call him at home then.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Now, let's see.
SUPFEMALE:Where's the phone? Oh, excuse me please, Father.
LEADFEMALE:What can I do for you, my son? Well, you must be the new priest.
OTHERMALE:My, aren't you awfully young.
LEADMALE:Well, come back in a year, I'll be a little older.
LEADMALE:Ar-ar! Bless you, Father.
SUPMALE:Bless you.
SUPMALE:Bless you.
SUPMALE:Bless you.
SUPMALE:Bless you, Father.
LEADMALE:Bless you.
OTHERMALE:Bless you.
OTHERMALE:MORK: Bless you! Let's see.
LEADMALE:Go to the phone.
LEADFEMALE:No dime.
LEADFEMALE:( mumbles ) Thank you.
LEADMALE:Now, let's see Whoa! You'd think this was New York.
SUPFEMALE:Somebody ripped off the phone! MORK: It's so dark.
LEADFEMALE:I can't see You did what with whom? Hey, wait, hold on.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute! I got a story for you.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, come back! Hey, wait.
OTHERMALE:It's a story.
LEADFEMALE:It's a great joke.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on Hey, I listened to your story.
LEADMALE:MORK: Wait.
SUPMALE:Must be a full moon.
LEADMALE:Here you are.
LEADMALE:I I need a priest to give the last rites.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this is a democracy.
LEADFEMALE:You always have rights, as long as you vote.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You act like you don't know what last rites are.
LEADMALE:Oh, of course, I do, my son.
SUPFEMALE:Last rites is when you add the fabric softener.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:That's the last rinse.
SUPFEMALE:First it was funny newscasters, now it's funny priests.
SUPMALE:Last rites is what a priest says when someone is dying.
LEADMALE:Someone's dying? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Me.
SUPFEMALE:From what? From suicide.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna kill myself.
LEADFEMALE:Why? I have nothing to live for.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you realize that living is a precious thing? It's the meat in the sandwich of life.
LEADMALE:It's my life.
LEADFEMALE:I can have it here or to go.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess it's bad taste to say good luck, so ciao.
LEADMALE:Hey, a-a-aren't you even gonna try to talk me out of it? Why? You said it was your life.
SUPFEMALE:I guess all you have to do is go up to the plate of life and bunt.
SUPMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Well, I stand here and tell you I'm gonna kill myself, and you don't even try to help me.
OTHERMALE:You want help? All right.
SUPMALE:I It doesn't sound like the right thing, but I'll give you some help.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down, my son.
LEADMALE:Well, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:You have to kill yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Here's a good way.
SUPFEMALE:Wear a tutu and go into a leather bar.
SUPMALE:Oh, here's another one.
LEADFEMALE:Here's another one.
LEADFEMALE:You try and smoke a real camel.
SUPMALE:I knew I should have gone to St.
LEADMALE:Paul's.
LEADMALE:No, no, here's a really good one.
SUPMALE:You go upstairs and hang in the big church bell.
OTHERFEMALE:I go and play "Jingle Bells.
LEADFEMALE:" By the time I get to "in a one-horse open sleigh," you're a dead ringer.
SUPFEMALE:No, wait! Why don't you try and slip into a pair of water moccasins? Let me out of here.
SUPMALE:DÃ©jÃ  pew.
SUPFEMALE:( mellow theme playing ) What are you doing dressed like that? Well, I happened to run into a Jesuit garage sale.
LEADMALE:Well, actually, Mindy, I just want to be dressed correctly when we go to see Father Denny.
SUPMALE:Somehow I don't think that's appropriate.
SUPMALE:Well, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Basic black is a little plain.
OTHERMALE:Can I borrow your pearls? Look, Mork, I don't mind going to the church with you this morning, but I really wish you'd try and dress like a normal person and just try to fit in.
LEADFEMALE:I fit in last night.
SUPMALE:What do you mean you fit in last night? Oh, dopey me.
LEADMALE:You went to St.
SUPFEMALE:Peter's last night like that? Yes, but it's all right, though.
SUPMALE:I I helped this man to commit suicide.
LEADFEMALE:You what? Well, he He didn't know how to do it, so I gave him 50 ways to meet his maker.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You might have really done it this time.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna go see Father Denny.
LEADMALE:( dramatic theme playing ) Ah, good morning, Mindy and Father Mork? Uh, Father Denny, Mork has a confession to make.
LEADFEMALE:Confession.
LEADMALE:Well, uh, would you like to step into my office? I was in there last night.
LEADMALE:You should know someone ripped off your phone.
SUPMALE:You were here last night? Were you dressed like that? Well, that's kind of what he wants to confess.
OTHERMALE:Well, um, I want to be a priest.
SUPMALE:You want to be a priest? Do you think you have a genuine calling? No, just a black dress.
LEADMALE:But I came in here last night to apply for a job and I was trying to fill out the application, and people started coming to me for help.
LEADMALE:Uh, well, you see, ahem, I guess, apparently, last night, someone came in on the verge of suicide and Suicide? What was his name? What did he look like? I don't commit to memory people who are not gonna make it.
SUPFEMALE:Do you realize you could've been the cause of someone's death just because you wanted to play priest? I wanted to be a priest just like you.
LEADFEMALE:But I've spent six years studying to be a priest.
LEADMALE:Look, son, it's no sin to be a nitwit.
OTHERMALE:But if you're gonna go around giving out counsel and advice without the tools of education and experience, you could do more harm than good.
LEADFEMALE:All right, you've done something unforgivable.
SUPMALE:There's no excuse.
LEADMALE:I want you to get in there and take that cassock off right now.
LEADMALE:With all these buttons in the dark? Go! Well, hasn't the Church ever heard of a zipper? Oh! I'm really sorry about this, Father Denny.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that Mork is so impressionable, and he really did want to be a priest.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:I'm looking for the young priest who was on duty here last night.
LEADMALE:Uh, he's, uh, no longer with St.
OTHERFEMALE:Peter's.
LEADMALE:Uh, yeah, he was only a temporary.
SUPFEMALE:They have temporary priests? Sure, they're kind of like Kelly Girls, only they carry rosary beads instead of little white gloves.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Well, I I wish he were here, because I wanted to thank him for saving my life.
LEADFEMALE:He saved your life? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I came in here last night all ready to commit suicide.
LEADFEMALE:I never expected a priest to give me advice on how to kill myself.
SUPMALE:It was the one thing I wasn't prepared for.
SUPFEMALE:Well, how do you feel about suicide now? Oh, suicide's no answer.
SUPMALE:And he made me realize just how foolish I was being.
LEADMALE:No kidding? If you ever see him again, please tell him that he's a He's a great priest and a wonderful judge of human nature.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, you tried your best to throw that man out at the plate, but luckily he was able to slide into home on his own safely.
LEADFEMALE:It seems that what you said to that man last night was exactly what he needed to hear.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, you actually saved his life.
LEADMALE:I did? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Now I have just one thing to say to you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADMALE:You do it again, and I'm gonna kick your cassock from here to kingdom come! You know, what I don't understand is why you did it in the first place.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I don't seem to be able to do anything right, and I I saw the way you respected Father Denny.
LEADMALE:And I thought if I became a priest, you'd respect me too.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:I respect you more than any person I know.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I can't seem to get a job.
SUPFEMALE:I don't even make it through job interviews.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:But what you have is the integrity to be yourself.
OTHERMALE:I mean, even when it means you're out of step with the entire planet.
LEADFEMALE:And I think that's really special.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:At least I've realized now that I I don't want to be a priest.
OTHERFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you finally understand.
OTHERMALE:I want to become a nun.
LEADFEMALE:MORK: Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:( in Gregorian chant ): Mork calling Orson Come in, Orson Mork calling Orson Come in, he who is fatter Than all before him ORSON: What now, my Mork? Ah, Orson, it's been a wonderful week.
OTHERFEMALE:I've learned to have faith in myself.
OTHERMALE:That's all any person needs, Mork.
LEADMALE:No, sir.
LEADMALE:Not on Earth, it isn't.
LEADMALE:You see, on Earth, they have the bigger, the jumbo size.
LEADMALE:It's called faith in God.
SUPMALE:Do all Earthlings believe in God? Most of them do, sir, especially when things get real hairy.
SUPMALE:But how can they believe in something that science cannot prove? Oh, that's the amazing part, sir.
SUPMALE:Because you see, that's where something called "faith" comes in.
SUPFEMALE:You see, many people believe in God even though they don't see him, and they're called religious.
LEADFEMALE:Then there are a few people who believe and they do see him.
OTHERMALE:What are they called? Prophets or meshugenahs.
SUPFEMALE:Strange, these Earthlings.
OTHERFEMALE:They need to believe in something they cannot see.
LEADFEMALE:I know, sir.
LEADFEMALE:But they don't have to see it.
LEADMALE:They feel it in their souls.
SUPMALE:What's a soul? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:No one knows what it is or Or where it is.
OTHERMALE:Let me get this straight: On Earth, faith is the belief in something you can't see, which you feel in a place you can't feel.
SUPFEMALE:You got it, big boy.
OTHERFEMALE:I need a drink.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:It's not that hard.
LEADMALE:All one has to do to prove one's faith is to look up in the sky.
LEADMALE:For example, where do stars come from? They were created long ago by natural forces.
LEADMALE:How do you know? Were you there? Of course not.
LEADMALE:It's a scientific theory.
LEADMALE:You just have to accept it.
OTHERFEMALE:On faith.
LEADMALE:Well, uh Uh, kind of.
LEADFEMALE:Uh What do you believe, Mork? Well, sir, I believe that the universe is one great big ball.
LEADMALE:And what created that ball? I don't know, sir.
SUPFEMALE:All I know is that if God didn't, at least he lets us play with it and hopes that we don't fumble.
SUPFEMALE:So until next week, this is Mork signing off.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu, nanu.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu! ( upbeat theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) ( banging on door ) Mork, where have you been? I went to the supermarket like you told me.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but that was over an hour ago.
LEADMALE:All you were supposed to get was a carton of milk.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but boy, are you in for a surprise.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have time for surprises right now.
LEADMALE:Oh, you mean, you don't have time for the new candy? Three Mile Mints, the nuclear chocolate? They melt down, but not in your mouth.
OTHERFEMALE:Here we go, a little eyewash.
SUPFEMALE:Eyewash? Yeah, that's the easy part.
LEADFEMALE:The hard part's hanging them out to dry.
LEADMALE:Some disposable diapers.
LEADMALE:Mork, I don't have a baby.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's why they're disposable.
LEADFEMALE:Here I have a little birdseed so now we can grow a canary.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, here we have Bi-Gel: The new anti-acid that goes both ways.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, a squash.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see.
OTHERMALE:Oh, faulty advertising.
SUPMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Nader will hear about that.
LEADMALE:Now, for the gourmet with no teeth: Liquid Steak.
LEADFEMALE:A good meal is just a suck away.
SUPMALE:Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Here we have a virgin wool sweater.
LEADMALE:Ha! How do they know it's a virgin? Mm-hm.
LEADFEMALE:And now, I bought something called Sugarcoated Jimmys.
SUPMALE:Just add milk, and the economy inflates.
LEADFEMALE:And we have this brand-new insecticide.
SUPMALE:It says here, "Guaranteed to kill bugs.
SUPMALE:" Oops.
OTHERMALE:There's one now.
LEADMALE:A-ha! Mork.
LEADFEMALE:All I wanted was a carton of milk.
LEADFEMALE:I've gotta whip these potatoes.
SUPFEMALE:Whipped potatoes.
SUPFEMALE:All we need is rack of lamb, we'll have a real kinky meal.
LEADMALE:You wanted milk? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:I have brought you the history of milk.
LEADFEMALE:We have your white plain milk.
LEADMALE:We have your chocolate milk.
LEADMALE:Yeah, my main lactose, what's happenin'? Here's milk.
SUPFEMALE:We have the old milk.
SUPFEMALE:We have some sour milk.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, Icky-ick.
SUPMALE:And then the history in the ghost of milk past.
LEADFEMALE:You bought every kind there is.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Well, I thought to fit in society, you have to be a consumer, so I jumped in with both feet.
LEADFEMALE:You'll have to learn to keep your feet out of your wallet.
LEADMALE:How? Even when I was leaving the store, they were still saying, "Bye.
SUPFEMALE:" Mork, you're gonna have to develop better judgment.
SUPMALE:I mean, the average Earthling doesn't become a buy-aholic.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, I've never been exposed to advertising before.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you picked up our TV signals up on Ork.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we do, but we're not stupid.
SUPMALE:We divert the commercials to other planets.
LEADMALE:That's why all UFOs come here.
LEADMALE:They're coming here to shop.
LEADFEMALE:See? You're fairly new at it.
LEADMALE:You don't know how to handle it.
LEADMALE:You better learn how to handle it before you spend us out of house and home.
LEADFEMALE:But I thought advertising was good for you.
LEADMALE:Without it, how can you know what you cannot live without? Mork, I think you ought to lay off advertising for a while.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, not just the TV, but the radio, newspapers and these magazines.
OTHERMALE:I swear, I only buy them for the naked ladies.
LEADMALE:Yeah? Then how come there's crumbs all over these ads? She was well-bred.
LEADMALE:No, I'm serious.
LEADMALE:I'm worried about you.
OTHERMALE:You're starting to lose control of yourself.
LEADMALE:Me, lose control? Ar-ar-ar-ar! You know ( knocking on door ) Oh, it's my other groceries.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, here's a little something for you, and don't squeeze it all in one place.
OTHERFEMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:No more ads for you.
LEADMALE:Well, that's all right.
LEADFEMALE:I still have Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Video.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, and no more TV, either.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Uh Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, heavy sigh.
LEADMALE:Here I am in a media society, forced to sit on my ads.
LEADMALE:( doorbell dings ) Oh, that must be Remo.
LEADMALE:Will you get that for me? Hope it's a traveling salesman.
LEADMALE:Hey, Morko! Hey, Remo! Hey, Morko! Hey, Remo-o! Hey, Morko! Hey, Remo! Hey! Don't do that.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry about my sister Jeanie, but, uh, she couldn't pass up the chance to see her first operation.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think she'll drop by later? No.
SUPMALE:Could you eat after somebody handed you an adenoid? Ha! Get it? An adenoid.
LEADMALE:Ar-ar-ar.
LEADFEMALE:Speaking of eating, I brought you something for dinner.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADMALE:It's just what we need.
SUPFEMALE:A nice bottle of ketchup.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, and it goes well with either meat or fish.
OTHERMALE:MINDY: Here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Red Nun.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:It's full-bodied and a good week.
OTHERMALE:I'll put it on ice.
SUPMALE:Well, we can eat as soon as my frozen peas and pearl onions are done.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I love those exotic vegetables.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you make yourself at home? You really do? Yeah.
SUPMALE:That's wonderful, because 50 years ago, Clarence Birds Eye had a dream and froze it.
LEADMALE:He was the first man to make a million dollars from frigidity.
LEADFEMALE:What's he talking about? Um, Mork's really into commercials.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's only because I want the best for those I care about.
OTHERMALE:Here's to good friends.
OTHERFEMALE:Watch it, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You're beginning to think in 30-second blurbs.
SUPFEMALE:Please, Mindy, Let me watch just a little bit of TV, please.
LEADMALE:Just a touch of video in the night.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Please, please, with sugar substitute on top.
LEADFEMALE:Please, Mindy, please.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
SUPMALE:No, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Um, he has no sales resistance.
SUPFEMALE:That's the trouble with the world today.
SUPFEMALE:People don't know what they want.
LEADFEMALE:But not this fella.
SUPMALE:Not Remo DaVinci.
LEADMALE:I never buy anything I don't need.
OTHERFEMALE:You ought to learn that.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah? What about that strange aftershave you wear? What's so strange about English Vinyl? Nothing, if you don't mind smelling like a chair.
SUPMALE:It's a man's scent, Mindy.
SUPMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe there's a reason men wanna smell like a chair.
LEADMALE:The reason is the overstuffed girl in the commercial.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:I like her too.
LEADFEMALE:( giggles ) What's the matter with him? Mork, are you all right? Oh, sure, I'm all right.
LEADMALE:Heh-heh.
LEADMALE:She thinks I'm hooked on ads and commercials.
SUPMALE:Me, hooked on TV.
LEADFEMALE:Ar-ar.
OTHERMALE:Chortle, chortle.
LEADMALE:I mean, I can go weeks without seeing them.
SUPFEMALE:Days, eons, epics, light years.
OTHERFEMALE:Why do I have to start now? Please! Please! Please! Please, let me just watch a little bit of TV, please.
LEADFEMALE:Just a touch of video.
LEADMALE:I miss the little mountain lion going: ( Growls ) And the little dough boy going: ( High-pitched giggles ) And the Ty-D-Bol man going, "Dive! Dive!" Please, Mindy! I'm going, "Chow, chow, chow! ( high-pitched voice ): Chow, chow, chow! Chow, chow, chow!" Argh! Plop plop, fizz fizz, Oh, what a relief it is Please, Mindy! Can't you see it?

OTHERFEMALE:Please come Ar.
OTHERMALE:You! What are you doing here? It's after midnight.
SUPMALE:Well, good, old, lovable Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley, I was passing by, and I smelled your television on.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I'd come in and watch a little bit with you, maybe just a few minutes.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you watch upstairs? Well, your ceiling's in the way.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, why don't you watch your own set? Mindy won't let me because I'm It's no real problem, but now, I'm going through cold video.
LEADFEMALE:Can I just stay for a while? Not now.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, man.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, come on, man.
SUPMALE:Don't you? ( knocking on door ) Who is it? MORK: Bourbon Delight.
SUPMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:I thought I threw you out.

SUPMALE:All right, come in, but be quiet.
LEADMALE:Thank you.

LEADFEMALE:The original and scarier version.
LEADMALE:What's it about? About alien beings who come down to Earth.
OTHERMALE:Oh, a documentary.
OTHERMALE:Look! My lord, they've got him! What are they gonna do with him? They come here to take over our minds and bodies and control us.
OTHERMALE:Why? Shh! That's not a shh, shh.
LEADMALE:That's a drunken snake.
LEADMALE:ANNOUNCER: We'll return Oh, now look what you did.
SUPMALE:You kept blabbing all through the movie.

LEADFEMALE:Look, hers is definitely whiter.
SUPMALE:Take the shirt! Take the shirt! You're a bozo.
SUPMALE:Oh, let me change the channel and find another commercial.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa, son of a gun, if she suddenly isn't shapelier.
LEADFEMALE:Look at that.

SUPFEMALE:Here, have one.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:The ingredients in each gooball are pure and provide much-needed energy and even may build a bone or two.

SUPFEMALE:You know, I use 100 of these every night instead of taking a shower.

LEADFEMALE:( electronic humming ) What's your problem? Flaking, itching, peeling? No.
SUPFEMALE:Split ends.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you sell girdles.
SUPMALE:Mork, it's me, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Run while you've got the chance.
SUPMALE:Your life is in danger here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, it's not.
OTHERFEMALE:These people are wonderful.
OTHERFEMALE:They look like they're on severe medication, but No.
LEADMALE:It's not what it seems.
SUPFEMALE:Quick, come over here.
OTHERFEMALE:Shh.
SUPMALE:I'm not one of them.
LEADMALE:See? This is fake.
SUPMALE:Whoa.

SUPMALE:I was being chased by people with TV antennas in their head.
LEADFEMALE:And they were after me and they were after you.
SUPMALE:They were all controlled by a man named Mr.

LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I don't want to.
SUPMALE:I want my free will.
LEADMALE:You know nothing is free unless you buy the giant size first.
SUPMALE:Perhaps you'll reconsider after a little friendly persuasion.
LEADFEMALE:Wouldn't you like to be looked up to by everyone you meet? I was once on the planet of the dwarfs.
OTHERFEMALE:A person of discriminating tastes like you deserves the very best, wouldn't you agree? Well Yeah, I think so.

LEADFEMALE:( snaps fingers ) What? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:You'll never go to the prom with breath like zoo dirt.
LEADFEMALE:And that hair, it's so dull and lifeless.

SUPFEMALE:Come on Ow! Well, I couldn't sleep through that noise.

LEADMALE:People were trying to make me buy things.
SUPFEMALE:Buy! Buy! Buy! Buy! Buy! Buy! Mork, nobody can make you buy things.
SUPMALE:Yeah, Mr.
LEADMALE:Persuasion can.
LEADMALE:Eeh! So ads can because they're so big and strong and they make such nifty promises, and they're so nice to you.
LEADFEMALE:Not if you're a thinking buyer.
LEADFEMALE:Just be selective and use your own judgment.
LEADFEMALE:But I want everyone to like me.
LEADMALE:I want to be part of the peppy generation.
LEADMALE:People don't like you for what you own.
SUPFEMALE:They like you for what you are.
LEADMALE:What are I? Weird but semi-likable.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I'll tell you what, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:The next time the urge to buy comes over you, just ask yourself, "Is it really necessary? Do I really need it?" All right, let me rehearse.
SUPMALE:Need! Do I really need it, Elizabeth? No, too strong.
LEADMALE:( mumbling ): Do I really need it? All right, I think I've got it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm ready now.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Let's try it out right now.
OTHERMALE:Let's see if I can find a commercial.
LEADMALE:Oh, there's one.
SUPMALE:MAN: Crunchy potato chips, Okay.
SUPMALE:Delicately salted and mouth-watering good.
LEADFEMALE:The crispy taste treat everyone loves.
SUPFEMALE:How can you say halt to Mr.

SUPFEMALE:Now, what do you ask yourself? Do I really need it? And what is your answer? Damn straight! ( Laughs ) Mork.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Do I really need it? The answer is y-y-y N-n-no! Good.
OTHERFEMALE:Eh.
LEADFEMALE:Ar-ar-ar! You're off to a good start.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, where are you going? You might not need it, but I sure do.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you like potato chips 'cause you're in for a little surprise.
LEADFEMALE:Look what I got for us.
SUPMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:I know what you're going to say, but I really needed these.
LEADMALE:For what? Well, I I filled your bathtub with clam dip.
LEADMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( mysterious theme playing ) Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, great white hoax.
LEADMALE:ORSON: What did you learn this week, Mork? This week, Your Immenseness, I learned about advertising.
LEADMALE:I must warn you, Mork, Orkans are vulnerable to Earth's powers of persuasion.
LEADMALE:I know that, sir, especially since we Orkans don't have bathrooms, but you see, advertising is nothing to be afraid of.
LEADMALE:Without it, there'd only be Julia Child going: ( As Julia Child ): Today we'll have chicken lips au gratin.
LEADMALE:( normal voice ): Besides, advertising tells us about new and wonderful things to replace our old and wonderful things.
LEADFEMALE:Without it, Farrah would just be another Fawcett.
SUPFEMALE:But don't you have an insatiable craving to buy everything? Well, sir, I must admit I did at first, but then I learned a valuable lesson.
LEADFEMALE:See, I learned that the greatest energy crisis on Earth is a shortage of willpower.
OTHERFEMALE:For example, if there's something on television you don't want to watch, you simply just press this but 
LEADMALE:
OTHERMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu! ( upbeat theme playing ) ( liquids boiling ) ( knocking on door ) Come in and hold your nose.
LEADFEMALE:Why should I hold my What is that? A stewed narconium.
LEADMALE:I'm fixing Mindy an authentic Orkan dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Narconium? That sounds like some sort of chemical.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it is.
LEADMALE:You see, you Earthlings load up your food with chemicals, we Orkans have totally eliminated the food.
SUPFEMALE:Well, uh, why would you eat something that smells like that? It's full of tudium, the gravity vitamin.
LEADMALE:Without it, we'd fall right off this planet.
OTHERMALE:Uh, well, can you let it simmer for a while so we can talk? All right.
LEADMALE:I'll have to come back every 10 minutes and stir or else the molecules will stick together and it'll clot.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Well, what's on your cerebellum? Uh, you and Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:I've been away for a while and I was wondering if you and she were still getting along real well.
LEADMALE:Oh, we're as happy as a couple of bivalve mollusks.
LEADMALE:Hmm? Oh, "clams" to you.
LEADMALE:Y-you see, I never really understood your relationship.
LEADFEMALE:After all, you're such different people.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, I'm the one that's different.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, Mindy's always been the same.
OTHERMALE:Uh, uh, I mean you come from such different backgrounds.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I see.
SUPFEMALE:"Can a spunky humanoid from Earth find happiness "with a boy from the wrong side of the galaxy? Let's see.
OTHERFEMALE:Follow me.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:" ( chuckling ): Well, yeah, something like that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how are you and your new mate? Oh, fine, fine.
LEADMALE:Well, uh, it's always tough at first.
SUPMALE:I mean, even you and Mindy had problems.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I scoff at that assertion.
LEADFEMALE:Name one.
OTHERFEMALE:How about the time you took her to visit your friend Exidor's lovely mountain retreat? ( daydreaming fantasy theme playing ) I thought you were supposed to be such a trailblazer.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I made it from Ork to Earth, but there were no trees.
LEADMALE:I wonder when we lost the trail.
LEADMALE:I suspect it was right before we fell off the cliff.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I owe you an apology.
SUPMALE:Next time you could land on me.
LEADMALE:How's your ankle? Oww! It's still sprained, but at least now the toes are finally facing forward.
LEADMALE:Well, tomorrow morning I'll go looking for our luggage.
LEADMALE:I hope it didn't sink.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you sure you heard a splash? I don't know if it was that or the avalanche.
LEADMALE:I hope that beaver isn't hurt.
LEADMALE:Well, what was a beaver doing out strolling in the middle of the night anyway? Why wasn't he in his darn dam guarding his sticks and his twigs? Do you know how yucky it is to step on a beaver's tail? I didn't know those little suckers could scream.
SUPFEMALE:( screeching ) Well, he won't be sending any more little beaver messages with that tail for a while.
LEADFEMALE:You're not gonna have a nice weekend if you keep up those thoughts.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, I stepped on a beaver, I fell off a cliff and you landed on me, I sprained my ankle, and my luggage is shooting the rapids on the way to Lake Mead, and your scenic, little 3-mile hike was up the face of a cliff.
SUPFEMALE:I knew we were in big trouble when that mountain goat tumbled by.
LEADMALE:Boy, I didn't know they could scream, either.
LEADFEMALE:I'm cold and I can't walk anymore, and I'm freezing to death.
LEADMALE:But you're right.
LEADFEMALE:You are right.
LEADFEMALE:Why should I be negative? What else could possibly happen? Well, I could have lost the key.
LEADMALE:Ar, ar, ar, ar! Just open the door.
LEADMALE:You lost the key? No, he never gave me one.
LEADFEMALE:What? Mork, we'll freeze to death if we stay out here.
LEADFEMALE:Kick the door in.
LEADFEMALE:But it's Kick the door in.
LEADFEMALE:But on Ork Kick the door in.
OTHERMALE:But Kick! ( kicks lightly ) Mork.
LEADFEMALE:It wasn't locked.
SUPMALE:Oh, dopey, me.
LEADFEMALE:( daydreaming fantasy theme playing ) Well, okay.
SUPFEMALE:I admit that's one.
SUPMALE:Be honest, now.
LEADMALE:You two haven't had any other problems? Well, one eensy-beensy one.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Bickley told me that fighting was a great way to keep a relationship exciting.
LEADMALE:So to keep Mindy happy, I had this real vicious fight with her.
OTHERFEMALE:( daydreaming fantasy theme playing ) ( whistling ) Aah! Mork! You scared me to death! Well, I'm glad you're home.
LEADFEMALE:Dinner's almost ready.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you sit down and I'll set it up? There's a little extra spaghetti sauce on the table if you want some more.
OTHERFEMALE:And I'll just get the garlic rolls, and we'll be all set.
LEADMALE:You expect me to eat this slop? What is going on? You talk about more of the same.
LEADFEMALE:DÃ©jÃ  slop! Mork! What are you doing? I'm putting your buns in orbit, that's what I'm doing! What is wrong with you?! Mindy, I'm tired of eating food that even the airlines would turn down! I've seen cockroaches go, "No way!" I thought you liked my cooking.
LEADFEMALE:You had a thought? Ar, ar, ar, ar! I didn't think there was anything under that Barbie doll hairdo of yours.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa, look.
SUPFEMALE:Echo! Echo! Echo! Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you just shave it off and get yourself a mohawk? ( gasps ) That way it'll draw attention away from your nose.
LEADFEMALE:My nose, what's wrong with my nose? Are you kidding, it's Shiksa City.
LEADFEMALE:And your feet.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa! Where do you get your shoes, Barnum and Bailey? ( imitates monkey gibbering ) And what's that wonderful fragrance? Oh, no! Old Spice! Ship ahoy, ship ahoy Oh, maybe it's Indian leather.
LEADMALE:( Indian accent ): We like to make a fragrance from the cow, dead for four days, lying in the sun.
LEADFEMALE:( sobs ): Mork.
SUPMALE:( normal voice ): Mindy, don't whimper.
LEADFEMALE:It makes you look like a Pekingese with asthma.
LEADFEMALE:( panting ) And it makes your eyes look even closer together.
SUPFEMALE:( screeching ) Okay, it's your turn.
LEADMALE:( crying ): Oh, Mork! I just can't believe Boy, this is gonna be great.
LEADFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) Mindy, Mindy, Mind, Min, Min.
LEADMALE:That was the best fight I've ever seen.
LEADMALE:Was it good for you too? Come on, now, it's time to kiss and make up.
OTHERFEMALE:Kiss and make up? I wouldn't kiss you if you were the only alien on Earth! I think I am.
OTHERMALE:There's your proof! Oh.
LEADFEMALE:So you don't like my cooking, huh? We Well, if you don't like it, why don't you get off your face and cook something for yourself! You don't know this.
LEADMALE:It's not that easy to be living with a monster from outer space.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, most guys just leave the cap off the toothpaste, right? You eat it! Okay, fight's over.
SUPFEMALE:Kinzex.
SUPMALE:Fight's over, my foot.
SUPMALE:So you don't like my hairstyle, huh? Well, Mr.
SUPMALE:Taste, where'd you get these rags? Ow! A fire sale at Disney World? She didn't mean it.
LEADMALE:She didn't mean it.
LEADMALE:Oh, and by the way, since we're into honesty, I'd like to inform you that your normal voice sounds like Truman Capote on helium.
LEADFEMALE:( imitating Mork's voice ): Hello, I'm Mork from Ork.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu, nanu.
LEADMALE:But you can just call me Space Turkey.
LEADMALE:Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar, ar! Ow! Ow! See, I'm I'm cutting myself.
LEADMALE:Look, there's blood.
SUPMALE:There will be.
LEADFEMALE:Blood, blood.
LEADFEMALE:Bleed.
OTHERMALE:Bleed.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, that's such a shame.
LEADMALE:We'll have to have that taken care of.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call the veterinarian.
SUPMALE:Mindy, I think I've made a mistake.
SUPFEMALE:You made the mistake? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I made the mistake.
SUPFEMALE:I should have listened to my father.
SUPMALE:I never should have let you move in here in the first place.
SUPFEMALE:If he told me once, he told me a million times.
OTHERMALE:"Mindy, stick to your own species.
LEADMALE:" Well, Mind, I guess I'll just go up to bed Go up to bed, my foot.
LEADMALE:There is an egg leaving in 10 minutes.
SUPMALE:Be in it.
SUPMALE:Mindy? My lips aren't that long.
LEADMALE:( daydreaming fantasy theme playing ) I mean, I don't want you to think the whole year was that bad.
LEADMALE:I did try and help Mindy too.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sure you did.
LEADMALE:But you gotta admit, for a moment, you were proud of me, weren't you, Pops? Mork, believe it or not, I am proud of you.
SUPFEMALE:I know how happy you've made Mindy.
LEADMALE:( sighs ): Aw.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, thanks, Pops.
OTHERMALE:Boy, I guess I should have knocked first.
SUPFEMALE:( chuckles ) Oh, Min, Pops and I were just talking over old times.
SUPMALE:Yes, I've missed a lot in this last year.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you also gained a lot too.
LEADMALE:And speaking of that, where's your new bride? Oh, uh, uh, she She's back at the house.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why don't you call her up and invite her over for dinner? Oh, Min.
LEADFEMALE:Min, we only have enough for two, unless you brought along some Narconium Helper.
SUPFEMALE:Or we could go out? Uh, I-I-I don't think I can call her.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't worry.
LEADMALE:I remember the number.
LEADFEMALE:Things aren't working out too well with Cathy and me.
SUPFEMALE:What happened? Did you two have a fight? Oh, no, no, no.
SUPMALE:It's just that I'm afraid we're not right for each other.
OTHERMALE:( wistful theme playing ) ( sighs ) This marriage may have been a mistake.
SUPMALE:( sighs ) ( upbeat theme playing ) But, Dad, you've only been married a few months.
LEADMALE:I know, but it's just not working out.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what happened? She found out you were bald? Uh, no, I told her that before we were married.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what happened? You two seemed so happy.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I was happy, but I wasn't.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I know what that's like.
LEADMALE:I thought I was once a polar bear, but I wasn't.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I'm a butterfly.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Before we were married, we had so much in common.
OTHERMALE:Like being single.
LEADMALE:Like love of music and hating carrots.
LEADMALE:It's the real reason I came over here.
LEADFEMALE:You two are really different but your relationship works fine.
SUPMALE:Maybe I'm out of line here, Dad, but I've watched you two for the last couple of weeks, and I've never seen two happier people.
SUPMALE:Yeah, like Cinderella and Prince Charming, Romeo and Juliet, Sodom and Gomorrah.
OTHERFEMALE:( scoffs ): I really wish that were true.
LEADFEMALE:But, it's just I'm finding out all these things about her.
SUPFEMALE:Well, like what? So far, you haven't been too specific.
SUPMALE:Uh, well, um, she's, um, um, completely unpredictable.
LEADMALE:I mean, I-I never know what she's gonna say or do from one moment to the next.
OTHERMALE:Well, a person can learn to live with that, you know.
SUPFEMALE:To whom are you referring? To you.
LEADFEMALE:Remember when your emotions came out for the first time? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, they've been bottled up for billions of bleens, of course they'll act like a starving fish at a worm roast.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, and I'll never forget when you came into the music store the morning after.
LEADMALE:( daydreaming fantasy theme playing ) ( as Steve Martin ): Well, excu-u-se me! ( normal voice ): Why don't you ever sell any of this stuff?! My! What's wrong? Oh, Mindy, that wasn't me.
LEADFEMALE:That was anger.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, what happened to your other emotions? Well, I think they're sleeping it off in my mind.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's been a hard day's night, I can't tell you.
SUPMALE:I'd lock 'em all up behind there except anger's standing guard.
LEADFEMALE:( country voice ): Yeah, and I'm a big boy too.
LEADFEMALE:And don't mess with me! Aww, get off! ( normal voice ): It's okay now.
LEADMALE:See? Where have you been? Don't ask.
LEADMALE:I've done things that would embarrass Idi Amin.
LEADFEMALE:Like what? Well, we started off by going to the waterfront.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, there's no waterfront in Colorado.
SUPMALE:Who says we stayed in Colorado? Here are some shells.
OTHERFEMALE:We started off by going to this really cheap dive called the Ballpark.
LEADFEMALE:Fear didn't want to go in, but Disgust called him a sissy.
LEADMALE:And Excitement was so titillated by that, he went to the bar and ordered 10 beers, one for each finger.
SUPFEMALE:Guilt felt so bad about that, he yanked us into the alley.
SUPFEMALE:Whimsy said it must be named Mohammad.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ) Shut up! Let me finish the story! Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Suddenly, we were surrounded by a vicious motorcycle gang.
LEADMALE:There were 12 of us against 42 of them.
OTHERFEMALE:Anger still spitting leather.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, whatever happened to the positive emotions, like love? Oh, yes.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know what I said to that girl on the street corner.
SUPMALE:All I remember is that she sold her car and gave all the money to me.
LEADMALE:Well, at least you seem all right now.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but that's just for the moment.
SUPFEMALE:Who knows when they'll come out again? At anytime Yeah! Shh.
LEADMALE:See? Oh.
LEADMALE:I can't go to your birthday party, Mindy.
LEADMALE:It'll ruin the birthday for you.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, the only thing that would ruin my birthday is if you're not there.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a heck of a guy.
LEADMALE:What's that? Oh, Grandma made me this for my birthday.
SUPMALE:Isn't it nice? Yeah, I knitted it myself.
OTHERFEMALE:It took me five weeks.
LEADMALE:Five weeks? Ha! What did you use for knitting needles, crowbars? Oh, I think my emotions are waking up again.
OTHERMALE:I noticed.
LEADFEMALE:Unfortunately, they're coming out at the wrong times, aren't they? Yeah, I think they're trying to get out and teach me a lesson and show me who's boss.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha! Ah-ha! Not now! It's okay.
LEADMALE:See? ( daydreaming fantasy theme playing ) Now, Dad, has Cathy ever insulted your relatives or destroyed your place of business? No.
LEADFEMALE:You know, not only have I gotten used to Mork's craziness, I sometimes even look forward to the next disaster.
LEADMALE:Oh, thanks, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:( chuckles ) Dad, what was it about Cathy that you really liked when you first met her? Well, she was so different from anyone I'd ever met, so fresh, and so full of surprises.
LEADFEMALE:So unpredictable.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I guess so.
SUPFEMALE:That's one down.
SUPMALE:What's bothering you about her now? Well, this may sound picky, but she has some really weird friends.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, she has this girlfriend who bakes these terrible oatmeal raisin cookies, and she must bring a dozen of them to the house every week.
LEADMALE:This man is cooking narconium in my living room and you think that's strange? Try comparing oatmeal raisin cookies to Exidor.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Mind, there's no comparison.
SUPMALE:Exidor's only half-baked.
LEADMALE:How did you meet him, anyway? Well, it was when I ran away from home.
SUPFEMALE:I was I was lonely.
LEADMALE:I needed someone to talk to.
LEADFEMALE:A good, solid, down-to-earth person.
SUPMALE:( daydreaming fantasy theme playing ) This is my philosophy for friends of Venus.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to study it and memorize it so that you can go out with me and convert the nonbeliever.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll study hard and let you know when I'm ready.
LEADMALE:Oop! I'm ready.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:On your feet.
SUPMALE:Uh, let's pretend that, uh, I am a nonbeliever, and you try and convert me.
OTHERMALE:Hey, you, nonbeliever.
SUPMALE:Good start.
LEADMALE:But we need more power in your voice and more conviction.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I see.
LEADFEMALE:( as preacher ): Friend I have need of your attention.
SUPMALE:Friend, do you realize that Venusians are coming down to Earth? But they're not coming here on Veterans Day, not on April Fools' Day, but on Labor Day.
LEADFEMALE:Baby, ba-a-be.
SUPFEMALE:Can you hear me, friend? I hear ya.
LEADFEMALE:Are you ready? Now, can I get a nanu, nanu? Nanu, nanu! Thank you, friend.
LEADFEMALE:Do you realize, friend, what they're coming here to do? Because they've come down here to blow the Earth to smithereens! But it's not that bad, friend, because they're sending a ship down here to save 1000 of us.
LEADMALE:And they're making a list and they're checking it twice.
SUPFEMALE:Now, friend, now, you can either stay down here in your disco, drug-infested inferno or come up to Venus and have your very own Venusian condo-minimum with hot and cold running champagne and underwater dancing.
LEADFEMALE:You must apply now! ( yelps ) Mork! Mork! That was beautiful! Why can't you be more like him? But there's something missing.
LEADMALE:What we need is more of your experiences with the Venusians here on Earth.
SUPMALE:I didn't meet them on Earth.
OTHERMALE:I met them on Venus.
LEADFEMALE:You've been there? Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:I've been to all the planets in your solar system.
SUPFEMALE:Mars? Mercury? Pluto? Oh, don't ever go to Pluto.
SUPMALE:It's a Mickey Mouse planet.
SUPMALE:( daydreaming fantasy theme playing ) I guess I can get used to Cathy's friends, especially when I see what you've had to put up with.
SUPMALE:( laughing ): Really.
LEADMALE:To tell you the truth, Dad, the problems that you're talking about seem pretty small.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, I guess you're right.
OTHERMALE:I can understand little things getting on your nerves, but imagine what life would be like without Cathy.
SUPMALE:There was a time when Mindy and I thought we'd never see each other again.
OTHERMALE:We were captured by Necrotons, put in this big cage where we were waiting to have our brains sucked out.
LEADFEMALE:( daydreaming fantasy theme playing ) ( imitates harmonica playing "Nobody Knows the Trouble I See") Come on, Min, cheer up.
LEADMALE:Hey, I'll give you a little ride.
LEADFEMALE:She was only a girl In a gilded cage Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Stop trying to cheer me up.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I know.
OTHERFEMALE:It's kind of hard to frolic in the face of doom.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I've been thinking about all the things that have happened to me since I've met you.
LEADFEMALE:But one thing for sure, I never thought I'd end up sitting in a birdcage waiting for my brains to be sucked out by Necrotons.
LEADMALE:Well, look on the bright side.
LEADFEMALE:You still have your health.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you know, you You didn't have to come back and risk your life to save me, but you did.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but I kind of botched up.
LEADMALE:'Cause if I'd done the right thing, you'd be safe in your own home when they destroyed the Earth.
SUPFEMALE:I guess we've had a full life.
LEADFEMALE:I only wish I'd gotten to meet Anson Williams.
OTHERMALE:Mork, there's something that I've been wanting to tell you for a long time, but I just couldn't.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what is it, Mind? Well, one time when you weren't home, I I put on your spacesuit.
LEADMALE:The helmet too? Boots and all.
LEADMALE:Are you mad? No.
LEADMALE:I have a confession to make to you too.
SUPFEMALE:Well, one time when you weren't home, I I held your blow dryer and jumped up and down on your bed.
SUPFEMALE:Are you mad? No.
LEADFEMALE:I guess we've done it all.
SUPFEMALE:( daydreaming fantasy theme playing ) What Mindy and I've discovered, it's the love between people, not their differences, that count.
OTHERMALE:Well, I definitely love her.
OTHERMALE:That's not the problem.
LEADFEMALE:It's just all the little things that are bothering me now that we're living together.
LEADMALE:Well, you lived with me for quite a while, and I had a few minor idiosyncrasies.
LEADMALE:Like the time I used your entire stamp collection on my Valentine's Day cards.
LEADFEMALE:The point is, when you love somebody, you get used to things like that.
LEADMALE:Dad, listen to yourself.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you're just like the guys on Feeva Scalactra.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, the day after the wedding, they get real nervous and jittery and they won't stay with their wives.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that sounds just like me.
LEADFEMALE:Why do they feel that way? Probably 'cause the third day after the wedding is known as.
LEADFEMALE:"Kill Your Husband Day.
LEADFEMALE:" I guess that saves on anniversary gifts.
SUPMALE:Maybe you guys are right.
LEADFEMALE:I've been blowing things out of proportion.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you're making a supernova out of a meteor shower.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, didn't these kinds of things ever happen with Mom too? Yes.
SUPMALE:I guess I'm a little out of practice at marriage.
OTHERFEMALE:Just talking to you makes me feel better.
LEADFEMALE:Well, good.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I think you should go find Cathy right now.
LEADMALE:Well, I feel I should apologize to her for the things I've been thinking.
SUPFEMALE:Apologies, that's no problem.
SUPMALE:Mindy taught me all about those.
LEADFEMALE:All right, here, you be Cathy, and I'll be you.
LEADMALE:( imitates door creaking ) Cathy, darling, I I feel there's something I have to tell you.
OTHERFEMALE:Darling, I I feel like I've been such an idiot.
SUPFEMALE:I-I mean, I've been the biggest, lamest Well, chowder head there is because Uh, Mork, I think I can handle the apology myself.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just trying to make you happy, Pops.
LEADMALE:I'm trying to help.
LEADFEMALE:You did.
LEADFEMALE:And I want to thank you both.
LEADFEMALE:( kisses ): Mm.
LEADFEMALE:( stirring theme playing ) Cathy and I are just gonna be fine.
SUPMALE:Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:And in a few years, I hope we'll have the kind of memories you two have.
LEADMALE:Oh, you will.
SUPMALE:Without the Necrotons.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ): Bye, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I should give him some narconium to take home to Cathy.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, here we go.
OTHERMALE:( humming in Orkan ) ( Mindy gasps ) ( chuckles ): Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I should have made the French fried chicken lips.
LEADMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) MORK: Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:ORSON: I'm here, Mork, waiting for your report.
LEADFEMALE:Well, sir, this week I learned about solving problems.
SUPMALE:You were playing detective? Wrong, your gravity! Got you there! We're talking about affection, not detection.
LEADMALE:You see, it seems that Earthlings have the need to talk about their problems with people that they love.
LEADFEMALE:Why do they choose to burden their friends? Well, in the words of honorable Charlie Chan, ( as Charlie Chan ): "A man who, ah, bottle up problems liable to pop cork.
LEADMALE:" Mork.
LEADMALE:Sir.
SUPMALE:Is this typical human behavior, feeling free to discuss their personal hang-ups with each other? All I know, sir, is if Romeo and Juliet had talked more, their story might have had a happier ending.
SUPMALE:But then, who would've ever heard of them? Well.
SUPMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:What about that old Earth saying that talk is cheap? Well, sir, I don't know if that's true, but when it comes to helping others, talk is priceless.
LEADFEMALE:Until next week, sir, Nanus is good news.
SUPMALE:Nanu.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dad, it's so good to have you back.
OTHERMALE:How was your trip? Well, Baltimore was okay, but after two months in a hotel room, l was ready to come home.
LEADMALE:From the clippings you sent, it sounds as if your orchestra was well received.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it was great to hear all those people coming out of the concert hall whistling Stravinsky.
SUPFEMALE:So how have things been going around here? - Not so good, Dad.
SUPMALE:lt's Mork.
OTHERMALE:- lt's always Mork.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait till you see him.
LEADMALE:He's really changed.
OTHERMALE:- ln what way? - You wouldn't believe it.
SUPMALE:lt's the last thing in the world you'd expect from Mork.
LEADFEMALE:How much could he change? Unless he's grown another head.
LEADMALE:Kitten, l'm home.
LEADFEMALE:Another day Another day, another inflated dollar.
LEADMALE:Hello, hon.
LEADMALE:Big kiss.
LEADFEMALE:Fred, really good to see you.
LEADFEMALE:How are you? How's Baltimore? l hear it's quite a little town, eh? Was it hot enough for you? How about all those dead toads? Well, what's for dinner, hon? l hope it's that mock pot roast again.
LEADMALE:What she can do with a cracker.
SUPMALE:Watch out.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's see in here.
LEADMALE:Another big kiss.
OTHERMALE:He seems fine to me.
SUPMALE:Almost normal.
SUPFEMALE:But that's the problem.
OTHERMALE:He's too normal.
LEADMALE:Mayonnaise.
LEADMALE:l can't get enough of it.
LEADFEMALE:Really good to see you, Fred.
LEADMALE:He used to say ""na-no, na-no.
OTHERMALE:"" Oh, none of that immigrant talk for me, hon.
LEADMALE:- Hey.
SUPFEMALE:You got a haircut.
OTHERMALE:- l got them all cut.
SUPMALE:My broker told me that one.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what a mind, what a mind.
OTHERMALE:Well, Fred, how do you like this new suit? Yeah, l was just admiring it.
OTHERMALE:l have one just like it.
SUPFEMALE:Doesn't everyone? What kind of a host am l? Some kind of bozo.
OTHERFEMALE:Can l get you a cocktail? How about a little Campari and Tab? How about that? lt's incredible.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:No, thanks, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- lt's not Mork anymore, Fred.
OTHERFEMALE:- Wait till you hear this.
SUPMALE:lt's too ethnic.
LEADFEMALE:Call me Morrie.
LEADFEMALE:A spaceman named Morrie.
LEADFEMALE:l'm working with children now, Fred, at a daycare centre, you know, because l think they're the future of America, tomorrow's Republicans.
SUPFEMALE:Daycare centre.
LEADMALE:That sounds interesting.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's a start, Fred.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, we've got our future to think about, right, hon? Right, Morrie.
LEADFEMALE:Morrie.
LEADMALE:Oh, Minnie.
LEADFEMALE:Morrie and Minnie.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds like something you'd see on the TV, doesn't it? - Do you play canasta, Fred? - Canasta? Mindy, l wouldn't worry about this fella.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, l used to think you were strange and peculiar, but now, gosh, you're just like one of us.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but, Daddy, he never does Orkan things anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Like, he completely stopped drinking with his finger.
SUPFEMALE:That's an old-planet custom, hon.
OTHERMALE:And l've also stopped spitting with my toe.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, who wants a lot of drool in your socks? Well, l've gotta be getting home.
LEADMALE:Cathy is fixing a meat loaf for dinner tonight.
LEADMALE:My favourite.
LEADFEMALE:Here's a little tip for you, Fred: Try it with ketchup.
LEADMALE:Hey, how about tomorrow, maybe you and l will play a little golf? - Well, l'd like that.
LEADFEMALE:- And we'll talk about some politics.
SUPMALE:Do you really think that Earl Scheib does Ronald Reagan's hair? Honey, goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:And trust me, everything is gonna be all right.
LEADMALE:lt's gonna be wonderful.
OTHERMALE:l'll see you on the first tee.
OTHERFEMALE:Fore.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mindy, now l understand where you inherited your zest for life.
LEADMALE:l think l'll just relax, watch a little TV.
LEADMALE:- Can l talk to you for a minute, Mork? - Oh, not right now, hon.
LEADMALE:Merv's gonna sing ''My Way'' underwater with an Aqua-Lung with Jacques Cousteau.
LEADMALE:l'd like to see Phil Donahue do that.
LEADMALE:Well, it's kind of important.
LEADMALE:See, it's sort of been building up for the last couple of weeks.
LEADFEMALE:l don't really know how to put this into words, but you've just changed so much.
LEADMALE:- Now, hon-- - You're just like an Earthling.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, big kiss.
LEADFEMALE:- No.
LEADMALE:l'm just afraid that there's something going wrong between us.
LEADMALE:Oh, what can go wrong, hon? We've got the whole night planned out here.
LEADFEMALE:Look, we'll start off with That"s IncredibIe! And tonight Bo Derek is gonna try to count to ten.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, look.
OTHERFEMALE:On Lou Grant, he's gonna change his shirt.
SUPFEMALE:Watch out.
SUPMALE:Oh, and on Quincy, ''Quincy falls in love during an autopsy.
LEADFEMALE:'' Well, that's a dead giveaway.
SUPMALE:Big kiss.
SUPFEMALE:Mind? Mind, hon.
OTHERFEMALE:Kitten, what you doing up? What's wrong, Mind? Mind, you're crying.
OTHERFEMALE:You used to say, ''Your eyes are leaking.
LEADFEMALE:'' l did? Oh, Mork, when you first came to Earth, you were so exciting, so different and special.
LEADFEMALE:But l think that l've ruined all that.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, l'm still the same.
SUPMALE:See? No, it's my fault.
OTHERMALE:l'm the one who told you not to act strange in public and not to sit on your face or not to feed the pigeons with a fork.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that was great, Mind.
LEADMALE:You taught me a lot.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, don't you see? l taught you too much.
OTHERMALE:l've created an Earthling.
LEADMALE:Yeah, l guess that's me, Morrie Q.
LEADMALE:Public.
LEADFEMALE:Because of me, you've lost everything that made you so wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:You think so, hon? Oh, Mork, we've got a big problem.
LEADFEMALE:l've had to make a really tough decision.
LEADFEMALE:l don't think you should live here anymore.
LEADMALE:- You don't? - No.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe if you're out on your own, that special quality might come back.
LEADMALE:There's gotta be something we can do.
LEADFEMALE:l mean, there must be someone who can help us.
SUPMALE:There's no one on Earth who's even gonna believe us.
OTHERMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:There is one person.
LEADFEMALE:There is someone who can help us.
LEADMALE:Stick your finger in my ear.
OTHERFEMALE:- l beg your pardon? - No, no, Mind.
SUPMALE:l mean we're gonna talk to Orson, you and l both.
SUPMALE:But first, l've gotta plug you into my mind, so stick your finger in my ear, hold my nose.
SUPFEMALE:You mean l'm gonna go with you into your head? - lnto your mind? Can l do that? - Well, there's plenty of room.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this is very strange.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you should have seen the old way.
LEADFEMALE:Hold on.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, l think that's how it goes, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, big buddy.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:l mean, who'd ever believe this? l'm inside an actual head.
SUPFEMALE:lt just doesn't seem possible.
OTHERFEMALE:But here l am, Mindy McConnell, who's never even been to New York.
LEADFEMALE:SiIence.
LEADFEMALE:- Somebody else is in here.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, it's just Orson.
SUPFEMALE:See? Sir, l brought my friend Mindy to talk to you.
LEADMALE:An EarthIing in your mind? This is highIy unusuaI, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:l know that, sir, but it's very important.
LEADMALE:l couldn't do it by myself.
SUPMALE:l seem to be losing my Orkan-ness.
LEADMALE:Tell him, hon.
LEADMALE:Hi, sir.
LEADMALE:- Orson.
LEADFEMALE:- Orson.
LEADMALE:- Sir.
LEADMALE:Obesity.
LEADMALE:- Sir.
LEADFEMALE:- No.
LEADMALE:- No.
LEADMALE:See, the problem seems to be that Mork has been around me so much, he's He's become too much of an Earthling.
LEADMALE:Is that true, Mork? - Yes sirree, bob.
SUPFEMALE:- This is very serious.
LEADMALE:It sounds Iike you"re affIicted with observer syndrome.
SUPMALE:What's that? It can happen when an observer spends too much time on another pIanet.
OTHERMALE:He starts to become Iike the creatures there.
LEADMALE:UnIess Mork can be cured, he"II have to be ostracised.
LEADMALE:Ostracised? Does that mean, like, cast out? He wiII be returned to Ork, where he wiII be stripped of his name, his honour and his uniform.
LEADMALE:Then he wiII be sprayed purpIe and doomed to wander his homeIand forever as a faIIen Orkan.
LEADMALE:- Oh, no.
LEADMALE:- Oh, it's awful, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:No one ever talks to you when you're purple, and the police always hassle you.
SUPMALE:- What have l done? - Perhaps irreparabIe harm.
LEADMALE:- But you said there was a cure.
SUPMALE:- PossibIy.
SUPMALE:I"II have to arrange for Mork to be visited by the most exaIted eIder on Ork.
OTHERMALE:He is very oId and very wise, and he knows aII there is to know about Orkan cuIture.
SUPMALE:If anyone can possibIy retrain Mork in Orkan ways, it"s the Ancient One.
LEADMALE:lt's gotta work, sir.
LEADMALE:l don't wanna be purple.
OTHERMALE:Orson signing off.
SUPFEMALE:Well, goodbye, sir.
LEADMALE:- That's ""na-no, na-no.
OTHERFEMALE:"" - Really? I wiII teII the eIder to pack quickIy.
SUPMALE:That's right, Dad, you heard it.
LEADFEMALE:l was inside Mork's mind, and l actually talked to Orson.
LEADMALE:Well, yeah, he said that he's gonna send down an elder.
LEADMALE:Yeah, a very wise and very old man who's gonna try to teach Mork how to get back to the way he was.
SUPFEMALE:lf it doesn't work, they're gonna paint him purple and l'll never see him again.
OTHERMALE:He's at work at the daycare centre.
LEADMALE:lt might be the last time he gets to see his little friends.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, little neighbours, let's gather round the neighbourhood.
SUPMALE:Come on, here we go.
SUPMALE:Let's go sit around Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Table.
SUPFEMALE:We have another story today.
SUPFEMALE:l'm sorry about yesterday's story.
SUPMALE:That was one by Stephen King, and naptime didn't go very well, did it? Okay, today we have kind of a fable.
SUPFEMALE:That's kind of a funny story.
LEADMALE:Once, a long time ago in a faraway land-- Maybe even a planet, l don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just leave it at that.
LEADMALE:--there lived a little fuzzy creature named Crom.
LEADFEMALE:And he lived in a little hole, kind of like a condominium.
SUPMALE:And one day, a big fuzzy lump-lump came and knocked on the door and said, ''You have to leave.
LEADMALE:'' So, what did you say? - How'd you know it was me? - Because you're fuzzy.
OTHERFEMALE:You got me.
LEADMALE:l'll give it to you straight from the hip.
LEADMALE:l've got problems, real problems, and l need your help.
SUPFEMALE:- We'll help you.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah, we always do.
SUPFEMALE:Let it out, big guy.
SUPMALE:lt's eating you up.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Lola.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's - lt's Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:- l knew it, girl troubles.
SUPMALE:Girls are always trouble.
SUPFEMALE:Put a snake in her bed.
LEADMALE:Show some sensitivity.
SUPFEMALE:The man's got grief.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Well, see, Mindy wants me to leave, and l don't want to.
SUPFEMALE:Leave? Why would you have to leave? Well, it's kind of like You know when you put pudding in the icebox for a long time and it gets real hairy? Forget that one.
OTHERFEMALE:And don't tell Mommy and Daddy l told you that one either.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Well, l used to be one way, and now l'm something different.
LEADFEMALE:Kind of like when root beer goes flat, you know? Well, l wanna find out, well, how l was.
LEADFEMALE:- l don't understand.
OTHERMALE:- Me either.
LEADMALE:When do we eat? Not now, Stephanie.
SUPMALE:Uncle Morrie has the floor right now.
SUPMALE:Stuff it.
LEADMALE:We'll have to pluck a lot of the petals off your courtesy flower.
LEADMALE:Basically, l want to find out, well, what l was like before.
LEADMALE:We'd like to help you, Mork, but we don't know how you was.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, we just met you when you came to work here.
LEADMALE:l know.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you ask Mindy what you used to be like? Well, l did, and l can't see how anybody could be like that and not be coming in on three engines.
SUPMALE:You could find out what you were like from other people who knew you before.
LEADMALE:- You mean, like, ask my friends? - Of course.
LEADFEMALE:One person isn't an accurate sampling.
SUPMALE:Poll your friends for an in-depth profile.
SUPFEMALE:That's an excellent idea, Lola.
SUPMALE:l Can l ask you one question? Are you dating Walter Cronkite? Good Iuck, Ancient One.
LEADFEMALE:You are Mork"s onIy hope.
OTHERMALE:Well, how do you like the place? Did you catch the sign out front? DaVinci's.
LEADMALE:l named it for us.
SUPFEMALE:- Tell them your new slogan, Remo.
LEADFEMALE:- Sure, sis.
SUPMALE:DaVinci's Restaurant: Have your last supper here.
LEADFEMALE:- That's really artful.
LEADMALE:- Thanks.
LEADMALE:- Where do you get those ideas? - Yeah, well.
OTHERFEMALE:l have a problem.
LEADMALE:l'm taking a little opinion poll.
LEADMALE:Do you remember what l was like before? You don't wanna know that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, l always thought you were fun, kind of unpredictable, silly.
LEADMALE:- Goofy.
LEADFEMALE:- Remo.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, l meant nice goofy.
LEADMALE:Oh, l see.
LEADFEMALE:Goofy with a side of nice.
OTHERFEMALE:- A little restaurant humour.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Nelson.
OTHERFEMALE:Table for one? Well, actually, l'm supposed to meet a friend here, the Widow Comstock.
LEADFEMALE:A woman in black? She was sitting right here.
LEADFEMALE:- l think she's in the washroom.
LEADFEMALE:- That's her, poor thing.
OTHERFEMALE:She misses her late husband so very much.
LEADMALE:- She's in mourning.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:l've got a woman weeping in my new bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:Nelson, can you help a friend in need? Sure, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Come, let us sit together.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Nelson, l'd like to get back to my former self.
LEADMALE:l mean, the way l was.
LEADFEMALE:l mean, you did it.
LEADMALE:- What's the secret? - l had to.
SUPFEMALE:Losing that election showed me what kind of a shallow person l was.
OTHERFEMALE:So l joined this group that's teaching me to think positive and feel good about myself.
SUPMALE:Oh, Nelson, here l am.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, l'd like you to meet the Widow Comstock.
SUPFEMALE:- Hi, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Hi, Wid.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's cute.
LEADMALE:Nobody's ever called me Wid before.
LEADFEMALE:But then, l've only had the title for a few months.
SUPFEMALE:You see, we were assigned to each other from the group.
LEADMALE:Kind of like the buddy system.
LEADMALE:She reminds me to think positive, and l remind her not to feel grief.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, l see.
SUPFEMALE:You buoy up the girl.
LEADMALE:Nelson has given me the moral strength to go on after my husband, Randolph Yes, yes, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Nelson.
LEADMALE:lt's been a tortured four months.
LEADFEMALE:But Randolph made me promise that if he ever went before me, l would never lose that special sparkle he cherished so much.
LEADFEMALE:The skiing, the sailing, the mariachis at midnight.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter? Your face.
SUPFEMALE:There's something about it that reminds me of Randolph.
LEADMALE:Oh, is this one better? Oh, l don't mind being reminded.
LEADFEMALE:ln fact, every day, l wear black in memory of him.
LEADFEMALE:- That's why l'm wearing this.
SUPMALE:- Was that one of his? Mork, this brave woman has truly inspired me with her spontaneous vitality.
SUPMALE:You're spontaneous.
SUPMALE:That's what Mindy wants from me.
LEADFEMALE:She want-- Are you really spontaneous? Oh, l don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Nelson, let's skip dinner and dune-buggy to the border.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
SUPMALE:Let's see, we've got weird, unpredictable, goofy with a side of nice, yes.
SUPMALE:Oh, no wonder Mindy misses me.
OTHERMALE:Well, l'm gonna get ready now.
SUPFEMALE:New Mork, new Mork That's it.
OTHERMALE:l've got to tell her.
SUPMALE:New Mork, new Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork, what are you doing? - Waiting up for you, hon.
LEADMALE:- What? - Oh, nothing, titter, titter.
SUPFEMALE:l'm just being a little silly, unpredictable, wild and goofy, like my friends said l used to be.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:Here's a little goofy: Mindy, how come you only have three fingers? Mork, are you trying to--? No, no, Mindy, you haven't seen spontaneous yet.
OTHERMALE:Mind, let's take a bus all the way to Denver and have a lot of daiquiris.
LEADFEMALE:- Come on.
LEADMALE:- No, Mork.
OTHERMALE:Mork, Mork, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:Mork, this isn't you.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you see? You're being too obvious.
LEADMALE:- lt's not gonna fool the elder.
OTHERMALE:- Yeah.
OTHERMALE:And you don't have to perform for me.
SUPMALE:l'm your friend.
OTHERFEMALE:l just wanna try to help you to find your old self.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but l guess l've run out of places to look, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:l'm just sorry l couldn't be grateful for what l had.
LEADFEMALE:l'm sorry l let it get away.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, l don't want you to be purple.
LEADFEMALE:What a strange thing to say to somebody.
SUPMALE:What's that? Either Led Zeppelin's playing nearby, or he's here.
SUPFEMALE:- The elder? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:- The Ancient One is here.
LEADMALE:- Mork, what do l say? How do l act? Just be very respectful to the old coot.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:lt's all right, remain calm, remain calm, remain calm.
LEADMALE:Stop your moving.
LEADMALE:What's happening? Mind, he's older than l thought.
SUPMALE:Your Eminence.
LEADMALE:Your Eminence, he who knows all.
LEADFEMALE:He's speaking some kind of foreign language, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- l think it's Orkan.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, of course.
LEADFEMALE:- What's he saying? - l was hoping you'd know.
LEADMALE:- Does he speak English? - l'll ask him.
LEADMALE:Do you speak English? Perhaps he didn't hear you.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
SUPFEMALE:l can speak any language l choose.
LEADMALE:Mork, l don't get it.
LEADMALE:You said somebody very old was coming.
SUPFEMALE:How old are you? Seven microbIeams, or in Earth years, eighty-six.
LEADFEMALE:Eighty-six? He looks like a 1 0-year-old kid.
SUPFEMALE:On Ork, the aging process is reversed.
OTHERFEMALE:lt's kind of like Dick Clark.
SUPFEMALE:You see, we are born in a test-tube, fully grown, grey-haired and wrinkled.
OTHERFEMALE:That way, we are treated with respect from day one.
SUPMALE:And baby-shoe bronzing is really expensive.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, as we grow older, we start to look younger.
OTHERMALE:We get smaller and cuter.
SUPMALE:And that way, all the people wanna keep their old folks at home.
OTHERFEMALE:- That's nice.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
SUPMALE:ln a weird sort of way.
LEADMALE:- Let's get on with the training.
LEADMALE:- Oh, all right.
LEADFEMALE:According to the metre, you're only 1 7 percent Orkan.
LEADMALE:Mork, if you are not a full Orkan by the time l am finished here, you will be ostracised.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:The disgrace, the shame and the shande of it all.
LEADFEMALE:To be purple.
SUPMALE:To be purple in winter too.
LEADFEMALE:Purple doesn't go well with goose bumps.
LEADFEMALE:ls there anything l can do to help? You've done enough, culture sapper.
SUPMALE:- Go away.
SUPMALE:- What? Wait a minute, buster, this is my house.
LEADFEMALE:- Who do you think you are? - My name is: - l beg your pardon? - l think he said his name was: - What a rude planet.
SUPFEMALE:- You turned him into an Earthling.
LEADMALE:Now, leave us alone so l can put the Ork back in Mork.
LEADMALE:- She meant no harm, Your Eminence.
LEADFEMALE:- She robbed us of an Orkan.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, he's right.
SUPMALE:l guess l have done enough already.
LEADMALE:l'll just go back and wait in the room.
LEADMALE:Good luck.
SUPFEMALE:- Big kiss.
OTHERMALE:- Not now.
SUPMALE:- l feel really bad for her, sir.
LEADFEMALE:- Orkans do not have feelings, infidel.
SUPMALE:Now, we shall begin with something basic.
SUPFEMALE:- Hit your head against that wall.
LEADMALE:- Right.
SUPMALE:l do not know any Libyans, and l have not yet cashed the cheques.
OTHERMALE:- How did l do? - lncorrect.
LEADMALE:You did not say ""shazbot.
LEADFEMALE:"" Again.
SUPMALE:Howard, l lost.
SUPFEMALE:lt was my thyroid.
OTHERMALE:Wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Pain first, ""shazbot"" second.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:l can see why you're the elder.
LEADFEMALE:Again.
LEADFEMALE:Let's move Laverne and ShirIey to Thursday night, okay? Try it again.
LEADFEMALE:You mean there's really another Orkan up there? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dad, it's crazy.
SUPMALE:They've been unloading a whole fleet of cargo eggs and taking strange-looking stuff into the attic.
LEADMALE:You're living with two Orkans? Oh, Dad, if Mork fails his Orkan training, l'll never forgive myself.
OTHERFEMALE:He'll make it, honey.
LEADMALE:He's doing it for you.
OTHERFEMALE:You watch.
LEADFEMALE:Soon he'll be the same fella who used to lie on the lawn, shampooing caterpillars.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, l just feel so helpless.
LEADMALE:l mean, he's going through so much, and l can't even be up there with him.
OTHERMALE:- Why not? - Because that old coot won't let me.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, honey, if Mork needs you, maybe you should be up there to help him.
OTHERMALE:Well, yeah.
LEADMALE:But l feel like an intruder in my own house.
LEADFEMALE:And who knows what's even arriving in those eggs? You sound like you're a little scared.
LEADMALE:l am, but l'm scared for Mork, not for me.
LEADFEMALE:l mean, he just might fail that test.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it never hurts to bring an apple to the teacher, if you know what l mean.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:lf you want me to, l'll go up there with you.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No, thanks, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:He's my alien.
OTHERMALE:- Are you sure? - Yeah, l'm sure.
SUPMALE:Okay, well, l guess l can go, then.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Now, look, if you need me, l'll be home hiding under the bed.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:Stop.
LEADMALE:lt's a pure Orkan environment up there, and you're not going to spoil it.
LEADFEMALE:Listen: See, you and l have gotta have a little talk.
LEADFEMALE:Now, l care about Mork, and l want him to be Orkan again just as badly as you do.
LEADMALE:l mean, l think Orkans are great.
LEADMALE:They're terrific.
SUPMALE:But you just gotta let me help him.
LEADFEMALE:Do you understand? - Pardon me.
LEADFEMALE:- l can't take this excitement.
SUPFEMALE:l'm not a young man anymore.
SUPFEMALE:- All right, you may go.
LEADFEMALE:- Thank you.
LEADMALE:But you must not contaminate what we have up there with your Earthliness.
SUPFEMALE:Put this on.
LEADFEMALE:- ls this gonna fit me? - One size fits all.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, l'll be back there, putting it on.
SUPFEMALE:Up the stairs, down the stairs.
LEADMALE:This planet's rough on old people.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hello.
LEADFEMALE:You must be one of Mork's little friends from the daycare centre.
LEADMALE:What's your name? Listen, you little Leave here at once.
LEADFEMALE:This is no place for children.
SUPFEMALE:- What are you, a wise guy? - Very.
SUPFEMALE:How would you like to go for a ride in my Cuisinart? How do l look? Hi, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, l came up here to complain about the noise.
LEADFEMALE:Can't you play dress-up a little more quietly? Where'd you get your outfits? Frederick's of Mars? They're cute at that age.
LEADMALE:Let us go.
LEADMALE:But l must warn you, your upper level has been transformed into a world no Earthling has ever seen before.
LEADMALE:What's happening, my man? Looking good.
LEADFEMALE:- l don't believe this place.
LEADMALE:- Quiet.
SUPFEMALE:He's on the na-no machine.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Hi, Mind.
LEADMALE:Wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Big na-no, Mind.
SUPMALE:He's firm, but he's fair.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you look good in Orkan threads.
OTHERMALE:l didn't know they made them in cadet.
LEADFEMALE:What's happened to this place? You'd never even know we were in the attic.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, gribIitch means he's on a break, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Those elders have a tough union.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let me show you around.
SUPFEMALE:- Wow, it's really fantastic.
SUPMALE:- Shucks.
LEADFEMALE:What's that? What's that thing? That was Orkan words of wisdom.
LEADMALE:lt'll come around again.
LEADMALE:See, here it says: Which means, ''Life is like a Kusshhbaya.
LEADMALE:"" - Deep, huh? - Yeah, l'll bet.
LEADMALE:Let me show you a picture of where l grew up.
LEADFEMALE:You mean this is what Ork looks like? Well, some of it.
OTHERMALE:They tore most of it down to make swamps when they found out earthquakes were an allergic reaction to condominiums.
OTHERMALE:lt's even prettier in the fall.
LEADMALE:lt comes so quickly too.
LEADMALE:You too.
SUPFEMALE:There it goes.
OTHERFEMALE:- That is amazing.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, the artist is really fantastic.
LEADMALE:You should see one of his sunsets.
LEADFEMALE:Here comes one now.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at that.
SUPMALE:Listen, Mind.
LEADMALE:Crickets.
LEADFEMALE:Those are the three moons of Ork: Lumpy, Squeezy and Jo-Jo.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, are all these things helping you to become more Ork-like? Oh, they sure are.
LEADFEMALE:They all remind me of things back home, especially my pet noggachomp.
LEADFEMALE:Well, noggachomps are the number-one pet on Ork, even more popular than cocker frenkIes.
LEADMALE:Mine's the cutest little one of all.
SUPFEMALE:Here, let me call him.
LEADMALE:Bebo, come here, boy.
LEADMALE:Come here, Bebo.
LEADFEMALE:- l think he likes you, Mind.
LEADMALE:- Yeah, as a friend or a munchy? No, don't worry, hon.
LEADMALE:They only eat hair and rugs.
LEADFEMALE:That's why political candidates on Ork have to be real careful.
OTHERFEMALE:- Well, call him off.
SUPMALE:- Oh, okay.
SUPFEMALE:Here, Bebo.
SUPFEMALE:l don't know whether he's coming or going most times.
LEADFEMALE:He's gonna dance with me.
SUPMALE:l missed you, boy, l missed you.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, it's a boy? - l don't know.
LEADMALE:l've never had the nerve to turn him over.
LEADMALE:Yes, Your Eminence? Break's over, Mind.
LEADMALE:Take a hike, Bebo.
SUPFEMALE:- Next phase.
LEADFEMALE:- Sir.
LEADMALE:You will relearn your Orkan pledge of allegiance.
LEADMALE:Put your hand over your hearts.
LEADFEMALE:l pledge allegiance to my planet.
SUPMALE:The rest of the known universe can can it.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- What's happening? - What's happening? - What was that? Killer Naugahyde.
SUPMALE:We call it the sizzler.
LEADMALE:lt probably thought you were a Malibu chicken.
LEADFEMALE:lt was really hot.
LEADFEMALE:- lt was like it was trying to fry me.
SUPFEMALE:- That's all right.
SUPMALE:You can only sit down if you have asbestos shorts.
LEADFEMALE:- You're safe now, though, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:- Get away from him.
SUPFEMALE:But she needs me, sir.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, wait a minute, you don't under-- Mind? Mind? She checked out and took the baggage too.
SUPMALE:You froze her.
SUPFEMALE:You're more concerned about her than you are about being an Orkan.
LEADMALE:lt's no use.
SUPFEMALE:Your training can't help you.
SUPMALE:You're going back to Ork now.
LEADMALE:- No, sir, l can't leave Mind.
SUPFEMALE:- You must.
LEADFEMALE:After all these years, you'll never know that l said goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Big kiss.
LEADMALE:No, sir, l can't leave Mind.
LEADFEMALE:We'll build you another one, a more advanced model with a power seat.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, sir.
LEADFEMALE:See, there will never be another Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:You underestimate technology.
LEADMALE:We must go.
OTHERFEMALE:No, sir, you don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy's-- Blasphemy.
LEADMALE:An elder understands everything.
LEADFEMALE:You young people have no respect.
LEADFEMALE:l meant no disrespect, Your Fogyness.
SUPMALE:lf l can only show you what a Mindy is, l'll kiss your tiny feet through your sensible boots.
SUPMALE:All right, but be quick about it.
LEADFEMALE:See what's different is that she has qualities that we Orkans don't have.
LEADMALE:Sometimes she's happy.
LEADFEMALE:- Sometimes she's sad.
SUPMALE:- Mork.
OTHERMALE:Sometimes she's fun-loving.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you kid.
LEADMALE:Sometimes she's inquisitive.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, how did you get your tongue through the keyhole? But most of the time, she's caring.
SUPMALE:She's caring.
LEADFEMALE:She's really caring.
LEADMALE:- ls something stuck? - Yes, sir.
LEADMALE:Me on Mindy.
LEADMALE:Strange concept, yet it has such a hold on you.
SUPMALE:Well, sir, you see, that's why l've got to be an Orkan, sir, so l can stay here with her.
LEADMALE:l mean, she means more to me than anything in the known universe.
LEADFEMALE:l mean, is there anything we can do? There must be something.
LEADMALE:Well, there is.
OTHERFEMALE:No, it's far too dangerous.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sir, l'll risk anything.
LEADFEMALE:l'd even shave with a live weasel.
SUPFEMALE:l haven't done it in many bIeams.
SUPMALE:lt's horrendous.
LEADMALE:lt's terrifying, a last resort.
LEADMALE:l'm too old even to consider it.
LEADMALE:But maybe with her help - What happened? - With her help, l can possibly do it.
SUPFEMALE:Do what? There's a remote possibility that l might be able to pull the Earth spirits from your body with the Ritual of the Sacred Eggs.
SUPMALE:The Ritual of the Sacred Eggs, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, gasp, choke.
LEADMALE:Extreme fear.
LEADMALE:Everything pulses through my body.
SUPMALE:Mind, he's an ''eggsorcist.
LEADMALE:'' With this ceremonial egg, l will attempt to remove the Earth spirits from his body.
LEADFEMALE:- l only hope l'm strong enough.
LEADFEMALE:- Why? What's gonna happen? lt's not going to be pleasant.
LEADMALE:Wouldn't you feel more powerful if you were upstairs, in your own environment? No, we must fight the Earth vibrations off where they're most powerful.
SUPMALE:That's why it's so dangerous.
SUPFEMALE:Earth behaviour, begone.
SUPMALE:- Oh, Mork, are you all right? - Mork's not here right now.
LEADMALE:Morrie's the name, Earth creature's the game.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you mean, my credit's no good, Lord? Your grandma writes bad cheques at Macy's.
LEADMALE:The Earth spirits won't let go of him.
LEADFEMALE:l must try harder.
LEADMALE:- Begone.
LEADFEMALE:- Get that thing away from me.
SUPMALE:The next time you get that near me, there'd better be pantyhose in there.

LEADMALE:The Earthly spirits seem to have left.
LEADFEMALE:Let me help you up.
LEADMALE:Are you all right? Oh, Mind, l had this horrible dream.
LEADMALE:l dreamed my head spun all the way around and l spit out Linda Blair.
LEADFEMALE:Let me help you.
LEADMALE:Let me get this off.
LEADFEMALE:Look, your hair's growing.
LEADMALE:l'm back to my roots.
OTHERFEMALE:l'm back to my-- Thank you, Your Geezerness.
LEADFEMALE:He's just the way he used to be, right? The Ork-o-metre will tell us that.
LEADMALE:There's no place like home.
LEADMALE:Only 93 percent Orkan.
LEADMALE:You failed.
OTHERFEMALE:Prepare to leave for Ork to be ostracised.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, it can't be.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mind, we cannot question the wisdom of an elder.
LEADMALE:- Can we? - No.
LEADMALE:See? Mind, something's knocked theout of: Mind, he said the ritual would be dangerous, and yet he still did it for me.
LEADFEMALE:- And you did it for me.
SUPMALE:- Oh, and you did that for him.
LEADFEMALE:You know, life would be a lot simpler if we were selfish.
LEADMALE:Let's see if we can get him to drink some juice.
LEADMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Let me, sir.
LEADFEMALE:There we go.
LEADMALE:- Oh, yeah, l forgot.
SUPFEMALE:- lt's all right.
LEADFEMALE:He's not drinking.
LEADMALE:Maybe l should fix him some soup.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, the noodles would get caught in his fingernails.
LEADMALE:Oh, good, he's drinking.
SUPMALE:- What's he saying? - lt's Orkan for: He'd like a frozen daiquiri, and what's your sign? l was about to take Mork away, and you wanted him to stay.
LEADMALE:Why did you help me? l had to.
OTHERFEMALE:You needed someone.
LEADMALE:As a wise elder, l have never uttered these words before: l don't get it.
LEADMALE:Well, it's lt's called caring, Your Eminence.
OTHERFEMALE:Strong medicine.
OTHERMALE:l think l'm beginning to realise what a Mindy is.
LEADFEMALE:Well, at least you understand that, sir.
LEADMALE:l'm ready to leave now.
SUPMALE:- You're not a perfect Orkan.
LEADMALE:- Spare me.
OTHERFEMALE:And the rules say l must take you back.
LEADFEMALE:- Rules are rules, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:- True.
SUPFEMALE:But you are not playing the same game down here.
OTHERFEMALE:- You both taught me that.
SUPMALE:- l don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:Puzzlement, a sense of disorientation, sir.
LEADMALE:Perhaps if you were any more Orkan, you'd be of no use as an observer.
LEADMALE:- You'd stick out.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:Like me.
LEADMALE:You belong here.
OTHERFEMALE:- You mean he can stay? - Yes, oh, soft-lapped one.
LEADMALE:Thank you, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Jubilation, ''shiksalation.
SUPMALE:'' Oh, fern.
LEADMALE:Fern, l'm back.
LEADFEMALE:You too.

SUPMALE:l'm back, jack.
LEADMALE:Take it easy, chair.
OTHERMALE:Sorry, sir.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Your Eminence.
LEADMALE:l liked that.
OTHERFEMALE:- That was called a hug.
SUPMALE:- lnteresting concept.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we have them on Ork? Either we're too advanced, or we don't want the Baptists to know that we're dancing.
SUPMALE:l must go now in order to catch the next time warp.
OTHERMALE:But if l should ever happen to be in the galaxy again, would you mind a visit from an old man? - Any time.
LEADFEMALE:- We promise we'll write.
LEADMALE:Yeah, as soon as we learn how to spell: Well, na-no, na-no, or as you Earthlings say: Goodbye.
SUPMALE:Well, it's nice to have you back, Mork.

OTHERMALE:Music to my ears.
LEADMALE:His Eminence toId me what happened.
SUPFEMALE:It must have been quite an experience for you.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, sir.

OTHERFEMALE:- Good, Mork.
SUPMALE:Where did you find it? - ln the Forest of Us, sir.
SUPFEMALE:And where is the Forest of Us? Well, down the path of change, where the squirrels of self hide the nuts of inner peace.
SUPFEMALE:In other words, Mork, what you"re saying is Iife is Iike a Kusshhbaya? Yes, sir, yes.
SUPMALE:Come on home, Mama, take anything you need.
LEADMALE:Basically, sir, l'd like to thank you, Mind, littleand everyone who made me an Orkan again, sir, because that's the way l really wanna be.
SUPMALE:- I"m gIad to hear that, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Oh, me too, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Because l learned a very important lesson.
SUPMALE:You can make your home anywhere in the universe, but it's most comfortable if you furnish it with your own traditions.
LEADMALE:And l feel best in Early Mork.
LEADMALE:Until next week, sir, na-no, na-no.
LEADFEMALE:You think the mail's here? l'm expecting something.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, if it's important, say no more.

OTHERFEMALE:How far you going? - Denver.
LEADFEMALE:- Denver? No, thanks, Glenda Faye.
SUPMALE:l think that maybe some other time.

LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, l was sorry to hear about your loss.
LEADMALE:There will never be another Randolph.

LEADMALE:But l'm working on them.
SUPFEMALE:Well, my friend Mindy's like that too.
LEADMALE:She's been real sad recently.
SUPMALE:l don't know why people are unhappy when there's so many clowns in government.
SUPMALE:They're unhappy because they grew up.
LEADMALE:But l thought you have to grow up so you can feel guilty and be an adult.
SUPMALE:You may have to grow tall, but you don't have to grow up.
LEADFEMALE:- Can you keep a secret? - Sure.
LEADFEMALE:You know that--? Does he have one wheel in the sand? Well, what's your secret? l'm Peter Pan.

LEADMALE:The little guy's still inside.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and it sounds like he's got gas.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, you've made my day.
OTHERMALE:Oh, who am l kidding? You made my life.
SUPMALE:Somebody believes in me.
OTHERMALE:Where l come from, everybody believes in you.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, where's that? - Well, it's l come from a place far, far away, where the plants are as intelligent as the people and the sky is yellow and brown.
LEADMALE:Pittsburgh? No.
SUPFEMALE:What would you say if l told you l come from a planet called Ork? l'd say, ''Welcome.
LEADFEMALE:'' At last.
SUPMALE:You know, where we come from, we say, ''Na-no, na-no.
LEADFEMALE:'' Oh, what does that mean? Well, it's a lot nicer than the old greeting.
SUPMALE:- Which was? - ''Yo, lizard thighs.
LEADFEMALE:'' l love laughter.
LEADMALE:You know, l tried to get everyone to laugh here at least once a day.
SUPFEMALE:Sid's two years behind.
LEADFEMALE:My friend Mindy's the same way.

LEADFEMALE:See, that's why l came and got you so we could both make her happy.
OTHERFEMALE:lt's been a long time since l've been out there.

LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:Okay, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Peter, aren't you forgetting something? Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:What's the matter, Pete? l'm sorry, Mork.
OTHERMALE:l can't go home with you.
SUPMALE:Why not? The house is pretty clean and l make a great hot fudge tortilla.
SUPMALE:You don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:l can't leave.
OTHERFEMALE:lt's against the rules.
LEADMALE:Okay, everybody, it's time.
OTHERMALE:Pete, l mean, you gotta come.
LEADMALE:l'm-- But-- - Leave it to me, leave it to me.
OTHERMALE:- Peter? Ma'am, you don't understand, you see, Peter has to come home with me and see Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, l'm sorry, but this is where he belongs.
OTHERFEMALE:Gee, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:l'd like to help Mindy, but l can't.
SUPFEMALE:Will you come visit me soon? Sure.
SUPMALE:Ma'am, how come he can't get out? You have to understand, Mork, they must be locked in at night for safety.
OTHERMALE:Oh, so they don't bump their wings.
OTHERMALE:Yes, this too is true.
SUPMALE:Hello? Oh, hi, Julie.
LEADMALE:What? You got a scholarship? Well, how sweet and thoughtful of you to call and tell me.

SUPMALE:lt's not looking good, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:How was your day? Did you have fun with Peter? Oh, not bad.
LEADFEMALE:- l have a question l'd like to ask you.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yeah? Why do they lock some people up? - Why do you ask? - l don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Why you paranoid? l'm not paranoid, are you? Well, l'm just a little curious about Earth customs, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:Well, they usually lock people up because they commit crimes.
LEADFEMALE:What if they didn't commit a crime? Then they should be set free.
LEADMALE:Wheels are turning.
SUPMALE:A little justice must be done.
LEADMALE:- Pardon me.
LEADFEMALE:- No.
LEADMALE:You see, Mork, sometimes life on Earth isn't always fair.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you mean like earthquakes demolish cities, floods wipe out homes.
SUPFEMALE:The Rebozo twins get the scholarship.
SUPFEMALE:l think l'll go lie down and count the sparkles in my ceiling.
SUPMALE:Oh, poor Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Adult life can really be tough sometimes.
OTHERFEMALE:lf only Peter Pan were here.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:This is a job for Morky Bell.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, Mork, maybe l shouldn't.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's against the rules.

LEADMALE:No, come on, see? We're gonna break out, see? Don't chicken on me, see? Over the wall, see? We're gonna get out of this pig house.
LEADFEMALE:Now come on.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, Mork, Mork, no.
LEADFEMALE:Happy Valley isn't a prison.
LEADMALE:lt's, you know, a funny farm.
LEADMALE:Oh, you mean a place where they grow jokes.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
OTHERMALE:lt's where they put people who are different.
LEADFEMALE:And people out there really think l'm different.
LEADFEMALE:l don't know.
LEADMALE:Maybe leaving isn't such a good idea.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, come on.
LEADMALE:Mindy needs you.
SUPMALE:The world needs you.
LEADMALE:Even Disneyland needs you.
LEADFEMALE:But what if she turns out to be like all the others? l put myself in here years ago because people didn't believe in me.
SUPMALE:Why should she be any different? Oh, she'll believe in you.
OTHERMALE:l mean, she believed that l came from outer space in an egg.
LEADFEMALE:- She bought that? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:Come on, come on, Mindy needs you.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:You're going out there? You won't get more than 50 feet before some fink will rat on you.
OTHERFEMALE:Who would do a thing like that? Me.
LEADMALE:You see, you can't trust anybody.
LEADMALE:l trust you, Sid.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Pete, you make it hard on a fink.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it's time l started trusting people out there.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you mean you're gonna do it? Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, l love you, you big pixie.
SUPMALE:Mork, Mork, what about the grill? Step back.
OTHERFEMALE:Big deal.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.

SUPMALE:A little for me.
OTHERMALE:Now think lovely thoughts and fly! l think that fairy sold you some bum dust, Pete.
SUPMALE:Mork, what is it? Oh, Mind, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry about your troubles.
LEADFEMALE:They've been tackled.

SUPFEMALE:l got you something even better than the scholarship.
LEADFEMALE:Peter, come on down.
LEADMALE:Peter? Your pen pal spent the night? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:He's here right now.

SUPMALE:- Right here in River City? - No.
LEADMALE:Mork, Peter has got to go back to Happy Valley.
LEADMALE:l thought you said people don't have to be locked up.
SUPFEMALE:No, you misunderstood.
OTHERFEMALE:Peter Pan isn't real.
OTHERFEMALE:lt's just a fairy tale.
LEADMALE:l knew she wouldn't believe.
OTHERMALE:Oh, give her a chance, Pete.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mind, you believe in me.
SUPMALE:Why don't you believe in him? Because you really are Mork from Ork and he's right here in my apartment.

LEADMALE:You've been miserable.

SUPMALE:- Oh, Mindy, why don't you enjoy what you have instead of worrying about what you haven't? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Do it for me.
LEADMALE:Well, do it for the little person inside of you.

OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, thanks.
LEADMALE:Oh, shucks.
SUPMALE:l really do feel much better.
LEADFEMALE:l really do.
LEADMALE:Even though you didn't get the scholarship? Well, you know, l've been thinking.
LEADMALE:l don't need a degree to prove that l'm good enough.
LEADMALE:l'll go out and get a job without it.
SUPMALE:So what if it's a little scary? Well Oh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:l forgot to say thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, l better get back.
LEADMALE:They're looking for me around the corner.

LEADMALE:Peter Panitis? What's that? Sir, it's the only disease that's better than the cure.
LEADMALE:You know, l found out this week that some people on Earth take life too seriously.
LEADFEMALE:l mean, they worry too much.
LEADMALE:- That's easy for you to say, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yes, sir.
SUPFEMALE:You get to observe Earth and have fun while l'm on Ork doing all the work.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Your Kvetchiness.
SUPMALE:l mean, you can have fun anywhere.
SUPMALE:There's a little child inside of all of us that needs to be let out.
LEADFEMALE:See? Hi, hi, how are you? Come on, let him out.
SUPMALE:All you have to do is a little of this.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, try this: Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Being silly doesn't change anything, Mork.
LEADMALE:Oh, sir, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Give it a try.
SUPMALE:Just a crow, a little crow.
LEADFEMALE:Croquette.
SUPFEMALE:Enough of this nonsense.
OTHERFEMALE:- l have work to do.
LEADMALE:- Aye, aye, sir.
SUPFEMALE:That's the ancient version of ''arr, arr,'' sir.
LEADMALE:Or ''aye, aye,'' sir.
LEADMALE:That's the Christmas version of ''arr, arr.
OTHERFEMALE:'' But until next week, sir.
SUPMALE:Come on, Beeb.
SUPFEMALE:That's all right.
SUPMALE:We failed.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry about it.
OTHERMALE:Crowing, how ridiculous.
SUPMALE:l got you, sir.
LEADFEMALE:l knew you'd try it.
OTHERMALE:l was just coughing, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Well, sir, one piece of advice.
LEADMALE:Don't take anything for that cough.
SUPMALE:Until next week, sir.
LEADMALE:l knew there was a little person inside of all that fat, Bebo.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for driving me to work, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, hello, Mork, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, hi.
SUPFEMALE:l'm glad you're here early, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:l have bad news.
SUPMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:Paul Simpson, the man we lease this daycare centre from, also owns the roller disco place across the street.
OTHERFEMALE:Our lease is up the end of the month, and Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Simpson isn't going to renew it.
LEADFEMALE:He's going to tear down the daycare centre and make it a parking lot for the skating rink.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, he can't do that.
LEADMALE:What'll happen to our little munchkins? They can't play hopscotch in the fast lane.
OTHERFEMALE:God only knows.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Simpson called, he's going to come over here this morning and explain things.
OTHERFEMALE:lf he appears, l'll be back in a second.
SUPFEMALE:But Oh, Mork.
OTHERMALE:We better put our heads together.
LEADMALE:Those kids are gonna be thrown out in the streets.
LEADMALE:Yeah, l'll give that Mr.
LEADMALE:Simpson a piece of my mind, or at least a hunk of my frontal lobe there, Mind.
LEADMALE:l mean, eviction of little munchkins, well, that's rude.
SUPMALE:l mean, we can't be mean to kids.
SUPFEMALE:Well, this isn't a Joan Crawford daycare centre.
LEADFEMALE:You know, if it's the Paul Simpson, he's really a powerful man.
OTHERMALE:l mean, he owns half of Boulder.
LEADMALE:Well, we'll just have to tell Mr.
SUPFEMALE:The Paul Simpson that he's dealing with Mork the Defender.
LEADMALE:Oh, he's making my jaws tight, Mind.
LEADMALE:lf l ever see him, l'm gonna give him what for.
OTHERFEMALE:- What five, give him what six.
SUPMALE:- Excuse me.
LEADMALE:- What six and a half.
LEADMALE:- l'm Paul Simpson.
LEADMALE:Oh, what for? Oh, please, don't throw the little yodas out, Master Simpson.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, don't you understand? l mean, you can't tear down the orphanage.
LEADMALE:Little Orphan Annie and Oliver Twist will be thrown out in the cold picked up by Fagin and forced to lie, cheat and steal.
LEADMALE:Then they'll take them to Hollywood and work in B movies.
LEADMALE:They'll never have an agent.
OTHERFEMALE:- They'll never know-- - Mork.
OTHERMALE:Lighten up.
SUPMALE:And it's not an orphanage, it's a daycare centre.
LEADMALE:Who ever heard of Little Daycare Centre Annie? You stay there.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Simpson.
SUPMALE:But if you tear down the daycare centre, what'll the kids do when their parents go to work? Oh, l don't wanna see this place torn down, but l'm not doing it, my son is.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you mean, you don't own the roller disco? Well, technically, l do, but l bought the place and gave it to my son.
LEADMALE:Can't you tell him not to tear this place down? Oh, l have to let him do it his way.
LEADFEMALE:He's always been irresponsible, a troublemaker.
LEADFEMALE:The only thing he can do well is skate.
SUPFEMALE:l bought that rink and gave it to him, hoping it would straighten him out.
SUPFEMALE:lt seems to be working, so l'm not going to interfere.
LEADFEMALE:l can understand your concern for your son, but what about all those little kids? Well, l'm going to wait here for Mrs.
LEADMALE:Fowler.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you go down and talk to my son, Wheels? Wheels? ls that a family name? His real name is Carroll.
LEADMALE:For some reason, he prefers to be called Wheels.
LEADMALE:Wow, that guy's really good.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe.
LEADFEMALE:l haven't been skating in such a long time.
LEADMALE:l hope l don't fall down and hurt myself.
LEADMALE:Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, what's the big deal here? We're not flying to the moon.
LEADFEMALE:Just talking a little skating, a little gravity, a little friction.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's not that easy, Mork.
OTHERMALE:Have you ever done it? Mindy, how hard can it be? l mean, you got four wheels on each foot.
OTHERFEMALE:Ever seen an eight-wheeler tip over, a Peterbilt gono, boy.
LEADFEMALE:Come on home, Mama, l'll take anything you need.
SUPFEMALE:See? Ta-da, no big deal.
LEADMALE:Oh, no big deal.
LEADFEMALE:You're walking on the carpet.
SUPMALE:Mindy, l mean, we Orkans are born balancers.
SUPMALE:l mean, we can waltz on water, we can tap dance on tapioca.
OTHERFEMALE:See this? Watch out there.
LEADMALE:We can also polka on the head of a pin.
SUPMALE:You know, we-- Hey, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Mind? Mind, please help me get up.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mork, you shouldn't balance on your nose.
SUPMALE:l just don't understand how those eight-wheelers stay upright.
SUPFEMALE:Good, here comes Wheels.
LEADMALE:Why don't we catch him while he's alone? That's all right, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:l'm okay, l'm all right.
LEADFEMALE:You go on, l just have a little cramp in my shoelace.
OTHERMALE:- l'll be okay, l'm a superior being.
LEADFEMALE:- Okay.
LEADMALE:Bye, Mind.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind.
SUPMALE:Mind, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:My name is Mindy McConnell, and l have a friend who'd like to talk to you.
OTHERMALE:Oh, where is your friend? He can talk to me while l'm scraping up the gunk.
LEADMALE:He's right here.
SUPMALE:He's here somewhere.
LEADMALE:Where could he be? Would you get to the point? Wheels is busy.
OTHERMALE:Here you go, sign there.
LEADMALE:All right, but l'm not gonna sign it Carroll.
SUPMALE:l'm signing it Wheels.
LEADFEMALE:Well, see, l shouldn't be the one that talks to you about this, because Mork is the one who has the bone to pick.
LEADMALE:Mork, come up here.
SUPMALE:Oh, you must be Wheels.
LEADMALE:And you must be Toes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you kid.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, actually, l'm Mork from the daycare centre.
SUPMALE:You go to daycare centre? Shoot, l was in jail at your age.
LEADMALE:He works there.
LEADMALE:l suppose you know the reasons why you shouldn't tear it down.
LEADFEMALE:- Nope.
SUPMALE:- Nope.
SUPFEMALE:There's some kind of an echo here, Mindy.
LEADMALE:But what about the children? Oh, well, we'll try to get most of them out before we flatten the place.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute here.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of a human being are you? What kind of a? You big turkey, he doesn't even know how to skate.
SUPFEMALE:Now, look, chicky poo, if you don't like the way l do business, you can get your perky little pigtails out of here.
LEADMALE:Mind, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:You sure l can't change your mind about that daycare centre? You got about as much chance of that as you do of outskating me.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, l'm gonna fall.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, l accept your bet.
SUPMALE:- What bet? - Buddy.
LEADFEMALE:Let go of me.
LEADMALE:Will you let go of me? Now, what bet? Well, you said that if l beat you in skating, you'd change your mind.
SUPFEMALE:Well, l accept your challenge, yup.
SUPMALE:l didn't say that.
SUPMALE:Oh, are we discoing to a different beat now, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Thing? Yeah? You hear that, everybody? Wheels the Professional says that he doesn't wanna race Mork the Beginner, huh? Mind, he's quaking in his skates right now, isn't he? Hey, Wheels, they're laughing at you.
LEADMALE:Don't be silly, l'm not afraid of him.
LEADMALE:Okay, l'll race him.
SUPFEMALE:You hear that, everybody? He accepts my challenge, Mind.
LEADMALE:Mork, you can't beat him.
LEADFEMALE:Mind.
OTHERMALE:Now, l am a superior alien being, remember that.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, then let's get this straight.
LEADFEMALE:lf Mork wins, then the daycare centre stays.
OTHERMALE:And if you win, it becomes a parking lot.
SUPMALE:Hey, what difference is it gonna make anyway, huh? How many laps around the rink, clown? Clown? No home rink advantage for you, no way.
LEADFEMALE:Here comes the superior part, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Watch this.
OTHERFEMALE:This is the only rink in Boulder.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you supposed to skate? We're gonna skate the Rockies.
SUPMALE:The Rocky Mountains? - That's the superior part? - Yeah.
OTHERMALE:We're gonna start up Eagle Point, skate down through Boulder Mountain Park, end up at the mall.
LEADFEMALE:That's ten miles and steep.
OTHERFEMALE:And there might be snow.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, a little: Are we writing a little cheque with our mouth that our feet can't cash maybe? You don't know.
LEADMALE:Are you in, big guy, or not? l guess l'm in.
SUPFEMALE:- All right, yeah.
OTHERMALE:- lt's my pride.
SUPMALE:Saturday, high noon.
LEADMALE:Be there or be square.
LEADMALE:Mindy, we've got the oldest trick in the book.
SUPMALE:- lt's in the solar system guidebook.
LEADMALE:- Yeah? Watch this one.
LEADFEMALE:You're a rink skater.
SUPMALE:But up there on the mountain where there's no strobe light, no disco beat and no spandex, we're equal.
LEADFEMALE:Well, l gotta admire a guy that can put one over on me.
LEADFEMALE:Wheels, why don't you let the smart guy read your belt buckle? Sure, l enjoy a little light reading.
SUPFEMALE:''Colorado State Rink Street Cross-Country Skate Champion.
OTHERFEMALE:'' Pretty.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Mindy, Mork simply doesn't have a chance to win the race.
SUPMALE:Oh, l agree.
SUPMALE:He got up before dawn to start training.
LEADMALE:That was six hours ago.
LEADMALE:He seems to have a will, but there's no way.
LEADMALE:l think l hear Rocky now.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, what's wrong? Oh, Mind, you see this finger? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:That's the only part of my body that doesn't hurt.
OTHERMALE:And that's because l think it's a clean break.
LEADMALE:Let me help you.
OTHERMALE:Look out.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mork, just - Okay.
LEADFEMALE:- Hello, Fred.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you look terrible.
OTHERMALE:l was all right, Fred, until l skinned my eyes.
LEADMALE:Mind.
LEADMALE:You'll never guess who l ran into, Mindy.
OTHERMALE:Who? Well, you beat me, but no fair.
SUPMALE:You took a shortcut through the rose hedge.
SUPMALE:Oh, Dad, this is Glenda Faye Comstock.
SUPMALE:We went to high school together.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, yes.
OTHERMALE:l've always liked you, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes.
OTHERFEMALE:- Where'd you run into Glenda Faye? - Well-- He ran into me here, then here, and a little later right down here.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, do you mind if l use your bathroom? l'd like to powder my bruises.
SUPMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, l really admire your spirit.
LEADFEMALE:Six hours of training.
LEADFEMALE:Where'd you go? Well, Mind, you wouldn't believe this, but l went all the way around the block.
OTHERFEMALE:How many times? Times? Mork, you can't learn to skate like a professional in a week.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Fred, l've got to.
SUPFEMALE:l mean, l've gotta do it for the kids.
SUPMALE:And besides, l can't lose, no way.
OTHERMALE:Why can't you lose? Well, because this is the land of the home, free of the brave.
SUPFEMALE:Because the good guys always win, and that's me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, who says the good guys always win? Oh, Fred, movies, television.
SUPMALE:l mean, look at that.
LEADMALE:l mean, it's the American way.
LEADMALE:When's the last time you saw Genghis Khan ride off into the sunset? All right, you little Mongols, head your little ponies up.
SUPMALE:Or when's the last time you saw Peter Lorre ride off into the sunset? Happy trails to you Until we meet again You're very pretty.
LEADMALE:You see, it's determination.
OTHERMALE:Determination, it's the little skater who thought he could.
LEADMALE:l think l can, l think l can.
LEADFEMALE:Can, yes, l can, can, yes, l can.
SUPFEMALE:See? Determination, Fred, and that's what l've got lots of.

LEADFEMALE:And l see by the old watch on the wrist that the race is about to start.
LEADMALE:Yes, our two daredevils should be getting ready to start the race right about now up at the top of Eagle's Peak.
SUPFEMALE:- Now, you know your route.
SUPFEMALE:- Okay.
LEADFEMALE:You go down Oak Street, you turn onto Pearl, and then you go right into Boulder Mall.
OTHERMALE:Right into Boulder Mall.
SUPMALE:Too bad they don't make those in loafers, huh, Mind? Look at that helmet.
LEADFEMALE:He looks like Amelia Earhart.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, he's nothing.
SUPFEMALE:- Watch out for the potholes.
LEADMALE:- Potholes, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:- And the ice, it's slippery.
LEADMALE:- Yeah, yeah, that's right.

LEADMALE:Orson calling Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Mork.
SUPMALE:Not now, Orson, l'm busy.
OTHERMALE:l gotta get an unlisted head.
LEADMALE:l wonder who left those tyres in the middle of-- Oh, no, someone could Where'd you come from? Oh, a little spot called death's door.
OTHERFEMALE:l'd like to talk about the start of that race.
SUPMALE:Where l come from, it's usually ready, set, bang, skate, not ready, set, skate, bang.
SUPMALE:l know it's a very subtle difference, but Speaking of where'd you come from, how did you get beside those tyres? What tyres? What tyres? l Rapidly mounting suspicions here.

LEADFEMALE:Not when the bad guys cheat.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but l don't wanna cheat.
LEADFEMALE:l don't wanna do anything rash.
LEADMALE:lf you won't be rash, how you gonna catch him? Well, it's a drastic measure, but l could always induce translinear phasial-molecular motion.
SUPFEMALE:Could you translate that into Earthling, please? Well, basically it's a time warp, Mind.
LEADMALE:But l can't do it for very long.
SUPMALE:l don't know if l have time to catch him anyway.
LEADMALE:At this point, you gotta try anything.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, look who's telling me to cheat.
OTHERMALE:l'm not telling you to cheat.
SUPMALE:He's the one that's cheating.
SUPMALE:And anyway, you're doing it for the kids.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, the little munchkins.
LEADMALE:You're right, Mind.
SUPMALE:l'll see you at the finish line if l don't burn up on reentry.
SUPMALE:- Big kiss.

LEADMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, l just got word from one of our spotters that Wheels Simpson is in town and headed toward the finish line.
SUPFEMALE:Mork is nowhere in sight.
LEADMALE:Well, it looks like Wheels is an easy winner, ladies and gentlemen.
SUPFEMALE:Wheels is coming down this-- Wait a minute, ladies and gentlemen.
SUPFEMALE:Our spotter says that Mork is in town and skating towards the mall.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you slowing down? Use your time warp.
LEADFEMALE:l'm all warped out, Mind.
LEADMALE:l don't get it.
LEADFEMALE:The bad guys are winning, and the good guys are here sucking air.
LEADMALE:You can do it.
LEADMALE:What about all that talk about determination and drive? Oh, you're right, l can't let a little thing like physical exhaustion stop me.

SUPFEMALE:Swell, this is really exciting, Mind.
OTHERMALE:- l think l beat the best, didn't l? - Yeah, you did.

SUPMALE:Do Earthlings always race on skates? Oh, no, sir, there are different kinds of races.
OTHERMALE:There's dog races, horse races, auto races.
LEADFEMALE:lt sounds like racing is very popular there, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, sir, it is.
LEADMALE:And the most wonderful race of all could be the human race.

OTHERMALE:All they need is some kind of international referee.

SUPMALE:Oh, that's okay.
LEADFEMALE:We'll keep it real sweet and simple.
LEADMALE:Besides, l can only spend 1 0,000.
OTHERMALE:Dollars? Ten thousand dollars? The kind that you get at a bank? And not a penny more.
SUPMALE:l promised myself.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, why don't we start by making a list? Mindy, would you please get the pen and pencil out of my purse? Sure.
OTHERMALE:- Gotcha.
SUPFEMALE:- Glenda.
LEADFEMALE:Glenda, you are just so funny.

LEADFEMALE:He's a regular riot.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, he's a regular riot all right.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, can l borrow that? l'd kind of like to show it to Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure, he'll probably love it.
LEADFEMALE:Then l'm taking the other one for Remo.
LEADMALE:l am starving.
LEADMALE:Let's go to the restaurant and l'll talk him into making us breakfast.
SUPFEMALE:- Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:- Listen, you guys go.
SUPFEMALE:Mork's making me a special breakfast this morning.

OTHERMALE:Jeanie, after breakfast, how about if we go back to my building and we can catch the tail end of the limbo lesson? Gosh, am l hungry.
LEADFEMALE:lf you are, Mind, then get ready for Tarzan of the Crepes.
LEADMALE:Today, today, we're gonna bake something very special.
LEADMALE:We're gonna make huevos cosmos.
OTHERMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:First of all, let's start off by putting a few pinto beans as a base.
SUPFEMALE:Pinto, from the Spanish word meaning small car.
LEADFEMALE:Now, make sure to add a little sherry.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what a lovely shade of bleu.
SUPFEMALE:Now, we add our main ingredients, and what you do is first of all, bring out your chicken.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, look, this chicken is so young it's never known love.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please, please, please.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it's a boy.
SUPFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:Now, we must dress our chicken.
LEADFEMALE:First, you put your chicken in a lovely two-piece outfit.
SUPFEMALE:And dunk it now just like Esther Williams.
LEADMALE:And there goes you.
SUPMALE:And once again, a little more sherry, sherry and sherry alike.
LEADMALE:And a little for the cook.
LEADMALE:You never know when you'll be followed home by a wino.
SUPMALE:Now, wait for some more finish or garnish.
LEADFEMALE:For one cannot cook without a little flower.
LEADFEMALE:Once again, a little more sherry and some grated cheese.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you grate on me, grate, grate, grate.
SUPMALE:Put cheese in there, once again, who knows? Now, once again, a little more sherry.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what a lovely day.
LEADMALE:Oh, boy, one eggplant will do it.
LEADMALE:Over here, once again, a little more sherry.
SUPMALE:Little more sherry, sherry, sherry.
LEADMALE:A little salt.
SUPMALE:A little pepper.
OTHERFEMALE:And remember, you can put anything in there in the amount of time.
SUPFEMALE:Use your trash compactor, if necessary.
LEADFEMALE:Finishing up, once again, you stir it up and one little more petit cheri.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, bon appetit, my dear, bon appetit.
SUPFEMALE:Fabulous.
LEADMALE:Yes, Mind, come on, give it a try.
LEADFEMALE:Throw caution to the wind, Mind.
LEADMALE:l think that l'm on a diet.
OTHERMALE:But l got you a little surprise.
LEADMALE:lt's in my purse.
LEADMALE:- For me? - Yeah.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mind, l love surprises more than l love freeze-dried pets.
LEADFEMALE:Really, can l have it? For me? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:There's nothing in there, Mind.
LEADMALE:Mork, it's a snake.
SUPMALE:lt's supposed to jump out and scare you.
OTHERMALE:Oh, l get it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, Mork.
SUPMALE:lt's a practical joke.
OTHERMALE:lt's a prank.
LEADMALE:People play them on one another.
LEADMALE:lt's supposed to be funny.
SUPMALE:l understand that, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:l'm a superior being.
LEADMALE:You know, it's a very simple concept: snake, spring, fear.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's add that to the dish.
OTHERFEMALE:Never mind.
LEADMALE:lt was a dumb joke, anyway.
SUPMALE:Well, l wasn't gonna say that, Mind.
LEADMALE:Well, while you're doing whatever it is you're doing there, l'm gonna run to the store quick and get some decorator magazines.
OTHERFEMALE:- Have you seen my car keys? - Sure, many times.
OTHERFEMALE:You know where they might be? Well, l'll take a wild guess.
LEADMALE:Number one, in the purse.
LEADFEMALE:But don't worry, Mind, don't worry, don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:Allow moi, pardon moi.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERFEMALE:A purse.
LEADMALE:Oh, my heart, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:You take the house.
SUPMALE:Well, this is my place.
LEADMALE:Wow, neat.
LEADFEMALE:Where's the refrigerator? Oh, not now, Stephanie.
SUPMALE:l see it.
SUPMALE:The rest of you children that don't wanna eat, let's all sit down here for a moment and share a problem with Uncle Mork here.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the basic problem is that l have a heavy case of confusion.
SUPMALE:Let us be your beacon through the fog.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Lola.
OTHERMALE:Hey, what's wrong with this refrigerator? l can't see anything in here.
LEADMALE:Oh, l took the bulb out, Stephanie.
LEADFEMALE:l knew you were coming.
SUPMALE:Go suck a lemon.
SUPFEMALE:You know, there's free food down at Jack in the Box if you stand next to the clown.
SUPMALE:Well, basically, my problem is that Well, l wanna play a practical joke on Mindy and l don't really know any.
SUPFEMALE:l know one.
LEADFEMALE:l went to Jake's Joke Shop and bought a bar of trick soap.
LEADFEMALE:When my brother washed with it, his hands grew black.
SUPMALE:Oh, that sure beats busing, doesn't it? Well, it's just l'm in a desperate situation.
SUPFEMALE:ls there anything else you know? Mork, there's tons of them.
LEADFEMALE:ltching powder, sneezing powder, pepper gum - Fly in your ice cube.
OTHERMALE:- Wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, great expectations.
SUPFEMALE:l'm gonna scare the dickens out of Mindy.
OTHERMALE:Great Expectations? Dickens? You know, big fella, you're a lot deeper than you look.
SUPFEMALE:Bless you, Lola.
LEADFEMALE:Have you cleaned the refrigerator out yet, Stephanie? Don't spoil it, Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Atkins.
LEADMALE:Now, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, does that diet work.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:How was your day? Not bad.
LEADMALE:- Why are you looking at me like that? - l don't know.
SUPFEMALE:l guess l'm just kind of a mildly mischievous kind of guy.
LEADMALE:Why don't you put your coat in the armoire there? You never know what might be in there.
SUPMALE:Maybe a skeleton or a hokey-pokey man.
LEADFEMALE:- What? - Oh, maybe you have a bone to pick.
LEADFEMALE:- Go in the closet? - No, no, no.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:Now, that's funny.
LEADMALE:Seeing that, don't you really wanna fatten up? Let's go to the fridge.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, wait.
SUPMALE:Wait, wait, wait, Mind, Mind, l hope this doesn't alarm you, but there might be some bell peppers in there.
SUPMALE:Titter, titter, chortle, chortle.
SUPFEMALE:- An alarm, huh? A bell pepper.
LEADMALE:- Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, l'll tell you, you're a clever guy.
OTHERMALE:Listen, Mork, we need to have a little talk.
SUPMALE:Look, for a practical joke to work, you're not supposed to know what's gonna happen.
SUPMALE:The surprise is what makes it funny.
LEADMALE:You're kidding.
OTHERMALE:Frank, what other symphony conductor dresses like this? Since you're going fishing, come on in.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you need some worms for your fishing trip.
OTHERFEMALE:- Worms? - Yeah, they might be in there.
SUPFEMALE:l had a few.
LEADMALE:l don't know.
LEADFEMALE:- Worms in there? - Yeah.
OTHERMALE:- Give it a shot.
LEADFEMALE:- Here, hold onto this, huh? lndustrial-strength worms.
LEADFEMALE:This way, you can catch the big suckers.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, that was a pretty good prank.
SUPFEMALE:- lt was a prank, wasn't it? - l hope.
SUPFEMALE:Pretty good, my boy, pretty good.
SUPFEMALE:But it pales by comparison with some of the exploits of Pranky Franky here.
OTHERMALE:Pranky Franky? l'm being dressed by Pranky Franky? You've heard of the old car-in-the-living-room stunt? - Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, that's-- Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, who hasn't heard of it? l haven't.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, it's when you take a car apart and put it back together in somebody's living room.
LEADMALE:When l was in college, we did that to Professor Franklin's '51 Studebaker.
LEADMALE:- Oh, heavy.
SUPMALE:- Yes, but well worth the hernia.
SUPFEMALE:That prank made me what l am today.
LEADFEMALE:A legend.
LEADFEMALE:A legend? Tornado in the windmills of my mind.
LEADFEMALE:Hang on, Toto, hang on.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe l don't look so bad in this outfit.
LEADFEMALE:l don't know.
SUPMALE:Nobody's gonna see but the fish, and who are they gonna tell except a few water-logged gangsters? That's the spirit, Fred.
LEADMALE:Those fish don't have a chance.
LEADMALE:He really does look pretty funny in that outfit, doesn't he? A chance to become a living legend.
LEADFEMALE:l'll be up there on Mount Rushmore.
LEADFEMALE:Up there, l'll be with Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson, Roosevelt and all those other wide receivers.
SUPMALE:This is gonna make Mindy love us forever.
SUPMALE:Oh, boy, oh, boy, l can't wait till she sees this.
OTHERMALE:Mind.
OTHERMALE:Mind, wake up, it's morning.
OTHERMALE:Can't you hear the little birdies singing outside? Mork, it is 5:00 in the morning.
SUPFEMALE:How--? Mork, how did you--? Why would you? - When did you get this thing up here? - Mind, take your time, now.
SUPMALE:l know these compliments don't fall tripping off the tongue.
LEADMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:Get this Jeep out of here now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, and? And get this Jeep out of here now.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure you're all right, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Bickley? Just a second before, l was sitting in that chair.
OTHERMALE:l got up to fill my Thermos with coffee.
OTHERMALE:l owe my life to Joe DiMaggio.
SUPMALE:Oh, don't worry about that hole, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley.
SUPMALE:l'll Spackle it over.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
OTHERFEMALE:l think my insurance should cover this.
SUPMALE:l'll just have to check on a technicality, if my apartment is covered for collision.
LEADMALE:Well, apart from the obvious physical and emotional trauma, is there any latent appreciation for what l've achieved here? l see.
SUPFEMALE:Well, excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:Excu-- l'm going fishing.
SUPFEMALE:l've gotta get out of here.
SUPFEMALE:l don't know what l'm gonna tell my maid.
SUPMALE:She won't even do windows.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mind, look at the bright side.
OTHERFEMALE:lt's always good to have friends you can drop in on.
OTHERMALE:Mork, listen to me.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't hit me.
LEADMALE:Don't hit me.
OTHERMALE:What you did was not funny.
LEADMALE:We can't even go into our apartment because of that.
SUPFEMALE:And l don't even wanna think what might've happened to Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley, much less how much this is gonna cost to fix.
LEADFEMALE:lt was a stupid and dangerous prank.
LEADMALE:You should have been more careful.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, l was careful, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:l set the handbrake.
SUPMALE:- You set the handbrake? - Yeah.
SUPMALE:You set the handbrake? My Jeep falls through my floor and you say you set the handbrake? l can't take any more of this, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:l'm getting out of here.
LEADFEMALE:- Good.
OTHERFEMALE:Where are we going? - We're not going anywhere.
LEADFEMALE:You're staying and cleaning up this mess and getting that Jeep out.
OTHERMALE:l'm going to Glenda Faye's.
SUPMALE:Mind, Mind.
LEADMALE:Well, Mindy Well, this is the last box.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Glenda, l just keep thinking about it.
LEADMALE:l mean, a Jeep falling through my floor.
SUPMALE:How many years can a normal person put up with that kind of stuff? Four? l mean, when l first met Mork, l knew he was different, but-- You know, l noticed that too, but l never said anything.
SUPMALE:You see, l was brought up to laugh behind people's backs.
OTHERFEMALE:All l know is if this kind of stuff keeps up, Mork's just gonna have to find another Earth-- Roommate.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my.
LEADMALE:This is serious, isn't it? Well, listen, Mindy, you're welcome to stay here until you work things out.
LEADMALE:Besides, we'll have a ball.
OTHERMALE:This is a singles apartment.

SUPMALE:Hey, guys.
SUPFEMALE:Glad you came by.
SUPMALE:l'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
OTHERFEMALE:Mindy, these are my neighbours.

SUPMALE:Kind of a dynamite guy, you know.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi.
SUPFEMALE:- Great personality.
SUPMALE:Say, look, l'm kind of new in town.
OTHERFEMALE:How do l get to your place? Glenda, is there something l could help you with in the kitchen? No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you just sit.
LEADFEMALE:l'll get us all something to drink.
SUPFEMALE:- Just yell if you need anything else.
LEADMALE:- Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, l think l have everything l need right here.
LEADMALE:Cheese puffs? No, l just ate.

LEADFEMALE:Happy hour.
LEADMALE:Strawberry margaritas.
LEADFEMALE:Cowabunga.
LEADMALE:Say, why don't we share a margarita, huh? You go right, l'll go left, we'll have a salt-lick race around the rim.

LEADFEMALE:Brenda, Cindy, see you later, ladygators.
SUPFEMALE:Wasn't that fun? Weren't they terrific? Are you serious? Glenda, they didn't even know our names.
OTHERFEMALE:But they were close.
LEADMALE:Well, besides, what's in a name, as long as you're happy? Oh, come on, you don't really believe that.
SUPFEMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:Oh, look, you're gonna love it here.
LEADMALE:We'll be so busy, we won't even have time to think about what's bothering us.
OTHERMALE:l mean, you.
SUPFEMALE:What's bothering you.
LEADMALE:Glenda, come on, what's really going on? l really don't wanna talk about it.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure? Oh, Mindy, l'm not sure about anything since my husband died.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that's why l moved in here.
LEADMALE:l just wanna laugh, say hi, no involvements and nothing personal.
LEADMALE:Well, l can understand that.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Mindy.
SUPMALE:lt's just that every once in a while, l miss having somebody who really cares about me.
LEADFEMALE:You are so lucky to have Mork.
SUPMALE:l am? Give him another chance.
LEADFEMALE:A hole in your floor is a lot better than a hole in your ceiling.
SUPMALE:A hole in your ceiling is a lot better than a Well, either way, it's a lot better than a hole in your life.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You know, l really never realised how good l had it till l saw what was really out there.
SUPMALE:Things aren't so bad at home.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Bebo, a lot of people would consider this a very depressing situation.
LEADMALE:You don't have to be one of them.
SUPFEMALE:l wish that hole in the ceiling was the only thing l had to patch up.
LEADFEMALE:l really miss Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:Sometimes l can almost hear her voice now.
SUPMALE:Mork, can l talk to you for a minute? Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, you're here.
OTHERFEMALE:Bebo, wait.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, Bebo, no.
LEADFEMALE:l'm sorry, Mind.
SUPMALE:l'm sorry to add polyester to injury.
LEADMALE:Mork, l think there are a few things we should straighten out.
SUPFEMALE:Well, before you say another word, l've already started my self-improvement plan and l've made a list of my bad points.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, there would've been more, except the tears made the ink run.
OTHERMALE:First of all, l belch with my finger.
LEADMALE:Second, l snore with my toes, l chew my toenails, l sit on my face.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, nobody's perfect.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Mind, you are.
LEADFEMALE:l mean, you're wholesome.
LEADFEMALE:ln the dictionary, it says, ''Perfect, see Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:'' No, l'm not.
LEADMALE:For one thing, l don't have any patience.
LEADMALE:l should have known you didn't mean any harm.
LEADMALE:l mean, you were only trying to make me laugh.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, l thought it was just a joke.
LEADFEMALE:But, Mind, sometimes l'm a really trying guy.
LEADMALE:Well, that's very true.
SUPFEMALE:But you also have an awful lot of good points.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, l know that too, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:l made a list of those.
LEADFEMALE:Here it is.
SUPMALE:''Mindy McConnell is my friend.
LEADMALE:'' That's all that's on here.
LEADMALE:That's all l could think of, Mind, when l was sitting here alone.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, you know, you're crazy, weird, aggravating Oh, l can't help it, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:l'm a Libra.
LEADMALE:lmpulsive, exasperating and frustrating.
LEADMALE:But, you know, you're also very caring, and that's what makes it all worth it.
LEADMALE:You still like me? Well: Back on Ork, we have a very special custom when making up.
LEADMALE:Well, what's that? First of all, we grab each other's hands, we look very deeply into each other's eyes.
LEADMALE:- Yeah? - That's it.
LEADMALE:That's it? Really? Well, on Earth, we usually do all that, and then we kiss.
SUPMALE:You sure you want to? Well, l don't know.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in, Your Oliver Hardyness.
SUPFEMALE:l hope l didn't call you too early.
LEADMALE:- Oh, by the way, Mork, - Sir.
LEADMALE:l wanted to thank you for the box of cigars you sent me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no sweat, Chief Smoke.
SUPMALE:l mean, l hope you got a bang out of them.
LEADMALE:You see, sir, that's what's called a practical joke here on Earth.
LEADMALE:Nonsense.
LEADFEMALE:No jokes are practical.
LEADMALE:Oh, sir, come on, now.
LEADMALE:They serve a purpose.
SUPMALE:l mean, jokes can fill your life with surprises.
SUPMALE:Life isn't supposed to be surprising.
LEADFEMALE:lt's supposed to be ordered and predictable, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, but where's the fun in that, Your Old Fogeyness? lf life were predictable, no one would watch Miss America, they'd know who's hosting The Tonight Show, and no one would believe that an actor could become president.
LEADMALE:lmagine, giving a State of the Union address: ''My fellow Line.
OTHERFEMALE:'' - That's unpredictable? - No, sir, that's incredible.
LEADFEMALE:And so is that warm feeling you get when you tell a friend a joke.
LEADMALE:But the most important thing, sir, is to have a friend that you wanna tell a joke to.
LEADMALE:And if not, the joke's on you.
OTHERMALE:Until next week, sir, na-no, na-no.
SUPFEMALE:lt's perfect for television.
LEADFEMALE:l simply love it, Mindy, and so will Channel 1 9.
SUPMALE:That look just screams anchorperson.
OTHERFEMALE:l don't know, Glenda Faye.
LEADMALE:Don't you think it's kind of a little too daring? lt's kind of flashy.
LEADMALE:Now, you know as well as l do that every TV news team has one blond.
OTHERMALE:Barbara Walters, Rona Barrett, Frank Reynolds.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but l couldn't go to an interview looking like this.
LEADFEMALE:My hair feels naked.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe that's why blonds have more fun.
LEADMALE:Well, l've been brunet all my life and l've had fun.
LEADMALE:Have you ever water-skied the Amazon? No.
LEADMALE:Have you ever danced with a Sherpa guide on the slopes of the Himalayas? Gone ice sailing with an Eskimo prince? l can't say that l have.
SUPMALE:Of course not.
LEADFEMALE:Brunets aren't invited to those things.
SUPFEMALE:And they aren't invited to be anchorpersons, either.
OTHERMALE:Thanks for the ride, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Rebozo.
OTHERMALE:Say ''hi'' to Bebe too.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Attack of the Bleach People.
LEADFEMALE:What? They turned you into Sandra Dee.
OTHERFEMALE:They sucked on your scalp.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, they have.
LEADMALE:They turned you into Swedish.
LEADMALE:Mork, it's just a wig.
SUPMALE:l knew that, Mind.
LEADMALE:May l see it for just a minute? Sure.
LEADMALE:Cold immobilizes them, Mind.
LEADMALE:Glenda Faye was trying to talk me into bleaching my hair for a job interview l have at Channel 1 9.
LEADFEMALE:Trust me, it'll work.
SUPMALE:Well, l must be off to my tai chi class.
SUPMALE:That would be very effective against a mugger on tranquillizers.
SUPFEMALE:Well, sayonara.
SUPMALE:l learned that on Shogun.
OTHERFEMALE:- So how was your day at the zoo? - Oh, it was wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:- More than that, it was two-derful.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, yeah? l observed all these wonderful, weird animals.
SUPFEMALE:l saw two ants.
SUPFEMALE:l saw a black widow going, ''Baby, you ain't coming back here.
LEADFEMALE:'' l saw a praying mantis.
SUPFEMALE:They don't really pray, they just kind of chant.
LEADMALE:And then there was-- Oh, and l saw a butterfly and a bird and a dog.
SUPFEMALE:Those are the only animals you saw? Well, Mind, only the weird ones stick in my mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and l also made a friend at the zoo.
OTHERFEMALE:His name is Doc.
LEADMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Does he live around here? No, he lives at the zoo.
LEADFEMALE:He's a chimpanzee.
SUPMALE:He lives there with his mother.
SUPMALE:lt was wonderful.
SUPMALE:We had this incredible conversation about how Darwin was wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Right, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Well, l'm glad you had a good time at the zoo.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, good, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:l can't wait to go back.
LEADMALE:Do you have any 50-pound bags of peanuts around? No, l think we're all out.
LEADMALE:Pity.
LEADFEMALE:Since Carter lost, l thought we would.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Mork You're gonna be all right here, Doc, till we find who kidnapped your mom.
LEADMALE:Okay, that's all right.
SUPMALE:You're not even safe in a zoo anymore.
LEADFEMALE:That's incredible.
SUPMALE:l mean, they should put bars upon bars.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you are tired, aren't you? Well, we'll find a place for you.
SUPFEMALE:Have a little monk nap.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see, we can't put you over there.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you can't hang around-- What am l talking about? Mind would be mad if l didn't give you the best room.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, you can sleep in Mind's bed.
SUPMALE:Don't be afraid.
LEADMALE:She's got a life-sized doll of Jackson Browne.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't worry.
SUPMALE:- Hi, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, hi, Mind.
LEADMALE:Well, l took Glenda Faye's advice and got the hair dye.
LEADFEMALE:l guess the moment of truth has come.
OTHERMALE:Do l become a blond or do l chicken out? Mork, l want you to tell me the truth.
SUPMALE:lf l do this to my hair, do you think l'll lose my--? - You know, my girl-next-door quality? - l don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Ask the guy next door.
LEADFEMALE:The one with the binoculars, who drools a lot.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, what's the big deal anyway? So l become a blond.
OTHERMALE:lt'll all be worth it if l get that job interview.
LEADFEMALE:l hope.
LEADMALE:While l was at the zoo, something special happened.
LEADMALE:Can you tell me later? lf l don't do this now, l'm gonna chicken out.
SUPMALE:- Oh, it'll keep.
LEADMALE:- l'll talk to you later.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, one minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe less.
LEADMALE:- There's a monkey in my bed.
OTHERMALE:- lt's not actually a monkey.
OTHERMALE:lt's a chimp.
LEADMALE:That's a common misconception.
SUPMALE:You see, there are two groups.
LEADMALE:The simian groups and-- Would l seem forward if l asked for an explanation? No, just inquisitive.
LEADFEMALE:You see, that's my friend, Doc.
LEADFEMALE:The one l told you about, at the zoo? l sprung him.
LEADMALE:Mork, you took a chimp from the zoo last year.
LEADFEMALE:That was different.
SUPMALE:He was an exchange student.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you've gotta get him back.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, you don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:You really don't understand.
OTHERMALE:You're being so harsh and cruel.
SUPMALE:Mind, his mother was kidnapped from the zoo and l'm afraid the same men will come back and kidnap him.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Let me get this straight.
LEADMALE:You kidnapped the chimp.
LEADFEMALE:You were afraid that chimp was gonna be kidnapped by the people that kidnapped the chimp's mother? And they say Earthlings are slow.
SUPFEMALE:How do you get involved in these things? Oh, Mind, l'm just trying to be a caring, loving person, like you taught me.
SUPMALE:Mork, it's still not right to steal a chimp.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Now, may l pose a hypothetical question to you? You're out strolling and lo and behold, you come upon Bambi in the middle of a burning forest.
LEADMALE:Now, here's the question.
LEADFEMALE:What do you do? You either lead Bambi to safety across the river, or do you baste him in barbecue sauce and have Bambi in a bucket? Time's up, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, all right.
LEADFEMALE:The zoo's probably closed anyway.
SUPMALE:- You gotta take him back tomorrow.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:l bet in the dictionary it says, ''merciful, see Mindy.
LEADMALE:'' Oh, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, you won't even know he's here except for a few more hairs in the sink.
LEADFEMALE:But, hey, don't worry about that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, l'll take him back tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:l promise, l really do promise and-- Hey, just think how lucky you are.
SUPMALE:You get to sleep with him.
SUPFEMALE:What? Oh, Mind, come on, he's scared and lonely.
LEADFEMALE:lt's his first night away.
LEADFEMALE:- He's terrified.
SUPMALE:- Right, Mork.
SUPMALE:l'll tell you what.
OTHERFEMALE:You sleep with the monkey and l'll sleep right here on the couch.
LEADMALE:But l gotta dye my hair because l got that interview at 9:00 in the morning - He's got on my best nightgown.
LEADMALE:- l know, Mind.
LEADMALE:He had a hard time deciding.
SUPMALE:He tried on everything in your drawer.
LEADMALE:Mind? Mind? Mind? - Mind? - Are we there yet? Mind, Mind, l'm really sorry l startled you like this, but, l mean, Doc's hungry.
LEADMALE:He'd like some warm milk.
LEADMALE:- Oh, okay.
SUPMALE:- Good.
LEADMALE:l'll go unplug the refrigerator.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you get him some water? Oh, Mind, even asleep, you're hotter than a pistol.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Water, water.
SUPMALE:Doc had the hiccups, so l had to scare him.
SUPFEMALE:- You did that well.
SUPMALE:- Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, l might as well get up.
LEADMALE:lt's only four hours until my job interview.
LEADMALE:At least l'll be able to paint the circles out from under my eyes.
LEADFEMALE:l'm very sorry about all this, but you take such good care of me, l thought you could help take care of him.
LEADMALE:Yeah, l know, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You always mean well.
LEADFEMALE:l'd do the same for anybody whose mother was kidnapped from the zoo.
LEADFEMALE:Well, l'm gonna go to bed now, and try and keep it quiet out here, will you? Well, since l'm up, l might as well see how my hair turned out.
LEADMALE:No! No.
SUPMALE:- Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:- Cured his hiccups, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, look at my hair.
LEADFEMALE:lt's terrible.
SUPFEMALE:lt's supposed to be blond, but it's green.
OTHERMALE:Well, you're right, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:lnstead of being short and sassy, - it's kind of short and grassy.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:What a night.
SUPMALE:l didn't get any sleep, my hair is green, there's a monkey in my bed.
LEADMALE:Oh, l wish that darn chimp had never come here.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, you don't mean that, Mind.
LEADMALE:- Oh, l don't know what l mean.
SUPFEMALE:lt seems like ever since that monkey got here, everything's been going wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, green hair? Oh, Mind, Mind, come on, now.
LEADMALE:l think you look terrific.
SUPMALE:l mean, you can always be like an lrish debutante.
LEADMALE:Or you can be like a punk prom queen.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Mork, cut it out.
LEADMALE:- Or you can be Miss Algae.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, come on, now.
SUPMALE:Wait.
SUPMALE:You could be like a good-time girl for a leprechaun.
LEADFEMALE:Well, l guess l wasn't meant to be a blond.
OTHERFEMALE:l'll just have to buy some dye in the morning and change it back to my natural colour.
LEADFEMALE:What, gopher brown? No, it's closer to woodchuck, l think.
SUPMALE:Anyway, l'm gonna go and see if l can rinse any more of this stuff out.
OTHERFEMALE:- Mork, he's gone.
OTHERFEMALE:- No, Mind, don't-- - Doc? Doc? - Doc? Doc, Doc, Doc.
LEADFEMALE:Get in there, shorty, and no funny business.
SUPMALE:- Oh, Exidor, you found him.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork, thank goodness you're all right.
SUPMALE:You too, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:l just caught this burglar running from your house wearing your clothes.
LEADMALE:l had visions of you tied to a chair, wearing nothing but rope.
LEADFEMALE:Not a pretty picture.
LEADFEMALE:- He's not a burglar, though.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, really? Then how do you explain this? My hunch is they're your family peanuts and he swiped them.
LEADFEMALE:Lucky for you, l'm your neighbourhood vigilante.
SUPMALE:Boulder can sleep peacefully knowing Brutus and l are on patrol.
OTHERMALE:- Brutus? - My Doberman.
SUPFEMALE:- Hello there.
SUPMALE:- l wouldn't touch him there.
LEADFEMALE:Well, l'm sure you two have a lot to talk about.
LEADFEMALE:l'm gonna take Doc into the bedroom.
OTHERFEMALE:By the way, do you know your hair is green? Yes, l do.
LEADFEMALE:Did you lose a bet? - No.
LEADFEMALE:- l see.
LEADMALE:ln that case: Mork, you're a fool.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you see what's going on right under your nose? What? Am l growing a moustache? You'll have to grow a lot more than that if you're gonna compete with him.
LEADFEMALE:Did you see the way she looked at him? Mork, they're in this together.
OTHERMALE:They're gonna rob you blind and run off to Rio.
SUPFEMALE:Exidor, you don't understand, really.
SUPMALE:Has she ever carried you like that? Think about it.
LEADFEMALE:Brutus, heel.
SUPMALE:Heel, Brutus.
LEADFEMALE:Heel.
LEADFEMALE:Good dog.
OTHERMALE:Good dog.
LEADMALE:Give me your paw.
LEADMALE:Give me a paw.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, the front one.
SUPMALE:Exidor, l don't think you really understand.
LEADFEMALE:You see, he's not an ex-con.
SUPFEMALE:He's not gonna run off with Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:- He's a friend of mine.
SUPFEMALE:- Clever disguise.
LEADFEMALE:You can't even see the zipper.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:You see, his mother was kidnapped and l'm hiding him here till we find out where she is.
SUPMALE:Have you checked the pawn shops? Brutus, don't.
LEADMALE:Heel, heel.
SUPMALE:Good dog, good dog.
OTHERMALE:No, no, you see, he came from the zoo.
LEADMALE:And l can't go there because they might recognise me, but, wait a minute, you can go because you'd be inconspicuous.
OTHERFEMALE:That's true.
OTHERFEMALE:Just another face in the crowd.
SUPFEMALE:Know when to hold them And know when to fold them All right, Doc, how many you want? None? Pretty cocky.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:l'll take four.
LEADFEMALE:ls that some sort of signal? One, two, four.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that fills my inside straight.
LEADFEMALE:Well, l call.
SUPMALE:What do you have? Well.
LEADMALE:Four aces, king high.
SUPMALE:That does kind of beat a 6.
LEADMALE:Just because you cleaned me out, l'm not gonna show you my centrefold of Jane Goodall now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, somebody's at the door, Doc.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, go sit down over here.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
OTHERMALE:You wait there for me.
LEADFEMALE:l'm not mad about losing, especially since it makes you forget your mom.
LEADFEMALE:l'll be right back.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:- Hey, Pops.
LEADMALE:- Hi, Mork.
LEADMALE:l brought over some of Mindy's old toys like you asked.
SUPMALE:So that's Doc.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's the child that Fay Wray never talks about.
LEADMALE:You know, l've never been up real close to a chimpanzee before.
SUPMALE:Oh, don't worry.
LEADMALE:They won't hurt you.
LEADMALE:- Shake hands with him.
LEADFEMALE:- Shake hands? No, no, l don't think so.
SUPMALE:l have a rule.
LEADFEMALE:Never give a wild animal something you might want back.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, come on, come on, now.
SUPMALE:Here, watch this.
SUPMALE:Hey, shake hand.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You know, l think Mindy's right.
LEADFEMALE:- He should go back to the zoo.
LEADFEMALE:- Come on, now.
SUPMALE:You primates sit down and get to know each other.
LEADFEMALE:- No.
LEADMALE:- Come on, now.
SUPMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Relax.
LEADMALE:l'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:l'm going to get a couple of bananas.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:You're not gonna leave me with this thing? Why? You won't hurt him.
LEADMALE:l'm going to talk to you in a kind voice and move very slowly.
LEADMALE:Look, l'm smiling.
LEADMALE:lf you can understand, l like you a lot.
LEADMALE:l brake for animals.
LEADMALE:Hey, here's something you might like.
SUPMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:See this? This is a tricycle.
OTHERFEMALE:Can you ride one? Well, maybe you can't, so l'll show you.
SUPFEMALE:Car break down again, Pops? No, l'm just making a fool out of myself for my very good friend.
SUPFEMALE:Well, bye, Mork, and have Mindy call me.
LEADMALE:Bye, pal, and thanks for sparing me.
LEADMALE:Hi there.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Exidor.
SUPMALE:And goodbye.
SUPMALE:Nice guy.
SUPFEMALE:My dad used to walk backwards.
OTHERFEMALE:- Know what stopped him? - No, what? '68 Pontiac.
SUPMALE:Well, what's the news? What did you find out about--? Excuse me.
LEADMALE:lxnay, ixnay.
LEADFEMALE:lmpchay amray understanderay.
LEADMALE:Doc, come on, time for a little nap nap.
SUPMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:Wanna come up? Here we go, here we go.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you worry.
SUPFEMALE:l'll tell you that story again.
OTHERMALE:All right, what's the news about his mother? - Sit down, l can take it, l can take it.
OTHERMALE:- My first thought was white slavery.
LEADFEMALE:Then l figured, no, why sign up for that if l have to go look for a chimp? Then l ran into a keeper and he told me they'd rushed his mother to the zoo hospital.
LEADMALE:She wasn't kidnapped.
OTHERFEMALE:She was in the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:- What was she in there for? - Well, l couldn't find out, except that it's serious.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, if it's serious, you gotta get there right away.
OTHERMALE:- We've gotta take him too.
LEADFEMALE:- Hold it, Mork.
LEADMALE:There's a posse out looking for your fuzzy friend.
OTHERMALE:lt seems some fool kidnapped him.
LEADMALE:Coast is clear.
SUPMALE:You know, Mork, it's not easy sneaking a hot chimp back into a zoo.
LEADMALE:This is only the third time l've done it.
LEADMALE:The disguise worked because every time l call him Don Vito, no one bothered to question him.
SUPMALE:You know, hospitals give me the heebie-jeebies.
LEADFEMALE:That's why l quit the doctor biz.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see if anybody's home.
LEADFEMALE:l'm sorry, l can't talk right now.
LEADFEMALE:We're in the middle of some complicated surgery.
SUPMALE:Who was that masked man? An animal doctor who shaved off his fur.
LEADMALE:Exidor, l better talk to Doc alone.
OTHERFEMALE:Doc, now, you and l have to have a man-to-simian talk for just a second.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:You see, l don't know what's wrong with your mother in there, but if she doesn't get better, she's gonna go to a very special place.
LEADMALE:lt's called animal heaven.
SUPMALE:Everything's wonderful up there, where bananas grow on clouds, and you can swing from anything you want.
LEADFEMALE:And Flicka's up there and Trigger and all three Lassies.
OTHERMALE:You don't have to worry about anything, though.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, l know you're worried, but, you see, you'll always have part of her to hold on to, and that's her love for you.
LEADFEMALE:You were waiting for--? Doc.
SUPFEMALE:The whole zoo's been looking for him.
LEADMALE:Where's he been? Well, he was in Boulder overnight.
LEADFEMALE:We brought him right back.
LEADFEMALE:Well, his mom's had a tough time, but she's all right now.
LEADMALE:- Come on, Doc.
SUPMALE:- Hey, goodbye, little fella.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks very much and take care.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, l got a surprise for you.
OTHERMALE:l'm gonna take you back to your mama.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:Come on, come on.
LEADMALE:Oh, l'm gonna miss that little guy.
SUPFEMALE:l'd like you to meet Doc's new baby brother.
LEADFEMALE:Baby brother? So that's why his mom was in the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look at that.
LEADFEMALE:Look at that, he's got his brother's knuckles.
LEADMALE:And he's got Charles Bronson's chin.
OTHERMALE:Thanks for getting Doc back to us.
SUPFEMALE:Now the whole family can be together.
LEADFEMALE:No sweat.
SUPMALE:Hey, take care, little: lt's a boy.
OTHERFEMALE:lt's a boy.
LEADFEMALE:Have a cigar.
LEADFEMALE:Don't mind if l do.
LEADMALE:lt's a baby boy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, wait a sec.
LEADFEMALE:Hold on, l didn't mean to wake you up.
LEADFEMALE:l'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Don't-- No, Glenda Faye, somebody else got it.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for your help, but next time l go on a job interview, it's gonna be with my own hair.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Okay, l'll talk to you real soon.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, bye.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, shazbot, l lost.
LEADFEMALE:- What are you doing? Playing strip solitaire, and l'm losing fast.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, so anyway, finish your story.
LEADMALE:You didn't get in trouble or anything when you brought Doc back? No, l just told them l found him.
SUPMALE:The problem is l didn't tell them where.
LEADFEMALE:l guess everything turned out for the best.
SUPFEMALE:l got my hair back - and Doc's back with his family.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:lt's a good thing too, but you know something, Mind? l really miss that little guy.
SUPFEMALE:You know: You know, Mind, l've been thinking, maybe we could-- Don't do this to me, Mork.
SUPMALE:Mind, you're right.
LEADMALE:l'll never spring another animal from the zoo, l promise.
LEADFEMALE:l mean, this Orkan has learned his lesson.
LEADFEMALE:He must have answered the ad, Mind.
LEADMALE:Let me show you upstairs.
LEADMALE:This is where you're going for your room.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, oh, Victor Huge-O.
SUPMALE:That's not my name.
SUPMALE:Well, l'll cut the fat and get to the meat.
LEADFEMALE:This week, sir, my report is on the status of animals on Earth.
SUPFEMALE:l assume they're the respected elite? Oh, no, sir, that's only on Ork, according to the decree by Prime Minister Fluffy.
LEADMALE:But some animals have it very good.
LEADMALE:They're called pets, just like Beebs here.
SUPFEMALE:Right, Beebs? Yeah, yeah, you know how that is.
SUPFEMALE:They have it great.
LEADFEMALE:Room and board, their dish with a name on it, and all the newspapers they can read.
OTHERFEMALE:Do all animals on Earth live this way? Well, no, sir.
LEADMALE:Some live in places called zoos, where they're protected.
LEADMALE:Do any animals roam free in their natural environment? Yes, sir, but they're called game.
SUPFEMALE:Sir, l wonder how much fun the game would be, though, if the animals were the ones with the rifles.
LEADMALE:- Tell me, Mork.
OTHERMALE:- Sir.
SUPMALE:Do you think animals will ever reach the status they have on Ork? Well, sir, l have faith.
LEADMALE:But it'll take some time.
OTHERFEMALE:l know that there are some humans who love and understand animals, and realise that all living things have feelings, even though they don't have the words to express them.
LEADFEMALE:And on that happy note, sir, l say good night.
SUPMALE:ln the words of my friend, Doc the chimp: Which means, na-no, na-no, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:Until next week.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:I tell you, I've been working on your Jeep for over an hour and I can't find out what's wrong with it.
LEADFEMALE:My battery's dead.
LEADMALE:When I woke up this morning, my battery was dead.
LEADFEMALE:I can't understand what happened.
LEADFEMALE:Well, could leaving the car lights on all night have any effect on that? Why, yes, it could.
LEADMALE:Why would you ask? - No reason, no reason at all.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, all right, Mindy.
LEADMALE:There's a big reason, but a very good one, though.
OTHERFEMALE:There's always good reason.
SUPMALE:- Oh, you understand, Pops, don't you? - Yes, I do.
LEADMALE:Well, basically, there's this cute little old wino outside and he was sleeping in the gutter, and I left the lights on so no one would park on him.
LEADMALE:You're so courteous.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, as soon as I finish my coffee, I'll drop you off at the day care centre.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thanks, Pops.
SUPFEMALE:You know Oh, Mind, Mind, opening-night jitters, I've got the flop sweat already.
SUPFEMALE:I don't even have a costume yet.
LEADMALE:Mork had this idea about the kids dressing up as their favourite hero.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, kids today could use some heroes.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:When I was a boy, I used to like the Western heroes.
SUPMALE:Roy Rogers and Gene Autry and Tex Ritter.
LEADMALE:In those days, you could always tell who the good guys were because they all wore big white hats and played guitars.
LEADMALE:I always used to wonder why they never rode into town playing a violin.
OTHERFEMALE:That's probably because all the Indians had the bows.
LEADMALE:Imagine Custer's last concerto: I guess my favourite hero was the Lone Ranger.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, the Lone Ranger's a real good one, Mork.
LEADMALE:I think you'd like him because he always settled fights peacefully.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa, parallel universe.
LEADFEMALE:We have someone like that just on Ork.
SUPFEMALE:On Ork, you have somebody like the Lone Ranger? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he's more like the Lone Chicken.
LEADFEMALE:See, whenever there'd be trouble, he would always hide.
LEADFEMALE:His favourite motto was, ''When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping.
LEADMALE:'' - Sounds like the Gabor sisters to me.
SUPMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
SUPMALE:I can go as Squellman the Yellow.
LEADFEMALE:What a strange planet.
LEADFEMALE:Making a hero out of someone who does nothing but hide.
LEADMALE:- What does he look like? - No one ever saw his face.
LEADMALE:All we ever saw was this yellow-feathered tush hightailing it into the sunset.
LEADFEMALE:Happy tails to you Until we meet again And will leap tall buildings with a single boo.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a turkey.
OTHERMALE:No, it's Squellman the Yellow.
LEADMALE:The proud coward with the golden tail.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you see, that's a hero where I came from.
LEADMALE:By creative hiding, that's how he survived.
LEADMALE:Well, know who's up next? Who's up? You're up, Jonathan.
LEADMALE:I'll give you a hint.
LEADFEMALE:Sugar Ray Leonard.
OTHERFEMALE:One more hint and I might get it.
SUPMALE:Speaking of sugar, when do we eat? Now, Stephanie, you just had lunch, and very few people can eat a whole turkey and live.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, who's your hero, Stephanie? Sara Lee.
SUPMALE:I might have guessed.
LEADFEMALE:- Stick a brownie in your ear.
LEADFEMALE:- Stephanie, if you keep this up, one day you're gonna go on an elevator and it's gonna say, ''Capacity: You.
LEADFEMALE:'' Who's your hero, Lola? Truman Capote.
LEADFEMALE:For his accurate, yet lyrical portrayal of the human condition.
SUPMALE:Lola, one day you're gonna have a talk show all of your own.
SUPMALE:Billy, who's your hero? My dad picked my hero for me.
SUPMALE:- Well, who is it? - Him.
OTHERMALE:He wants me to be a doctor like he is.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's not a bad hero.
SUPMALE:I mean, they save lives, they play great golf and they never bother you at home.
SUPFEMALE:Big deal.
LEADFEMALE:My dad won't let me be who I really wanna be.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, who's that? - A guy with my name.
LEADFEMALE:Billy the Kid.
LEADMALE:He was a tough hombre.
LEADFEMALE:His dad never told him what to do.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Billy the Kid.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that the president's brother? The one that helped Reagan get elected? No? Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mork, he was a famous cowboy.
LEADFEMALE:People say he used to live in that old ghost town near here.
SUPFEMALE:That's it, a ghost town, the ultimate retirement village.
LEADMALE:Imagine the maid changing the sheets up thereyou know? Jonathan meant Windy Gulch, the old town outside of Boulder.
SUPFEMALE:I bet Billy had fun out there.
OTHERFEMALE:Got to camp out, never ate broccoli.
OTHERMALE:Billy, come as Billy the Kid if you want.
LEADMALE:- Really? - Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:- Thanks, Mork.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, shucks and wazoo, little Yoda.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that's it for today.
LEADMALE:Time for our field trip.
LEADMALE:We're gonna go to that chemical plant by the river and watch the dead fish race.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for the ride, Exidor.
OTHERMALE:Lucky for you the Shriners cancelled.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I'm going out of town and I'd like you to take all my phone calls.
LEADMALE:- All right.
SUPMALE:- Here.
LEADMALE:Where's the receiver? I don't know, I just don't want anybody calling me long-distance.
LEADMALE:Listen, I'm sure you two boys have a lot to chitchat about, so I'll just leave you two alone.
SUPMALE:Mind, Mind, come on now, Exidor's our friend.
LEADMALE:Exidor is your friend, Mork.
LEADMALE:You know, quite a few people think he's a little strange.
SUPMALE:I've heard those ugly rumours and they're grossly exaggerated.
LEADMALE:Do you have any chinchilla dip? I rest my case.
LEADFEMALE:Mork.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going away on a very secret trip, so secret in fact that I've blindfolded my burro.
SUPMALE:Some call it kinky, I call it security.
SUPFEMALE:Hush-toned, why is it so secret? Mork, there's a fortune buried out there.
OTHERMALE:I inherited this map from my late grandfather.
SUPMALE:He's deceased, you know.
OTHERFEMALE:There's nothing on this map, Exidor.
LEADMALE:A necessary precaution.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, I've got it all right there, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you memorized it, huh? No, I had it tattooed on the inside of my eyelid.
LEADFEMALE:Steinmetz, Pepe, Guido, load up the burro and pile on.
SUPFEMALE:I'm an equal-opportunity employer.
LEADFEMALE:All those people on one burro, that's incredible.
LEADFEMALE:Those amazing animals.
OTHERFEMALE:If you should get a post card saying, ''Wish you were blank,'' you know who it's from.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be back in about a month.
SUPMALE:Frankie, Annette, surf's up.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, you can come out now, Exidor's gone.
LEADFEMALE:Exidor was gone when he got here.
LEADMALE:Well, I hope your day's been going better than mine.
LEADMALE:Oh, me too, Mind.
SUPMALE:My idea about the heroes with the kids was a great success except for Billy.
LEADMALE:Oh, why? His father wanted him to be a doctor.
LEADMALE:Why? That's a good hero.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he didn't like it, so I found him a new one, Billy the Kid.
LEADFEMALE:That's not so good, Mork.
OTHERMALE:Billy the Kid was a murderer.
LEADFEMALE:He killed 21 people.
LEADMALE:You don't know that for sure.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you know how people gossip at funerals.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, I mean, he must have done something to become famous.
LEADFEMALE:Well, sometimes people become famous for the wrong reasons.
SUPMALE:Kids always imitate their idols, so it's better for everybody if you pick somebody good.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's right.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, was I wrong, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Why do Morks rush in where wise men fear to tread? Boy, that goose must weigh a ton.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good, it's the tow truck.
LEADMALE:I'd better get out there before my auto-club card expires.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Billy.
SUPMALE:- Hey there, little buckaroo.
LEADMALE:- Howdy, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, hey, just knock your feet together twice.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll do a little Chap Stick.
LEADMALE:Good to see you there, urban cowkid.
LEADFEMALE:Let's you and me go down to the old ghost town and have a shootout.
LEADMALE:Oh, can't go, Billy, I've gotta stay and help Mindy bury her dead battery.
LEADFEMALE:See, besides that, Billy, I think that-- I didn't realise that Billy the Kid was into retroactive family planning.
SUPMALE:Come on, he was a hero.
LEADMALE:You're just saying that because you're a fraidy cat like Squellman the Yellow.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thanks for the compliments, but I still can't go.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, it's just a game.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, game or no game, Billy, you see, it simulates violence.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, if you really wanna understand Squellman the Yellow, let's play his favourite game, cher chez moi, which is hide-and-seek.
LEADMALE:Okay, but I'm warning you, Billy the Kid's smarter.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be it, you go hide.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADFEMALE:One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 1 1 Adios, turkey.
LEADFEMALE:Ollie ollie oxen free.
LEADMALE:Come on, now.
LEADFEMALE:You'll never find me, I studied with Claude Rains.
OTHERMALE:Well, the Jeep's fixed.
LEADFEMALE:You're not even close, you're not even tepid.
LEADFEMALE:I'll give you a hint.
LEADMALE:Liberace.
OTHERMALE:What's going on? Mind, Mind, quiet.
LEADFEMALE:I'm playing hide-and-seek with Billy, and I'm really skunking him, he hasn't got a chance.
SUPFEMALE:No, you're not, I just saw him take off down the street on his bike.
LEADMALE:He said you'd know where to find him.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, Mind, oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:He's gone down to Windy Gulch.
LEADFEMALE:You mean that old ghost town near here, why? - I guess he wants to have a shootout.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Well, we better go get him.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mind, Mind, it's all right.
SUPFEMALE:It's my responsibility, I'd better go get my trusty 45.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, I thought Squellman was a pacifist.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, he is, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:That's his manual, 45 Ways to Hide.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, now.
LEADMALE:You look in the saloon and I'll check the livery stable next door.
SUPMALE:Billy.
LEADMALE:Billy.
LEADFEMALE:Billy, come out now.
LEADMALE:This is Father Mork talking to you, son.
SUPFEMALE:Billy, you shouldn't be here, you should be home watching TV with the other little kids, eating cereal and getting hypoglycaemic now.
LEADMALE:Don't move, varmint, I got the drop on you.
SUPFEMALE:Billy, now, come on-- I told you not to move.
SUPMALE:I got a balloon in here with your name on it.
LEADFEMALE:You don't wanna continue this and scare Ork chips out of Mork, do you? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Just checking.
OTHERFEMALE:No, Billy, no, please.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, please be careful, he might have a balloon with your name on it too.
LEADMALE:What? I don't know what's going on here.
SUPFEMALE:But you're coming home with us, young man, right now.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, push me around just because you're older than me.
LEADFEMALE:You're just like my dad.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, if we make him go home right now, he'll think that violence is the right way.
LEADMALE:But he's just a little kid.
SUPFEMALE:We can't leave him till he grows up.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I realise that.
LEADFEMALE:This is duelling philosophies right here.
SUPFEMALE:It's violence against nonviolence.
LEADFEMALE:It's like Ghandi vs.
LEADFEMALE:Dick the Bruiser.
LEADFEMALE:You understand? Like, ''I don't want to hurt the little kitty.
LEADMALE:'' ''Give it to me.
LEADFEMALE:I'll eat the thing on hoof.
OTHERFEMALE:'' That's what I'm trying to say to you, Mind.
OTHERMALE:All right, do it your way.
LEADFEMALE:Time for a showdown.
SUPMALE:We each get a balloon.
LEADFEMALE:If I hit you, Billy's best.
LEADMALE:If you hit me, Squellman's best.
LEADMALE:You're on.
LEADFEMALE:Except Squellman doesn't use weapons.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I don't think-- Okay, sucker.
SUPMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mind, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Mind, I hope now that you appreciate the subtlety of my philosophy.
SUPFEMALE:Look at the good side, Mind, you could always win a wet sweater contest.
LEADFEMALE:Gotcha, Mork.
SUPMALE:l win.
LEADFEMALE:Not so fast, Billy.
SUPFEMALE:Mind over splatter.
LEADMALE:Viva la Squellman.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah? It's not over yet, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, I don't think this is gonna work.
LEADMALE:- We gotta do something to help him.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Somehow we've gotta prove to him that being an outlaw is only exciting in the movies.
LEADMALE:That Butch and Sundance weren't heroes, they were only handsome.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, Mind.
LEADMALE:Bingo.
SUPFEMALE:That's an old religious saying on Ork.
LEADFEMALE:I think I have a way of ending this confrontation, Mind.
SUPMALE:I think there's a solution to the possible violence that's escalating before our eyes.
LEADFEMALE:We have to find young Billy, the young person who was just in here, who attempted to assassinate me with aqua pura.
SUPMALE:And if we find him, we must convince him why Billy the Kid never became Billy the Adult.
LEADFEMALE:And when we do that, we'll have a solution that is Rosemary, did you get all that? Good.
LEADMALE:Erase it.
LEADMALE:Okay, Mork, I'm gonna go down to the gas station to call his parents.
LEADMALE:You wait here to see if Billy shows up.
LEADFEMALE:Come on out, you lily-livered coward.
SUPFEMALE:I heard you're looking for me, kid.
OTHERFEMALE:Where are you? I just rode into town a little while ago.
OTHERFEMALE:My horse is tied up outside.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't hold that balloon if I were you.
LEADMALE:You see these notches on these suspenders here? There's 21 of them, you know what happens when I get 22? - What? - My pants fall down.
OTHERMALE:That's why I have to wear this serape here.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? What happened to Squellman? Squellman? Somewhere, someone's got a fistful of feathers.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you come on down, son? Buy you a little drink.
LEADFEMALE:Right now, I'm so thirsty I could belch dust.
LEADMALE:Barkeep, sarsaparilla for my friend, and I'll sip danger.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Neat.
LEADMALE:How'd you do that? There's some questions you can't answer, Billy, Iike how does Venus de Milo hitchhike? Mind if I tinkle, Bill? Wow, this is fun.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, ain't it? lt wasn't always that much fun, Billy.
LEADMALE:Especially when there were guns involved.
OTHERMALE:You know, sometimes there might be a real intense game going on here with people sitting in those chairs.
OTHERFEMALE:Let your imagination wander.
SUPFEMALE:See what happens.
LEADFEMALE:What l think here is we have a failure to deal an honest hand.
LEADMALE:Hey, you're accusing me of cheating? I'm telling you're accusing me of cheating, no.
LEADMALE:I'm just saying you got a face so ugly a coyote should beat it out with a stick.
LEADMALE:I'm telling you.
LEADMALE:You're telling me that? Don't you talk to me like that.
SUPFEMALE:Yep.
LEADFEMALE:Yup, that's what I said.
SUPFEMALE:Happy trails to you Oh, stuff it, Roy, and I don't mean Trigger.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you understand? There's a lot of stuff going down here.
LEADFEMALE:You'll never go on here.
SUPFEMALE:- What's he saying? - I don't know.
LEADMALE:All right, the rest of you.
LEADMALE:Come on, quit hiding from it.
OTHERFEMALE:They're not doing diddly.
LEADMALE:Let's get down to the action.
LEADMALE:That did it, you all done it now.
SUPMALE:You've had it now.
LEADMALE:Watch out, Billy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Billy, that seem like fun to you? No, it's pretty scary.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's just what Uncle Mork wanted to hear.
LEADFEMALE:I guess we can head on home now and talk about this one later.
LEADFEMALE:- Remember this for when we're older.
OTHERMALE:- Nope.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Mayday.
OTHERFEMALE:Amrak.
SUPFEMALE:All systems alert.
LEADFEMALE:Damien, Part Four.
SUPMALE:- It's all over, Mork.
LEADMALE:- No, no, Billy.
LEADMALE:No, wait.
LEADMALE:I won.
LEADFEMALE:- Billy the Kid did it again.
LEADFEMALE:- What--? What happened? Mork.
SUPMALE:What happened? Hey, get up, Mork.
LEADMALE:The game's over.
LEADMALE:Look, violence isn't a game, Billy.
LEADMALE:But it was just pretend.
LEADMALE:Mork, are you all right? Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, is Billy nearby? I can't see too clearly.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:I think he needs a doctor.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, I wish my dad were here, he's a doctor.
SUPFEMALE:There's a cold trough outside.
LEADMALE:l'll go get a cold washcloth.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Mork.
OTHERMALE:Mind, can you stop doing that? You're curling my eyebrows.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You mean, you're all right? Mind, as I fell through the air, l had this incredible idea.
SUPFEMALE:I thought I might just wing it, you know? I mean, Squellman had this incredible flair for the dramatic.
SUPMALE:I'm glad you're all right, but I think I'd like to wring your neck.
LEADMALE:This wasn't part of our plan.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, think Ghandi, nonviolence, nonviolence.
LEADMALE:We are not here, not be here now, if not, get there later.
LEADMALE:And to Mindy, I leave all of my Tupperware.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, don't die.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I went too far.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's all right, Billy.
LEADMALE:It was just a game.
LEADFEMALE:Kind of heavy stakes, but just a game.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Get better.
SUPFEMALE:I saw my dad do this, I hope it works.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I have a feeIing it will.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Yes, yes, yes.
LEADFEMALE:I'm healed.
SUPFEMALE:Praise the power.
OTHERFEMALE:I had a vision.
OTHERFEMALE:I saw the Cadillac was coming to carry me home.
SUPFEMALE:You did it, Billy.
SUPMALE:Praise you.
LEADFEMALE:I think you saved his life.
OTHERMALE:I did, didn't I? - I made Mork better.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yup.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you think you wanna be Billy the Kid anymore? No way.
SUPFEMALE:I've got a new hero now.
SUPFEMALE:Who's that, Bill? You, Mork.
LEADMALE:I'd better get home now, my mom and dad will be worried.
LEADFEMALE:Is it all right if I throw my bike in your Jeep? - Sure.
SUPFEMALE:- Better than the other way around.
OTHERFEMALE:Well Well, another day, another nervous breakdown.
SUPMALE:Hey, somebody left the Jeep lights on.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, Mind I know what you're thinking, but it was advanced planning, really, it was.
LEADFEMALE:I know we need those lights at night when we have to look for the car keys that I lost.
SUPMALE:- Oh, Mork.
SUPMALE:- I know, I know.
LEADMALE:Patience, Mind, patience.
LEADFEMALE:It's not only a virtue, in this case, it's a necessity.
LEADFEMALE:I'll wait for you outside.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Thanks, fellas.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in there, partner.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, bronco belly, where are you? - Mork, get a grip on yourself.
SUPFEMALE:- Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:It's just me and my sidekick Beebs here, H'Orson around, sir.
LEADMALE:Get it, H'Orson around? One more, Mr.
LEADMALE:Beebs.
SUPFEMALE:That's funny, he didn't get it this time.
LEADMALE:What's your report about this week, Mork? Well, heroes, sir.
OTHERMALE:And I'm not talking sandwiches.
LEADFEMALE:Are there many heroes on Earth? Oh, yes, sir, there are.
SUPFEMALE:But it seems like only the ones with pizzazz seem to get the spotlight.
SUPFEMALE:How many times have you seen Albert Schweitzer on a bubblegum card? Think about that one, sir.
LEADMALE:Maybe he can't throw a good curve ball, but isn't that being a little picky? lt sounds like Earthlings equate heroism with glamorous deeds.
OTHERFEMALE:l think so, sir, it's probably good for their T-shirt industry.
LEADFEMALE:You always hear about the man who jumps over 1 3 buses, but you never hear about the John Doe that put him back together again.
LEADMALE:- Who's John Doe? - Exactly, sir.
LEADMALE:That's why I think most real heroes seldom get a headline of their own.
LEADMALE:Imagine this, sir.
LEADMALE:Today millions of Earthlings helped one another.
OTHERMALE:No film at 1 1 .
OTHERFEMALE:And that's all she wrote, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:We'll get back to you next week if we get that grant from the Chrysler Foundation.
LEADMALE:Na-no, na-no.
LEADFEMALE:It's cute, you'll like it.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, it's got a nice feel.
OTHERMALE:Cathy, I was just saying to Dad that we hardly get a chance to see you two anymore, you're gone so often.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:I have missed our wicked little stepmother-stepdaughter talks.
LEADMALE:But it really has been a busy concert season.
SUPMALE:I'll say, Cathy plays wonderful flute.
SUPMALE:But maybe I've been working her too hard.
OTHERFEMALE:Lately, she's been eating her celery like this: Hey, you didn't finish your eggplant.
SUPFEMALE:All right, shoot it to me straight.
SUPFEMALE:It's too spicy, too much garlic, not enough rosemary.
OTHERMALE:Is that right? No, it was delicious, Remo, I'm just watching my figure.
LEADMALE:You don't have to.
LEADFEMALE:Every guy in the place is watching it for you.
SUPMALE:You lucky old dog, you.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't mean old.
LEADMALE:I meant Well, you're older than me.
OTHERMALE:Well, excuse me while I go away flustered.
SUPFEMALE:What's happened to Mork? Wasn't he going out to check the movie times? The phone's right outside, it shouldn't take him 20 minutes to call the theatre.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, I'm so excited.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna go see a movie.
LEADMALE:I hope it's a musical comedy with an RR rating.
LEADMALE:Well, what took you so long? Well, I was on the phone with this wonderful woman.
SUPMALE:She gave me all the times for the theatres.
LEADMALE:I would've been here earlier, except she kept repeating herself, and I didn't wanna hang up.
OTHERFEMALE:It might be rude.
SUPMALE:Mork, I think that was a recording.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Well, it'll never make the top ten.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's got a nice beat, but it's hard to dance to.
SUPFEMALE:I've got all the theatre times right here, Mind.
LEADMALE:There are 1 4 theatres where it's playing.
LEADMALE:At Cinema 1 , at 6, 8, and 1 0.
LEADMALE:Cinema 2 at 7, 9 and 1 1 .
SUPFEMALE:- Cinema 3 at-- - What time does our movie start? - I'll get back to you in 20 minutes.
OTHERMALE:- No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just drive over there and take our chances.
OTHERMALE:You know, Mork, I can never tell when you're serious.
LEADMALE:Oh, neither can I, but it's usually when I go like this: - I'm looking forward to seeing 1 0.
SUPMALE:- 1 0? If I'd known we were gonna see 1 0, I'd have my suspenders cornrowed.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I saw the movie when Fred was out of town, and it's so funny I wanted him to see it too.
OTHERMALE:That sounds a little far-fetched.
SUPMALE:I mean, who would believe an attractive, young woman falling for an older, middle-aged man Well, maybe art does tend to imitate life.
LEADFEMALE:Fred? Fred McConnell? Bob Turnbow.
LEADFEMALE:- I haven't seen you since high school.
LEADFEMALE:- Hey.
SUPMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Say, I'd like you to meet my wife, Cathy, and my daughter, Mindy, and my Mork.
LEADFEMALE:That's me, na-no.
SUPFEMALE:- Pleased to meet you, Bob.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi.
SUPFEMALE:God, Fred, your wife, she's beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Very beautiful.
OTHERMALE:Hey, you old dog.
LEADMALE:How did you meet her? Was she helping you cross the street? Just kidding.
LEADMALE:I always have enjoyed your sense of humour, Bob.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, me too, Bob.
LEADFEMALE:Look under the hat for another surprise.
LEADMALE:Bob.
LEADMALE:Say, Bob, you know, it's amazing, but you look the same as you did years ago.
LEADFEMALE:Exactly the same.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll tell you my secret, Fred.
SUPMALE:Plastic surgery.
LEADFEMALE:Changed my whole life.
LEADFEMALE:I improved my best parts and threw out all the rest.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, I gotta run.
SUPFEMALE:Say goodbye to that beautiful young wife of yours, will you? Listen, I'm sorry I gotta fly, but I'm meeting my date at Rawhide's.
LEADFEMALE:We're riding double on the mechanical bull.
LEADFEMALE:Yahoo.
SUPFEMALE:Improved his best parts.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd be happy with what he threw away.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, cheer up, Pops.
LEADMALE:You know, wine improves with age, cheese improves with age.
LEADFEMALE:It's not your fault that you're not wine or cheese.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Beebs, try another trick.
OTHERFEMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Play dead.
OTHERMALE:Oh, those amazing noggachomps.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wonderful, Bebo.
SUPMALE:You was rigour mortis there-- There's an Earthling at the door, Beebs.
SUPFEMALE:Either slip into your Boomer costume or take a hike.
LEADMALE:Come on, Beebs.
SUPFEMALE:Beebs, hurry.
LEADFEMALE:Go on, fetch.
SUPMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:- Pops.
LEADMALE:- Oh, hi, Mork.
LEADMALE:Is Mindy home? Oh, no.
LEADMALE:She's in the tub right now with Mr.
SUPMALE:Suds.
SUPFEMALE:What I wanna talk to her about, it's kind of personal.
LEADMALE:Personal? Oh, I see.
LEADMALE:It's part of your McConnell life that I can't McShare.
LEADFEMALE:It's all right.
LEADMALE:I understand after I insulted you last night at the restaurant that Well, even though I was doing it in friendship that I can accept this, I can.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I can accept it.
LEADMALE:I can even live with it.
SUPMALE:He hates me.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:- No, no, no.
SUPMALE:- I don't need your pity.
LEADMALE:- Mork, Mork, Mork.
LEADMALE:I didn't mean to offend you, I just I'm just troubled about something.
LEADMALE:Oh, I've always hoped that you'd look to me as a son, because I've always looked to you as, well, Mindy's father.
LEADFEMALE:Let's seize this moment to make our relationship closer.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me in, Fred.
LEADFEMALE:Well Okay.
LEADMALE:Now, this is just between you and me, Mork.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:I've been to a plastic surgeon.
LEADMALE:Why? Couldn't you find a real one? She is a real one.
LEADFEMALE:Dr.
LEADMALE:Charlotte Dubin, she's one of the best.
OTHERMALE:You see, I'm 1 5 years older than Cathy.
SUPMALE:And while I can't make myself her age, I can make myself a lot younger.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you mean, you humans can change your appearance.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this will make an interesting report to Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure, everybody's doing it.
LEADMALE:You can lift your eyes, and fill in your chin, and fill out your cheeks.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's wonderful.
LEADMALE:Could they move your nose down here? It'd be convenient next to your hanky.
SUPMALE:I'm doing this for Cathy.
OTHERMALE:I spent a lot of years alone.
LEADMALE:And now that I have her, I'm gonna do anything I can to keep her interested in me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Pops.
LEADMALE:I mean, I'm sure she likes you the way you are.
SUPMALE:I do.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Mork.
SUPMALE:Oh, shucks and wazoo, you know? But there's nothing wrong in looking your best, especially for somebody you love.
LEADMALE:Well, anyway, thanks for listening, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure you don't wanna tell Mind? lt's wonderful news.
LEADFEMALE:On second thought, l've gotten it off my chest now.
SUPMALE:l'll just save it for later and surprise her.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you've really helped me make up my mind.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow at 4:00, I'm gonna be a new man.
LEADMALE:Well, now that we've helped you remove your troubles, there's something I've always wondered about.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think Orson Welles should be made into a national park? You know, I've often wondered about that too.
LEADMALE:So long, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mork.
LEADMALE:Have you seen my eyeliner pencil? Oh, yes.
SUPMALE:I was using it to play connect-the-dot on my chest.
LEADMALE:It was amazing.
LEADFEMALE:It made this picture of Marie Osmond with hairy teeth.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet it did.
OTHERMALE:Well, I need it to complete my makeup.
SUPMALE:Makeup.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, would you stain the Painted Desert? Would you flock the giant redwoods? Would you fill the Grand Canyon with Cheez Whiz? I say, nay, nay, nay.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, well, thank you very much.
LEADMALE:No, no, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:You see, you're very, very special.
OTHERMALE:I mean, the way your nose kind of veers to the left.
LEADFEMALE:And the way your eyes sparkle, especially the greener one.
LEADMALE:The way your chin comes to that point, so convenient for opening beer cans.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thank you, Mork, but we all could use a little improvement.
OTHERFEMALE:Especially for those you care about.
LEADMALE:Right, Mind? - Right.
LEADMALE:- Mind - Remember the movie we saw, 1 0? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:Who's your perfect ten? Well, present company excepted.
SUPMALE:Oh, bless you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess there are always the old standbys: Newman, Redford and Cronkite.
SUPFEMALE:But I always thought that I always thought that maybe I'd like to meet a guy like my dad.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess through my eyes, he's always sort of been the perfect ten to me.
LEADMALE:I gotta dry my hair, I'm gonna be late.
LEADMALE:Oh, allow me, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Allow me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you do hair too? Oh, honey, I do anything I can.
SUPMALE:Wash up for you now here.
SUPMALE:Let's just give you a little blow-dry here.
LEADFEMALE:That's all we can afford today.
LEADFEMALE:Let's work on it now.
LEADMALE:First, we'll tease it.
LEADMALE:Yesterday, this woman came in and she said: ''Make me look like Cheryl Tiegs.
LEADMALE:'' I said, ''Honey, I'm a beautician, not a magician.
OTHERMALE:'' Come on, now.
LEADMALE:Boy, she-- I can tell you.
LEADMALE:She wanted me to give her a facial.
LEADMALE:I said, ''I don't have a sandblaster.
LEADMALE:'' Oh, whoa, this is incredible.
SUPMALE:I looked at this other lady came in, and she liked to look like the Bo Derek.
LEADMALE:So I said to her, I put like magnetic beads in her hair, and she followed a bus for a mile.
LEADMALE:That's it, one more blow-dry.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, there you are, you're all done.
LEADMALE:Get back on the street.
LEADMALE:- Oh, thank you, Mr.
LEADMALE:Mork.
SUPMALE:- Oh, bless you, child.
LEADFEMALE:- Thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:- Bless you.
OTHERMALE:Susan B.
LEADMALE:Anthony.
SUPMALE:Well, I guess I could use a little improvement.
LEADMALE:All those years of sitting on my face are beginning to show.
OTHERFEMALE:I never should have sat on wicker.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess this is it.
SUPMALE:Pops said I should do it for someone I care about.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I'll do it for Mind.
LEADMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:That's right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna do it.
SUPMALE:Mork's new look.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I'll be like Dianne von Secondburg.
OTHERFEMALE:Will someone loosen my hair so I can blink? You have to let them know you're here.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:I'm here! Oh, voice-activated shutters.
LEADFEMALE:May I help you? Oh, yes.
OTHERMALE:Hello, doc.
SUPFEMALE:- I've got a list of changes I'd like done.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, no, I'm not Dr.
LEADMALE:Dubin.
LEADMALE:No, I'm the receptionist.
LEADMALE:- What's your name? - Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that your first name or your last name? Yes, it is.
LEADFEMALE:- I see.
LEADFEMALE:- No, I-C spells ic.
SUPMALE:- M-O-R-K spells Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, you must be the man who called in and wanted the doctor to shoot the works.
SUPFEMALE:That's me, M-E.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Well, the doctor will be with you in a few minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:See? It worked the same way.
OTHERMALE:Like a charm, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Wouldn't it be funny if the Broncos played the Colts? They'd have to call a foal.
LEADFEMALE:Is this doctor any good? Oh, she certainly is.
OTHERFEMALE:She helped my husband when he had his crow's feet.
SUPFEMALE:Crow's feet.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, those can really tear up the carpet, can't they? Let me guess.
SUPFEMALE:Your husband had crow's feet.
SUPFEMALE:You have frog's legs.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, I'm getting her nose.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, really? You know what I'd say if I were her? What do you wanna do that for? I didn't mean to make fun of you.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you having done? Well, I'm shooting the works.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna have my face tucked, my cheeks pinched and my bags packed.
LEADMALE:Sir, the doctor will see you now.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Good luck.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, everything will be fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Would you like to go in there and have a seat? Oh, a seat? No, thanks, that part's okay.
LEADMALE:Mindy, have you noticed anything strange about your dad? Strange? No, why? Well, he's been acting a little unusual lately.
SUPMALE:Like the other day, he asked me if I thought he would look younger with his fringe permed.
OTHERMALE:- Dad said that? - Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:He passed it off as a joke, but I'm not so sure.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I wouldn't worry about it.
OTHERMALE:He's probably going through a little phase.
SUPMALE:I hope so.
LEADMALE:The other night, we were sitting in front of the fireplace sipping wine.
LEADFEMALE:It was very romantic.
SUPMALE:And he looked me right in the eye and he said: ''Cathy, darling, do you realise when you're 65, I'll be dead?'' That sounds like the middle-aged crazies.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know what's making him act this way.
SUPMALE:I really have never said anything to make him defensive about his age.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, listen, Cathy, you're the best thing that's ever happened to Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe he feels like he doesn't deserve you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mindy, any woman would be lucky to have a man like your father.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe he just needs to hear that a little more often.
SUPFEMALE:But it's so obvious.
LEADMALE:I mean, I even told Mork this morning.
OTHERFEMALE:- Mork? - Yes.
SUPMALE:He came over to borrow a cup of Liquid-Plumr.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, then he asked me, ''What do you think is a perfect ten?'' And I said, Fred.
SUPFEMALE:You know, that's funny, he asked me the same question.
SUPMALE:And I gave him the same answer.
LEADMALE:Well, hi, Lola and Stephanie, what a surprise.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mindy.
LEADMALE:We came over to see Mork.
LEADMALE:Do you have any ice cream you're not using? Well, yeah, there's some over there in the fridge.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:No, Lola, Mork hasn't gotten home yet.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I wanted to see how he turned out.
LEADMALE:Oh, did you know him when he was a little boy? Your friend has a delightful sense of the absurd.
SUPMALE:- This is Cathy.
LEADMALE:- Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Lola, what did you mean by how Mork turned out? He left the daycare centre early today to go to a plastic surgeon.
LEADMALE:- A plastic surgeon? - What for? I heard him say he was going to shoot the works.
LEADMALE:Shoot the works? Did he happen to mention what doctor he was gonna go see? Sure, he called from the centre.
SUPMALE:- It was Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Dubin.
LEADMALE:- Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Dubin.
SUPFEMALE:Great, thanks a lot, Lola.
LEADMALE:You've been a big help.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just look it up in the phone book.
SUPFEMALE:I hope Mork doesn't get too many things changed.
LEADFEMALE:He had such a charming Chaplinesque quality.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Stephanie.
OTHERFEMALE:And you know you're out of whipped cream again.
OTHERMALE:I hope we're not too late.
LEADMALE:Fred? Dad.
LEADFEMALE:How's my little girl? Did you bring him here? Him? Who him? - Mork.
LEADMALE:- No.
OTHERMALE:Nice talking to you.
SUPMALE:Fred, who did you bring here? Just little old me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what would you be doing at a plastic surgeon's? What would you be doing at a plastic surgeon's? Well, we came here looking for Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:What would Mork be doing at a plastic surgeon? He doesn't have bags under his eyes.
LEADMALE:Oh, Fred, what are you talking about? May I help you? No.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I like the way I look.
LEADFEMALE:A friend of mine came here named Mork? Yes, Mork, I remember him.
SUPFEMALE:He's the guy that asked for some changes that would make Mr.
SUPMALE:Potato Head proud.
SUPMALE:What did he have done? Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Patient information is confidential.
LEADMALE:She said that Mork was here, but he left.
LEADFEMALE:Where would Mork get the idea that he needed plastic surgery? Got me.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess he got the idea from me.
LEADMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Well, we'd better get home.
OTHERFEMALE:Lord knows what he's had done.
SUPMALE:I swear I didn't know anything about it.
LEADFEMALE:Cancel my appointment, I'll be back later.
LEADFEMALE:Anything you say, handsome.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork, are you there? - No, I'm here, you're there.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing in the armoire? I'm just waiting for you to come home, so I can make a grand entrance.
LEADFEMALE:Why haven't I gotten used to moments like these? Hi, hon.
SUPFEMALE:How's my little girl? Cathy, you look great.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, hon.
LEADFEMALE:You look great too.
LEADMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:You know, he does look vaguely familiar.
OTHERMALE:You know, he does look vaguely familiar.
SUPFEMALE:Now, cut that out.
LEADFEMALE:Now, cut that out.
LEADFEMALE:Mork.
SUPMALE:You see, it's the latest thing from the Yves St.
LEADFEMALE:La Fred.
LEADFEMALE:Notice the new wraparound hairline that any Hare Krishna would envy.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, what are you doing? Well, when I'm not dropping in on my perky daughter and her madcap roommate, I'm home with my lovely wife, Cathy, and saying, ''How's my love kitten?'' - Mork.
SUPMALE:- Mork.
LEADFEMALE:I feel like I'm listening to bald stereo.
LEADMALE:We thought you'd done something ridiculous at the plastic surgeon.
LEADFEMALE:No, the doctor laughed me out of the office, so I had to do something ridiculous on my own.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Where did you get that thing? Pierre Trudeau.
LEADMALE:Margaret said it was one of his throwaways.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mind, didn't fool you? Well, you had me going for a minute, but the latex stretch marks gave you away.
LEADFEMALE:That's very cute, Mork, but why are you me? Well, you always said that you have to look better for those you care about.
LEADMALE:And both Cathy and Mindy said that you were a ten.
SUPFEMALE:And I thought, well, with all my other qualities, I might be an 1 1 .
LEADMALE:Oh, I guess I've done wrong, haven't I? No, Mork.
SUPMALE:We just like you better the way you were.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I see.
SUPFEMALE:I've made another mistake.
LEADFEMALE:I've bitten the big watata again.
LEADFEMALE:That's all right.
LEADFEMALE:If I only had a broom, I could leave here like Emmett Kelly.
LEADFEMALE:It's all right.
LEADMALE:Pathetic figure departs.
SUPMALE:Excuse me while I go help my pathetic friend.
LEADMALE:You said I was a ten? With a capital T.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Now, look, I know what you're thinking.
OTHERMALE:That a wife has a right to know when her husband is gonna rotate his parts.
SUPMALE:But look, you're so pretty, and you're Well, all right, I'll say it.
LEADMALE:You're so young.
OTHERMALE:I mean, you don't even have a wrinkle.
LEADMALE:You don't even pucker when you soak.
LEADFEMALE:Are you finished, old-timer? - Yes.
LEADFEMALE:- Sit down, Fred.
SUPFEMALE:If you wanna have plastic surgery, that's fine.
LEADMALE:- It is? - Sure.
LEADMALE:If you're doing it for you.
LEADMALE:But if you're doing it to look better for me, then you're making a big mistake.
LEADFEMALE:But I wanna feel like I belong with you.
LEADFEMALE:Fred, you are the most beautiful man in the world.
SUPMALE:You're kind, you're loving, you're sensitive, and it's written all over your face.
LEADFEMALE:Don't erase a line.
LEADMALE:That's the nicest thing you ever said to me.
LEADFEMALE:Something's wrong, Mind, they're not even talking.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess we'd better be going.
OTHERMALE:Yes, it's getting late, it's almost 7:30.
LEADMALE:Seven-thirty, Mind.
SUPMALE:Listen, I just want you to know that I've taken another look at this face.
LEADFEMALE:And you know something? It ain't so bad after all.
LEADMALE:And, Mork, next time you do me, I use my left hand when I say: ''How's my little girl?'' How's my little girl? - Goodbye, kids.
SUPFEMALE:- Yeah, we two tens are going home.
SUPMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:- Cute couple, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, aren't they? Well, it's almost 7:30, huh? You know what that means, don't you? No, do you? Brady Bunch reruns.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Your Beer-Belliness.
LEADFEMALE:Roll out the Orson Thank you, Judy and Cissy, for that lovely melody.
LEADMALE:lt is customary, Mork, to respect one's superiors.
LEADFEMALE:Hear that, Beeb? No gratitude from His Fatitude.
SUPMALE:- Give a little latitude and-- - Your report, Mork.
SUPMALE:This week, sir, I learned that Earthlings can change their appearance.
LEADMALE:They wear shoes to make them taller, girdles to make them thinner, wigs to make them hairier.
LEADFEMALE:Then they say, ''Darling, why can't you accept me for what I am?'' - Bizarre.
LEADMALE:- Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:And their bizarres are padded also.
LEADFEMALE:Wait till you hear this, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Some Earthlings go to doctors to have bumps removed from their noses, and you won't believe where they put them.
LEADFEMALE:Do these changes make humans look better, Mork? I don't know about that, but they must make them feel better.
OTHERMALE:But I think some of these changes are unnecessary.
LEADFEMALE:You see, most Earthlings change themselves because they don't think they look good to others when the real problem is they don't look good enough to themselves.
LEADFEMALE:Pity, huh? On that, sir, good night, and until next week.
SUPMALE:Na-no, na-no.
LEADMALE:Finally, the crew of the Calypso and mys elf.
LEADFEMALE:These boys have been at sea for a  long time.
OTHERMALE:We're finally  looking for the great white in dangerous waters.
LEADFEMALE:They say this is the  black h ole, the deep trench.
SUPFEMALE:We don't know why we are here, but they pay us, we go anyway.
LEADMALE:It is a very dangerous search so I send F alco down, my assistant.
LEADMALE:No,  please, Jacques, no.
LEADFEMALE:Quiet, F alco, when you have your own speci als, you can give me stuff.
LEADFEMALE:But,  please, no.
SUPFEMALE:No,  please.
OTHERFEMALE:No, must I go down? Yes, you must go down there now.
OTHERFEMALE:No,  please, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you see down there, F alco? What does it  look  like there? What did you say? All right, now, F alco, what do you see when I send down this sucker to h elp you with your search? H old on there.
LEADFEMALE:At  last, we have found him.
OTHERMALE:Erik Estrada.
LEADFEMALE:Stunning.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:There you are, the great Jaws hims elf.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:No, you want to get it? It's all right? Good.
LEADFEMALE:Howdy, howdy, howdy, friend, and, hey, how are you doing? Ernest Travers is my name.
SUPFEMALE:Insurance is my game.
SUPMALE:Oh, good hands.
LEADMALE:Where is your fire hat and your  little moose? My name is Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, let me tell you something, buddy.
SUPMALE:Today, today, Mr.
LEADMALE:Mork, is your  lucky day.
LEADMALE:- Oh, really? - Do you wanna know why? Is David Brenner not hosting The Tonight Show? Even better, buddy.
LEADFEMALE:We are t alking about protection.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I know about protection.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, Mr.
LEADMALE:Mork, you can have a choice here.
OTHERFEMALE:You can either  learn to dance or talk  slowly.
LEADMALE:You can get 1 00 do-- I said, $1 00 a day, and all you gotta do is get seriou sly injured.
LEADMALE:Why, do you re alise that one out of four peo ple get hospit alised every year? Oh, what is this? - Some kind of setup for a sick joke? - No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Friend, it's perfec tly true.
LEADMALE:Why, seven peo ple have gotten sick just as I've been t alking to you.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we sho uld be t alking in sign  language.
LEADMALE:- And that's not all.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, sir.
SUPMALE:Why, there are over 4 million automob ile accidents every year.
LEADMALE:Not to mention fires and earthquakes.
LEADMALE:- And twisters.
LEADMALE:- Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:A big  old twister of '4 7 screwed my granny right into the ground.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:Mondo Irwin Allen.
LEADMALE:But, son, you will be protected with our coverage for just a few mea sly pennies a day.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, who cares? Where do I sign? - Where do I sign? - Right here.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:- Right there.
LEADFEMALE:- Right there.
SUPMALE:- Hi.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind.
LEADMALE:Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Do you wanna sign here, buddy? - Who's your friend? - Howdy, ma'am.
OTHERMALE:Honest Ernest Travers, Pikes Peak C alamity and Auto.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice to meet you.
SUPFEMALE:Do you wanna sign here? Mork, you never sign anything before you read it.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mind, I might go belly up between the O and the R.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
OTHERMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, I really don't think you can afford insurance.
LEADMALE:Sure I can.
SUPFEMALE:It only costs a few mea sly pennies.
SUPFEMALE:The ones with President Mea sly on them.
SUPMALE:How many mea sly pennies? Now, madam, you cannot put a price tag on coverage  like this.
OTHERMALE:How much? Oh, about 300 a month, but he's protected from any disaster.
SUPMALE:Do you  please wanna sign this thing,  please? Gotta have this in case mea tloaf falls on me.
LEADFEMALE:I don't wanna end up as a Hamburger H elper.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:- Trust me, trust me, friend.
LEADFEMALE:Now, your he alth and w elfare is our o nly concern.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't have any money.
SUPMALE:Thank you very much and goodbye.
LEADMALE:You can't just  leave after scaring the bejeebies out of me.
LEADMALE:- Bye-bye.
OTHERFEMALE:- Bye-bye, bye.
LEADMALE:Mindy, he said bye.
OTHERFEMALE:Mind, I don't think-- White man come, take Bic.
LEADMALE:Mind, I needed that protection.
SUPFEMALE:Why wo uldn't you  let me get it? Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:On Earth, some s alesmen aren't  always ethic al.
LEADMALE:Besides, it sounds  like he was using scare tactics to talk you into something you don't need.
LEADFEMALE:It worked.
SUPFEMALE:There might be something awful  lurking outside the door.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, there's nothing lurking outside the door that wasn't there  last night.
LEADFEMALE:You're not sure? Behind you.
LEADFEMALE:- You didn't fall for it, eh? - No.
LEADFEMALE:Come on,  let's make the chec klist for the trip.
OTHERMALE:You're gonna  love Yellowstone this time of year.
LEADFEMALE:- It's so pretty.
SUPFEMALE:- Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Especially this time This time of year is winter, isn't it, Mind? Don't peo ple freeze their klarns off in winter? We're gonna be staying in a nice, warm  lodge.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's better, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Nice, warm-- Well, co uldn't that  lodge get re al warm if it burned down, Mind? It's not gonna burn down.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah? What happens if some big Boy Scout rubs two rooms together? Mork, we've been  planning this trip for weeks now.
LEADMALE:You don't wanna disappoint N elson and  Glenda, do you? - Maybe.
SUPFEMALE:- That s alesman made you paranoid.
SUPFEMALE:Why do you say that, Mind? If you think about it  logically, what could possibly happen to you? - Come on, really.
LEADMALE:- Yeah, you're right.
OTHERMALE:Be  logical, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:You know how kind of cute and cuddly I am? What if one of those big griz zly bears decides to take a Morky doll to bed? I mean, they  sleep all winter.
SUPFEMALE:What happens if it comes spring? I don't wanna wake up as Smokey's fiance.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bic kley, where's Mork? I got your  lunch.
LEADMALE:Well, he's calling the weather service in Yokohama.
SUPMALE:He wanted to see if a tid al wave was headed for Boulder.
LEADMALE:A tid al wave in Bo ulder.
LEADMALE:Wow, that's great.
SUPMALE:Listen, what is Mork so anxious about, anyway? Modern  living.
OTHERMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, are you all right? I mean, compared to your norm al level of strangeness.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Today is but a foetus.
SUPMALE:- I  almost met Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Reaper.
LEADFEMALE:It was grim.
SUPFEMALE:- What happened? Well, I was out there making a phone call, and a  block away, a van swerved and hit a wall.
LEADFEMALE:- What does that have to do with you? - A month ago, I was at the same spot.
LEADFEMALE:And if it wasn't for December, I'd be decomposing right now, just like Mozart.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:- You understand, don't you? - Oh, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, it's everywhere.
SUPMALE:I'm okay.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I feel safe here.
LEADMALE:I do, I really do.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know why.
LEADMALE:It's getting so we're not safe anywhere.
LEADMALE:Look how we're polluting the air.
SUPMALE:A guy I know last year shot a duck and it took it three days to hit the ground.
LEADMALE:That poor dog  slipped a disc waiting for that sucker to fall.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I better stop breathing.
LEADMALE:- You might as well stop eating too.
OTHERMALE:- Why, what's wrong with the food? Well, there's  always some he alth faddist  claiming food has stuff in it that's dangerous.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERMALE:No wonder they say a prayer before every me al.
SUPFEMALE:Why, even this  plate co uld be coated with toxic, lead-based paint.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody, hit the deck! This  plate's about to go off! Watch out! Hey, that  plate cost me 5 pesos.
LEADMALE:Of course we're civ ilised men.
LEADMALE:Besides, there's no  place to hide.
LEADFEMALE:The wo rld, as we know it, is coming to an end.
LEADFEMALE:And me without a chick.
LEADFEMALE:- Exidor.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork.
OTHERMALE:Is that you? One moment.
SUPMALE:Boys, wh ile we chat, go loot the bathroom.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you say the wo rld was coming to an end? No, I said that.
SUPMALE:Proof: I was just struck by this meteor from the M elmac g alaxy.
SUPFEMALE:Do you b elieve this guy? Well, I've seen cham eleons with a better grasp on reality.
LEADFEMALE:Those cynics will be foss ils in two hours.
SUPMALE:The wo rld will be over at 4:00.
LEADFEMALE:Three o' clock, Centr al Time.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I'm gonna miss you, you big loon.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, you're my dearest Let's do something that will make this moment last an eternity.
LEADFEMALE:Well, forget eternity.
LEADMALE:What about the next ten seconds? Well, we co uld say: I've got everything we need right here.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, don't you think you're a little over-prepared for a trip to Yellowstone? What trip? I'm staying here.
LEADFEMALE:You're staying here? Well, then, what's that stuff for? I'm prepared for every c alamity imagina ble.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this, I have a snakebite kit.
LEADMALE:I have shark repellent.
OTHERFEMALE:- Foghorn, a mosquito net.
SUPMALE:- Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Highway  flares.
LEADMALE:Don't stop me now, Mind, I'm on a roll.
LEADMALE:We've got a pe nlight in case we fall into a  black h ole.
OTHERFEMALE:Watch out.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:H elp me now, h elp me now.
LEADFEMALE:And some Handi-Wipes in case we get attacked by a  flock of fried chicken.
LEADMALE:There's no chance we're gonna fall into a  black h ole and o nly a 50-50 chance we'll be attacked by fried chicken.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, I prepared for the reg ular c alamities too, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Your famine, your pest ilence, your fire.
LEADMALE:You forgot the ever-pop ular  flood.
LEADFEMALE:You thought you had me there, Princess Hokum? No way.
LEADFEMALE:I'm prepared for that too, Mind.
LEADMALE:Watch this.
LEADMALE:Yes, sir.
SUPFEMALE:lt's Morko's Noah's ark.
LEADFEMALE:I have anim als outside, two by two.
LEADMALE:They are coming to audition, bringing 5-by-4s.
LEADMALE:Hello, my name is Ca rl, I'm a squirr el.
LEADFEMALE:This is my wife, L ola.
OTHERMALE:See, I'm gonna ignore all this.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go to the store and buy some hiking boots.
LEADMALE:And you are coming with me on that trip.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Well, you've ove rlooked one vit al statistic.
LEADMALE:The statistics say that more accidents occur in the home than any place  else.
OTHERFEMALE:So think how much safer you'll be with me in Yellowstone.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not safe out there.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not safe in here.
SUPMALE:I'm not safe anywhere.
OTHERMALE:I want my test tube.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, I got the hiking boots.
SUPMALE:What are the lights out for? I co uldn't reach the switch, Mind.
LEADMALE:What do you mean, you co uldn't reach the switch? What in the world is that? It's a surviv al condo, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I've finally found a  place where I'm safe.
SUPMALE:I'm never coming out.
LEADMALE:This is ridic ulous.
LEADMALE:No, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a hermetically-se aled, germ-free, antiseptic life-support unit.
SUPMALE:It's kind of like a womb with a view.
LEADFEMALE:How do you like it, Mind? I got the  plans from Better Homes and Shelters.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't it wonderf ul? Mindy, you can go on with your life as usu al.
LEADFEMALE:Just don't peek in here when I'm in my undies.
LEADMALE:Mork, where wo uld you ever get a crazy idea like this? It's not crazy.
OTHERFEMALE:We used this on Ork during the famous swine- flu epidemic.
LEADFEMALE:It kept pigs from bouncing on us.
LEADMALE:Now you know why their noses are so  flat.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you can't stay in here forever.
SUPMALE:Oh, por que, Mind, por que? Listen, this is wonderf ul in here.
LEADFEMALE:At last, I've finally found a  place where I'm safe.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing can harm me, gives me 24-hour protection, doesn't even stain my clothes.
SUPFEMALE:- You'll just withdraw from the world? - You've got it.
LEADMALE:You're gonna hide in your shell, trem bling with fear at anything that co uld possi bly hurt you? All right, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you where you can get one of your own.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you're gonna have to come out sooner or later.
LEADFEMALE:No, I don't.
LEADFEMALE:I've got enough provisions in here for nine or ten bleams.
SUPMALE:Look at this here.
OTHERMALE:I've got canned water.
SUPMALE:Isn't that incredi ble, canned water? Open it up, there's water inside.
LEADFEMALE:Watch out, Mind.
LEADMALE:Hey, tell you what.
OTHERFEMALE:There's room in here for two.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, you'll be finally safe.
OTHERFEMALE:But I'm out here and I'm all right.
OTHERMALE:Anyway, everybody's exposed to those things you're so afraid of.
SUPFEMALE:We'll see who's laughing a hundred years from now.
LEADFEMALE:When everybody  else is going, ''H elp me.
LEADMALE:'' I'll be going, ''I'm young.
LEADFEMALE:'' Don't you see what is happening to you? Yes, I'm protected.
SUPFEMALE:- You're paranoid.
LEADFEMALE:- I'm inv ulnera ble.
LEADMALE:- You're untoucha ble.
SUPFEMALE:- I'm safe.
LEADFEMALE:- You're  alone.
LEADFEMALE:- I'm afraid.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid too, Mork.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid for you.
SUPMALE:Well, we've still got each other, huh? I guess something has finally come between us, huh? Big kiss.
LEADFEMALE:You guys still  planning on going to Yellowstone tomorrow? Yeah, tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I bought this jacket.
LEADMALE:With my com plexion, I don't want anybody to confuse me with a snowman.
SUPMALE:It's gotta hurt when they jam that carrot in your face.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy, I really wish I was going with you guys.
LEADMALE:I can't get off work and I gotta study for my anatomy  class.
LEADMALE:Oh, speaking of anatomy, Mindy says I sho uldn't bring my bikini.
SUPFEMALE:Now, what do you think? Wear it,  Glenda,  please.
LEADFEMALE:Bikinis are very big this time of year in Yellowstone.
LEADMALE:N elson  Flavor, you're a sexist.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Are you really gonna go to Yellowstone with this guy? Wait a minute, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Are you two guys becoming an item here or what, huh? - Yes.
LEADMALE:- No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Jeanie, the freezer motor is busted again.
LEADFEMALE:Co uld you  please fix it? And hurry, the  clams are starting to open.
LEADMALE:A woman's work is never done.
LEADMALE:I was just kidding about the bikini.
LEADMALE:I wo uldn't want you to catch a c old.
SUPMALE:A one-piece wo uld be fine.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, guys.
OTHERMALE:- Hi, Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:- Hi, Mindy.
SUPMALE:Did Mork change his mind about the trip or is he still in his humidor? Yes.
LEADMALE:The last part.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think he's ever coming out.
LEADMALE:He just sits in there sipping his Tang.
SUPMALE:Well, it is a lit tle strange.
LEADMALE:If I were you, I wo uld look upon him as a big guppy and just be gratef ul you don't have to  clean that tank.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you guys, I fe el like we're  already spo iling the trip.
SUPMALE:You  already have.
LEADMALE:- N elson.
LEADFEMALE:- It's wrecked.
SUPFEMALE:No, really, maybe you sho uld make  plans without us.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, we haven't given up yet.
LEADMALE:I mean, we're bound to think of something.
SUPFEMALE:I'm telling you, I've tried everything.
LEADFEMALE:I've begged, I've  pleaded.
OTHERFEMALE:I've even tried using logic.
LEADFEMALE:Now, logic, that will never work.
LEADMALE:Mindy, you know, maybe you're paying too much attention to him.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah, if he wants is olation, I'll give him is olation.
SUPFEMALE:We'll all give him is olation.
LEADFEMALE:I've got a great idea.
SUPFEMALE:Do you guys think you can come over to my house around 8:00 tonight? We might be a ble to find a way to get Mork out of that  glass box.
SUPMALE:We'll just fight bizarre with bizarre.
LEADMALE:And if that doesn't work, we'll get Ella Fitzger ald to come over and hit a high note.
OTHERFEMALE:Expecting company, Mind? I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Oh, so  clean, I didn't even know it was there.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi, come on in.
SUPMALE:- Here we go.
LEADMALE: Glenda, N elson.
SUPMALE:If I knew you were coming, I wo uld have squeegeed my face.
OTHERMALE:Oh, what a great idea, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:A going-away party for Mork.
LEADMALE:A party for me? I hope there's a pony ride.
LEADFEMALE:Well, actually, N elson, it's a gone-away party.
LEADMALE:Gone, yes, but not forgotten.
SUPFEMALE:Too bad Mork had to go.
LEADMALE:He was so much fun at parties.
LEADMALE:Wait.
SUPMALE:I'm still here and I'm still fun at parties.
LEADMALE:Watch.
LEADFEMALE:Watch this, hey, watch this.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let's get this party started.
LEADMALE:Party down.
LEADFEMALE:I'll mix us up a lit tle punch.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get it.
SUPMALE:Shazbot, I did it again.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, Mindy, I'm sorry I'm late.
LEADFEMALE:I was gonna bring some forget-me-nots, but I got a break on this.
LEADFEMALE:The fellow it was for pulled through.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:I'm sure Mork wo uld have appreciated it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, but I'm still here.
OTHERMALE:I really am.
LEADMALE:I'm here.
LEADMALE:Yo.
LEADMALE:You know, it's so quiet here without him.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, it took some getting used to, but life does go on.
SUPFEMALE:- Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:- Mind.
LEADMALE:Punch, anybody? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bic kley? Nice idea.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Good  old Mork.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure gonna miss that little tyke.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure, he was strange, but that was his charm.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna miss his laugh.
LEADMALE:That certain: I'm gonna miss the way he wore his suspenders.
LEADFEMALE:- The way he wore his hat.
SUPMALE:- What hat? The way he sang off-key.
LEADMALE:That's it, that's it.
SUPMALE:The memory of all that, no, no, they can't take that away from me.
SUPMALE:Cheers.
SUPMALE:Wait.
OTHERMALE:If Rod Serling w alks in this door, I'm gonna hatch a brick, I know I am.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I didn't know him as long as the rest of you did, but I have one re al regret.
OTHERMALE:I just wish he wo uldn't have gone away before I found out what shazbot meant.
SUPFEMALE:If you talk to me, I'll tell you what shazbot means.
LEADMALE:I'll even tell you what klarns are.
SUPMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:Bic kley, didn't you have something you wanted to say? Funny you sho uld mention it.
LEADFEMALE:I just happen to have a lit tle gem here from Mork's favourite greeting-card writer.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Bick.
LEADFEMALE:- Me.
LEADFEMALE:An Ode to Mork.
LEADFEMALE:To my friend, l say, bon voyage l can offer but this verbal corsage l loved his eyes, l loved his nose but now l hope l get his clothes Oh, that was so wonderf ul.
SUPFEMALE:I'm beginning to miss mys elf.
LEADFEMALE:You know-- Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:I'm still here.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mind, joke's over.
OTHERMALE:- Come on.
LEADFEMALE:- There's something I'd like to say.
LEADFEMALE:The Mork we all knew and loved is no longer with us.
LEADMALE:He was so full of life.
LEADFEMALE:I remember one time when I asked him to change a hundred-watt b ulb.
LEADMALE:He ran to the corner and brought back two 25s and a 50.
SUPFEMALE:He used to spend hours trying to teach a tub of margarine how to say ''butter.
SUPFEMALE:'' He was the o nly guy I knew who wo uld really give you a penny for your thoughts.
OTHERMALE:Oh, he was so speci al.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Mind, I'm still  alive.
OTHERMALE:I'm  alive, I'm right here.
LEADMALE:Are you, Mork? Peo ple who are  alive don't shut thems elves off from the wo rld.
LEADFEMALE:You're not protecting yours elf from harm, you're  closing yours elf off from everything that makes life worth living.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna miss you, Mork.
LEADMALE:Goodbye.
LEADMALE:Mind? Oh, I  already miss you.
LEADMALE:I don't wanna give up on life.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I wanna live again.
LEADFEMALE:What are we waiting for? I wanna go on that trip to Yellowstone.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, yes.
SUPMALE:Don't forget to bring your racket.
LEADFEMALE:We'll have something to do.
SUPFEMALE:Now, that's the Mork I know and vagu ely understand.
SUPFEMALE:My boy.
SUPMALE:Oh, Bick, I'm sorry about the  clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's okay.
LEADFEMALE:They weren't for me.
LEADFEMALE:I was gonna cut them down for my dog.
SUPMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPFEMALE:Goodbye, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Good to have you back.
LEADFEMALE:You two keep it quiet up here.
OTHERFEMALE:See? Oh, nice.
SUPMALE:That fe els better than any security in the wh ole wo rld.
OTHERMALE:I just want you to remember one thing, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:No matter how weird life gets, you just gotta keep on living.
LEADFEMALE:- I mean, look at your  alternative.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:This  place is a nice  place to visit, but I wouldn't wanna live here without you.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mind, no kissing.
SUPFEMALE:Say no-no to Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Mono.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you're right, Mind, what the heck? Come on, now.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Five, six, seven, eight.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in, oh, Butterball in the Sky.
LEADMALE:Mork, what are you two doing? Oh, we're c elebrating life, sir.
LEADFEMALE:You might say we're tripping the life fantastic.
LEADFEMALE:l didn't think life on Earth was all that pleasant, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Well, sir, it's got its share of dangers, but many of them are  blown out of proportion, not u nlike you.
LEADMALE:- Just get to the point.
LEADMALE:- Yes, sir.
LEADMALE:The point is that Eart hlings can prove any point they want using statistics.
SUPFEMALE:You see, many newspapers t alk about how many peo ple have died, but they never say how many peo ple have lived.
LEADFEMALE:I can even prove that you are not fat using the right statistics.
LEADFEMALE:l am not fat.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, sir.
SUPFEMALE:You're so large you have your own  climate.
LEADFEMALE:- l'll ignore that, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Yes, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Now, are you telling me that people should be totally oblivious to the dangers surrounding them? No, but if that's all they're looking for, that's all they're gonna see.
OTHERFEMALE:Unfortunat ely, most Eart hlings spend their whole life, well, worrying about, well, their whole life.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never forget the lesson I learned this week from my Eart hling friends.
LEADMALE:They taught me that the greatest gift is the gift of life and the greatest sin is to return it unopened.
LEADMALE:Unt il next week, sir.
SUPFEMALE:I've got a lot of unwrapping to do.
SUPMALE:You were great last night, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:That benefit concert was really terrific.
SUPMALE:Yeah, and the reviews aren't too bad either.
LEADFEMALE:Here, look.
LEADMALE:There's even a picture of me conducting the orchestra.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's a wonderful likeness of the back of your head.
LEADMALE:Boy, you certainly are in a jolly mood.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, why not? One critic called me the Bald Bernstein of Boulder.
LEADFEMALE:On top of that, we raised over $30,000 for the new Boulder Children's Hospital.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I wish I was doing that well.
LEADMALE:I promised to raise a thousand dollars, but looking for this new job has just taken up all my time.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, you can always rent Mork out to a research laboratory.
LEADMALE:I'm really gonna have to buckle down this next couple of days to raise the money I pledged.
SUPMALE:Maybe I'll dress up as a Girl Scout and go door to door.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it worked when I was 1 2.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing? I think I was sleep-jogging and I locked myself out.
SUPMALE:- How did you do that? - I don't know, I guess kind of like this: Ready, set, dream.
LEADMALE:Idiot delight.
LEADMALE:- Door-ja vu.
OTHERMALE:- Door-ja vu.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, it's Boulder Pops.
LEADMALE:Oh, what a wonderful evening.
SUPMALE:That was incredible.
SUPMALE:I mean, Beverly Sills and everything.
LEADFEMALE:Couldn't you tell it was me in the back going, ''Whoa, get down, mama''? Well, you know, sometimes I can really be irrepressible.
SUPMALE:I don't know why.
LEADMALE:Oh, look, it guessed my weight.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I really should be going.
SUPFEMALE:I've gotta show my picture to the rest of Boulder.
LEADFEMALE:And I'll keep making phone calls for donations.
SUPMALE:I haven't even raised enough money to pay my phone bill.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't worry, honey, you'll raise the money somehow.
LEADMALE:Well, I hope so.
LEADFEMALE:I'll have to disguise the back of my head so I can slip by the groupies.
SUPFEMALE:- Mind, Mind, Mind.
LEADMALE:- Oh, what? Why didn't you tell me that you needed money? You can have anything I own, except for my lips because those are rented.
LEADMALE:That's sweet, but the money's not for me.
OTHERFEMALE:It's for the new children's hospital.
LEADMALE:Mind, you mean, you can get money just by asking for it? Some people donate money to others if they think the cause is worthy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, like ABSCAM.
LEADFEMALE:Senator, do you really believe that you took this as a loan? No, I just thought it was a Christmas gift.
LEADFEMALE:No, not quite.
OTHERFEMALE:See, it's called charity.
OTHERMALE:People raise money in different ways, and then they donate it to people who they feel are in need.
LEADMALE:Remember the telethon we saw the other night? That was wonderful, especially when Monty Hall sang: Bess, you is my woman now Yes.
LEADMALE:Well, people were donating money to that charity.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never understand you Earthlings.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes the lights are on and nobody's home, you know what I'm saying? You've got one wheel in the sand.
SUPFEMALE:We Orkans ask for money, boy, oh, we're-- Right away, right in the institution in a little rubber room going: I'm okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, caring people here like to help others.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, I care and I wanna help.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, I wish you could, Mork.
LEADMALE:I've gotta have those donations in by Friday.
LEADFEMALE:As a matter of fact, I've gotta start making phone calls.
OTHERFEMALE:It shouldn't take that long because you won't have to raise that much money.
LEADMALE:You're building a children's hospital.
LEADFEMALE:It only has to be about this high.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome to Morkathon for Mindy's kids.
LEADMALE:Come on, now.
SUPMALE:I'll stay on here until you give, give, give.
LEADFEMALE:Come on now, little Tommy.
LEADFEMALE:Why am I here? What are you doing to me? No, let's go, let's go now, here we go.
SUPFEMALE:I'd like to bring you my first guest right now.
SUPFEMALE:But first: Hi, hi, hi.
LEADMALE:Don't be afraid of me.
LEADMALE:You know, look, these kids-- Can I say one thing? Here's my first guest.
SUPMALE:Let's bring out a wonderful group.
LEADFEMALE:But first, I'm gonna say, how much have we raised? Diddly.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, let's keep going.
SUPFEMALE:Let's bring on another wonderful act.
LEADFEMALE:The famous Bibbleenees.
SUPMALE:Thank you, thank you, it's so nice to be here.
LEADFEMALE:I want now to do the famous midget juggling.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you very much.
OTHERMALE:And now, please-- No, please, don't, no.
OTHERMALE:Let go.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey, no.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, no.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:What? No, don't touch me there.
LEADMALE:Don't grab me in Hey, my arms.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, thank-- We'll be having a telethon for them in just about an hour, so don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:Let's keep going right now.
SUPMALE:I wanna thank all of you, but first-- A little heart and soul here.
LEADMALE:Let's bring them out right now.
LEADFEMALE:These kids, bring them out.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
LEADFEMALE:We are the Confusions.
LEADFEMALE:We can dance better than we can sing.
SUPFEMALE:I'd like to introduce the band.
OTHERFEMALE:First of all, Larry, proud Aquarius.
LEADMALE:Tom, moon in Encino, I don't know why.
OTHERFEMALE:Billy Bob, I don't know what the hell.
SUPMALE:My agent got me this job.
OTHERMALE:That's it, I'd like to thank all these young people here.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADMALE:We'll be coming around now.
SUPFEMALE:We'll collect money.
SUPFEMALE:- Thank you.
SUPMALE:- How about that, huh? Isn't he terrific, ladies and gentlemen? Mork, what are you doing? I'm doing a telethon to raise money for Mindy's kids.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's real nice.
OTHERMALE:You're scaring away my customers.
SUPMALE:If you keep this up, Mindy's gonna be raising money for me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry about that.
LEADMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:I'll turn in my tie.
OTHERFEMALE:I Excuse me, sir, do you mind if I mope here or is this a no-moping section? No, kid, sure, sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you know something? You got a great approach there, kid.
LEADFEMALE:But you sure got a lot to learn about fundraising.
SUPFEMALE:You know how to raise money? Oh, I'm a professional from back East.
SUPMALE:I raise money every day of my life.
LEADFEMALE:You do? How? - Give me a quarter and I'll show you.
SUPMALE:- Oh, sure.
OTHERMALE:See? I just raised a quarter.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you're slicker than a Teflon banana peel.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy, I didn't even know I was had.
OTHERFEMALE:It was already in my ear.
LEADFEMALE:That was: How do you get a job like that? I admire your thirst for knowledge, kid.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you what, in exchange for a percentage of everything you rake in, I teach you everything I know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really? Oh, that's a great deal, lucille.
LEADFEMALE:No, the name's Godfrey.
OTHERMALE:- What's yours? - Oh, hey, hey, hey.
SUPMALE:I wasn't born yesterday off some turnip truck.
LEADMALE:If you wanna know my name, it's gonna cost a quarter.
LEADFEMALE:All right, my name's Mork and here's your quarter.
LEADMALE:Boy, I'm hotter than a whip, aren't I? The Aspen, Grand Junction and Salt Lake City bus is now loading.
LEADFEMALE:That's the Aspen, Grand Junction and Salt Lake City bus.
SUPFEMALE:Last call for Aspen, Grand Junction and Salt Lake City.
OTHERFEMALE:This is one of my favourite spots.
LEADMALE:Lots of people coming through.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, the first thing we do, we check petty cash.
LEADMALE:Nothing in those.
LEADMALE:Nothing in mine either.
SUPFEMALE:Atten-hut.
LEADFEMALE:Assume the fundraising position.
LEADFEMALE:Perfect.
OTHERFEMALE:- Now, show me what you learned.
LEADMALE:- Oh, gotcha, watch this.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, Hare Krishna, hare lama.
SUPFEMALE:My name is Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- I'm trying to raise money for-- - Who cares? Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Was it something I said? No, it's a rat race out there, kid.
OTHERFEMALE:You wanna raise funds, you gotta give a performance.
LEADMALE:Here, watch a master at work, okay? Excuse me, ma'am.
SUPFEMALE:Could you please spare just a few pennies for a poor destitute soul who is trying to stave off the bitter bite of winter? It is not for myself, you understand, but for my son who is lying-- Oh, bless you, bless you, bless you.
SUPMALE:Godfrey? Godfrey, I didn't know it was that bad.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:Take this, it's all I have.
SUPMALE:It's a picture of Robert Conrad.
SUPFEMALE:It's a picture-- He was real young and he didn't have a battery on his shoulder.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thank you very much, son.
OTHERMALE:I was just acting.
LEADMALE:Oh, wow, De Niro, Moore.
LEADMALE:Raging Bum.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, I tell you, maybe it's better for you to use the flattery approach, you know, butter them up.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, sounds kinky, but I'll give it a try.
LEADMALE:Hello, baby, how are you? My name is Mork Jourdan.
OTHERFEMALE:I would like to design your jeans.
LEADMALE:Someone sprayed those on you, but you look beautiful.
OTHERMALE:You know, you are a very, very beautiful woman.
OTHERMALE:All I can say is that you must be so sweet.
LEADMALE:So, so sweet that I would bake a cake in your name, you know what I'm saying? How are you? Very nice to have met you.
SUPFEMALE:Bless you, madam, bless you.
LEADFEMALE:- What did you get? - Oh, her phone number.
LEADMALE:I'll take that.
LEADFEMALE:I guess the best thing for you, kid, is just to kind of be yourself, you know, say nothing, just look pathetic.
OTHERMALE:Okay, okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Perfect.
SUPFEMALE:Perfect.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter, brother? You down on your luck? Hey, could you use a little something to tide you over? Here, don't be ashamed.
OTHERMALE:No nukes.
LEADMALE:What did you get? How did you do? Kid, you were just great.
LEADFEMALE:You got what it takes.
LEADMALE:And I'll take what you got.
LEADFEMALE:That's for tuition.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, does that enrol me in the school of hard knocks now? Hey, you bet.
LEADFEMALE:This is just the beginning too, remember.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, boy, is Mindy gonna be proud of me, huh? Oh, I'm gonna build that hospital right from the bottom up.
LEADMALE:I hope asking for donations through the mail works a lot better for me than it did for John Anderson.
LEADMALE:Who? See what I mean? Glenda, would you like to switch again or what? No, thanks, I'm fine.
LEADMALE:You know, maybe this would be easier if I use a sponge.
LEADMALE:Oh, sorry, Mork took all our sponges down to the river and set them free.
SUPMALE:He's really got sort of an offbeat sense of compassion, doesn't he? Now, don't you worry, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:You've been putting so much into this fund drive, it's bound to be a success.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, I'd like to make a little contribution to the hospital.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks, Glenda.
SUPMALE:I've been meaning to give this to you.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's really thoughtful.
OTHERMALE:But didn't you put a few too many zeros in this number? No, no, no, it's a very worthy cause.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, I'd only blow the money on T-bills.
LEADFEMALE:Glenda, I don't mean to sound forward or anything, but would you adopt me? - Isn't she adorable? - Oh, she sure is.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Jeanie, we've gotta run.
LEADMALE:It's almost time for racquetball.
LEADMALE:Do you think I'm gonna like this as much as I did bowling? Oh, it doesn't matter.
LEADFEMALE:The clothes are a lot cuter.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, you guys, thanks a lot for your help.
LEADMALE:- Good luck, see you later.
LEADFEMALE:- Bye, okay.
SUPMALE:Well, back to work.
LEADFEMALE:No rest for the perky.
LEADMALE:Eureka, Mind.
SUPMALE:Mind, what's wrong? I just swallowed a stamp.
OTHERMALE:Well, quick, swallow a letter.
LEADFEMALE:Where did you get those clothes? Bowery Brothers.
SUPFEMALE:It's a little boutique on Skid Drive.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, boy, you're gonna be so happy.
LEADFEMALE:Not only are we gonna build a wing, we're gonna build a wing and a thigh.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, what Earth concept have you misunderstood this week? No, I didn't misunderstand.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll be proud of me.
SUPFEMALE:I've mastered fundraising.
LEADMALE:Watch this, watch this.
OTHERMALE:Give me a dollar.
LEADFEMALE:You mean, you bummed all this money? Oh, not bummed, Mind, no, it's an art form.
SUPMALE:I would've brought home more except there are holes in my pocket and I had to help some friends out, get them a little libation.
LEADMALE:But that's panhandling.
SUPMALE:No, Mind, panhandling is what nurses do in the hospital.
LEADMALE:I'm an individualised self-help fundraiser.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'm getting a headache real soon.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, you want me to bum you an aspirin? Give me an aspirin.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, begging isn't the right way to collect money.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, but my friend, Godfrey, said-- Oh, Mork, look at you.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't-- lt's just-- It's so humili-- It's so embarrassing.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, now I really have a headache.
LEADFEMALE:I guess that means you won't be able to have dinner at the mission.
LEADMALE:That's too bad because I already selected a wonderful wine.
LEADMALE:Look, here.
LEADFEMALE:It says: ''Mount Thunder Wazola.
OTHERMALE:'' Oh, come on, Mind, come on.
LEADMALE:I like you.
LEADFEMALE:You're pretty.
OTHERMALE:- Mind? - Not yet, Mork.
LEADMALE:Okay, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, now I'm ready.
OTHERMALE:- Mork? - Present.
SUPMALE:Now, I realise I realise that you are a creature from outer space.
SUPFEMALE:- ''Creature'' is a little rough, isn't it? - Not at the moment.
OTHERMALE:Why do I feel like I'm sitting next to Mount St.
LEADMALE:Mindy's? Now, I realise that you are a creature from outer space, but there are certain things that even the Blob wouldn't do.
OTHERFEMALE:I just wanted to raise money for your hospital.
LEADFEMALE:I know, Mork, but begging in the bus station where all my friends could see you? It wasn't all your friends, Mind.
LEADMALE:It was just six of them.
SUPMALE:Besides, they were only good for $20.
LEADFEMALE:You panhandled from my friends? Oh, I'm gonna crawl under a rock.
SUPMALE:You did the same thing.
LEADFEMALE:I was just a little bit more creative.
SUPFEMALE:- What's the difference? - There's a big difference, Mork.
OTHERMALE:In the first place, I wasn't asking for myself.
LEADMALE:I was asking for other people.
SUPFEMALE:Well, so was I.
LEADFEMALE:People at the bus station didn't know that.
SUPMALE:Panhandlers usually keep the money for themselves.
LEADMALE:My friend, Godfrey, my mentor said, ''We have to take the direct approach.
LEADMALE:We're gonna build a new society where you don't have a middleman.
LEADMALE:'' Your friend and mentor is a bum.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, shattered illusion.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:No more, Mindy, no more.
LEADMALE:You've hurt me to the quick.
LEADMALE:What I meant was what your friend does is called begging.
LEADFEMALE:And on Earth, begging isn't exactly in.
LEADMALE:And only derelicts beg.
SUPMALE:I thought everybody on Earth begged.
OTHERMALE:I mean, in court you beg for mercy.
SUPMALE:Politicians beg the issue, people beg off.
LEADMALE:I mean, you even teach your dog to beg, Mind.
SUPMALE:- Oh, Mork, it's not the same thing.
SUPFEMALE:- Beg your pardon? I appreciate what you're trying to do, but begging just isn't right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I didn't mean to embarrass you.
LEADFEMALE:Just don't do any more panhandling, okay? - Okay.
SUPFEMALE:- Good.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, now I gotta get these in the mail.
SUPFEMALE:Look, while I'm gone, I think maybe you should glance over your Earth manual again.
OTHERFEMALE:Only this time, try reading it, don't just colour the pictures.
LEADMALE:Step right up, everybody, we're giving away free money here.
LEADFEMALE:Let me give you a dollar.
LEADFEMALE:Please, now, come on, free money.
SUPFEMALE:Pardon me, have a fistful of dollars.
SUPFEMALE:Sink right in there.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry about that.
SUPFEMALE:I can't even give this stuff away.
SUPMALE:Oh, where's a mugger when you really need him? Excuse me, sir, do you have any spare change? - No, I don't.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, now you do.
SUPMALE:- Come here, there you go.
SUPMALE:- Thanks.
OTHERMALE:Oh, gee, thanks, mister.
SUPMALE:Hey, you're a saint.
LEADMALE:- Hey, bless you.
SUPFEMALE:- This fruitcake is giving away money.
LEADMALE:Hold it, hold it, hold it.
SUPMALE:Hey, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Don't you dare.
LEADMALE:You leave that.
LEADMALE:What's going on here? Well, I was just giving the money back.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't it beautiful? Are you bonkers? You're supposed to take handouts, not give them away.
SUPFEMALE:I know, but I heard it's better to give than to receive.
SUPFEMALE:You should try it yourself, Godfrey.
OTHERFEMALE:Never.
SUPFEMALE:I can't understand it.
LEADFEMALE:I did everything I could for you.
LEADFEMALE:I treated you like you were my own flesh and blood.
SUPMALE:I kicked you out of the house, I threw you in the gutter and I made a bum out of you.
LEADMALE:Where did I go wrong? Godfrey, it's only money.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's like an Arab saying, ''It's only oil.
SUPMALE:'' Money's the most important thing in the world.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you understand? It's much too valuable to give away.
LEADMALE:Oh, if I had known you felt like that, I mean, whoa.
SUPFEMALE:Well, here, Godfrey, this is all I've got left.
SUPMALE:It's a McGovern-Eagleton button.
LEADFEMALE:Kid, I'm real disappointed in you.
LEADMALE:Godfrey.
LEADMALE:It's people like you that give bums a bad name.
LEADMALE:You gave the money back? You said I got the money in a way that wasn't socially acceptable to middle-class mores.
SUPFEMALE:- I said that? - Well, not as eloquently.
OTHERMALE:What I meant was it's wrong to beg for money unless it's for a worthy cause.
LEADFEMALE:Then it's not begging, it's charity.
LEADMALE:First I get the money wrong, then I give it back wrong.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, this place is really perplexing.
LEADMALE:I mean, no wonder psychiatrists drive Mercedes.
LEADMALE:Who can stay mad at puppies or Orkans? Godfrey, come on in.
SUPMALE:- Hi, kid.
LEADFEMALE:- Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, this is my financial advisor, Godfrey.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I've heard a lot about you, Godfrey.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Come on in, make yourself at home.
LEADFEMALE:I'll put some newspapers on the couch.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, don't bother.
SUPMALE:This ain't gonna take but a minute.
SUPFEMALE:You know, kid, earlier today, I was sure you was the biggest sucker I had ever met in my whole life.
LEADMALE:Oh, shucks.
LEADFEMALE:But, you know, after you left that bus station, I got to thinking, and I saw this little girl standing there crying because she was lost.
OTHERMALE:Suddenly it hit me, you know, money, money don't mean nothing if I can change that little girl's life.
OTHERMALE:Right then and there, I decided to make the big sacrifice.
LEADMALE:What did you do? I gave her a dime so she could call her mother.
SUPFEMALE:And I tell you, the look on that girl's face made me feel so good.
LEADMALE:I started thinking how good I would feel if I could help a lot of kids, you know? So Here, that's for your hospital.
OTHERMALE:- You're making a donation? - Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:You're welcome.
SUPMALE:Godfrey, you have to let it go now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this is very generous of you, Godfrey.
SUPMALE:Now I can almost make my pledge.
LEADMALE:Almost? What do you mean, you're still short? Only $40.
SUPMALE:Oh, boy, this is gonna be painful.
LEADMALE:This is wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, you born-again bum.
SUPMALE:Come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Just don't spread that around, will you? I've worked too hard to get where I am.
LEADMALE:- Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:- I'll be seeing you.
LEADMALE:- Oh, can I walk you to the gutter? - No.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Have you ever thought of maybe taking on a little responsibility? You know, getting a job and kind of settling down? Getting married.
SUPMALE:Raising kids, send them through college.
LEADMALE:I did all that.
SUPFEMALE:That's how I got to be a bum.
OTHERMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in, my favourite superior being.
LEADMALE:- Let's hear your report, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Yes, sir.
LEADMALE:And in the centre ring, it's the incredible, shrinking dollar.
LEADFEMALE:You can spend it, you can save it, you can waste it, but you can't take it with you.
LEADMALE:No, sirree, bobcat tail.
OTHERMALE:You've already made a report on money and how Earthlings love to hoard it, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes, sir.
LEADMALE:This week, I learned about a very generous act called charity.
SUPFEMALE:There's another side to the coin.
SUPMALE:How about that for a nifty metaphor, Beeb? Little Beebs, little shilly.
SUPMALE:- Get to the point, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Yes, sir.
SUPFEMALE:See, sir, charity is a concept whereby Earthlings with money help those without it.
OTHERMALE:It's a return investment where you take a loss, but you reap a higher dividend.
LEADMALE:l thought you told me that a fool and his money were soon parted.
LEADMALE:Well, that's one saying, sir, but the other one is: ''It's better to give than to receive.
LEADFEMALE:'' That's why there's a Thanksgiving Day and not a Thanksgetting Day, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Most of all, sir, I learned that the buck starts right here.
LEADFEMALE:Until next week, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, now, don't worry, honey.
LEADFEMALE:You'll get a job soon.
LEADMALE:I hope so.
SUPMALE:Well, Mindy, you know, if it wasn't for something my father told me, I never would have gotten my first job.
LEADFEMALE:- What did he say? - Get out of the house, you bum.
LEADFEMALE:And if you're real good, I'll take you to see Popeye again.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder how I got those big arms.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, Mind.
LEADMALE:Mind.
SUPMALE:- Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, kids.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I have wonderful news for you, Mind.
LEADMALE:Bon appetit, Stephanie.
SUPMALE:They're the munchkins.
LEADMALE:I told them you were looking for a job, because you were tired of seeing me fretting going: Will she get the job or will she end up as the Bag Lady of Boulder, fighting alley cats for fish heads? Lola, tell her the good news.
OTHERMALE:Lay it on her.
OTHERFEMALE:My uncle manages KTNS, the TV station.
OTHERFEMALE:And I think there's a job available in the newsroom.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, anyway, Lola, but I've already been over to KTNS two or three times, and there's nothing available.
OTHERFEMALE:You're spinning your wheels.
SUPMALE:Get a job at the House of Pies.
LEADFEMALE:I eat there a lot.
SUPMALE:Stephanie eats everywhere a lot.
LEADFEMALE:Lola's uncle said there'd be a job opening today, Mind.
LEADMALE:Really? Well, maybe I do stand a chance.
OTHERMALE:I don't see why not.
LEADFEMALE:You're attractive to men, yet no threat to women.
LEADFEMALE:You know, when she talks, E.F. Hutton listens.
OTHERMALE:Here's my uncle's card.
LEADFEMALE:And, oh, by the way, take one of mine.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Stephanie.
LEADFEMALE:I've gotta get home.
LEADFEMALE:Carl Sagan's on Cavett.
OTHERFEMALE:You might have a better chance of getting a job if you weren't so skinny.
LEADFEMALE:Are you gonna call the station? Well, you bet.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy, isn't it wonderful, Pops? I mean, today, little Mindy McConnell for the local TV station.
OTHERFEMALE:Tomorrow, Fred Silverwoman.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, Mind.
LEADMALE:- Hello, KTNS? Yes, I understand you have a job opening.
LEADMALE:Oh, my name is Mindy McConnell, and I'd be very interested in coming down for an interview.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah, I can do that.
OTHERMALE:Oh, sure, I can do that.
LEADMALE:Well, I can try to do that.
SUPMALE:Okay, fine, tomorrow at 4.
OTHERFEMALE:Very good.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:What did he say, Mind? All I could hear was: Well, they said every now and then, I'd have to be on camera.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I've never been on camera before.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I saw those home movies when you were 2.
LEADFEMALE:You're a natural.
LEADFEMALE:Remember this one? Thank you, miss, but we're looking for someone with more experience.
LEADMALE:Boy, this weather.
LEADMALE:I just about missed my chance.
SUPFEMALE:- My interview's at 4:00.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, mine's at 4:20.
LEADMALE:I'm early.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:- You know, you look-- No.
LEADFEMALE:- You know, you look-- No.
LEADMALE:- It sure is crowded in here, huh? - It sure is.
LEADFEMALE:My name's Mindy McConnell.
LEADMALE:Mine's Mandy McDonald.
LEADFEMALE:- What a coincidence.
LEADFEMALE:- Isn't it, though? - I bet you're a journalism major too.
SUPFEMALE:- Yeah, how'd you know? Most of these girls here are.
LEADMALE:Do you all travel as a group? No, I bump into a lot of them at these interviews.
LEADMALE:You know, there are only so many jobs.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you're telling me.
LEADFEMALE:It isn't as rosy as they lead you to believe in college.
SUPFEMALE:Colorado State? Almost.
LEADMALE:University of Colorado.
LEADMALE:I graduated with honours.
LEADMALE:Me too.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:You don't happen to live with a guy named Mork, do you? Not anymore.
OTHERMALE:You know a Mork? Oh, I thought you said Mark.
SUPMALE:That's my old boyfriend.
LEADFEMALE:Mark and Mandy.
SUPMALE:Cute.
LEADMALE:You know, it's amazing.
LEADMALE:You think you're so special when you graduate, then you get out in the world, and you find you're just another perky face.
SUPMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADMALE:Next, McConnell, Mindy.
SUPMALE:I'm McConnell-- Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, Mindy McConnell.
LEADMALE:Miles Sternhagen.
OTHERMALE:I'm station manager of KTNS.
LEADFEMALE:It's nice weather, isn't it? No, it's snowing.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Miss McConnell, what are your qualifications? Oh, my qualifications.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I graduated with honours from the University of Colorado, and I served three years on the school newspaper, and I was associate editor of the yearbook.
LEADMALE:Miss McConnell, have you ever had any experience in the field? No, but I really feel that-- Well, thank you very much, but I'm looking for someone who has.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Sternhagen, but there's something I'd like to say.
SUPFEMALE:Yes? I know you've probably met a lot of people like me.
LEADMALE:Well, I'd like you to know that I've certainly met a lot of people like you too.
SUPMALE:You all claim that you wanna hire someone with experience, and yet you'll never give any of us the chance to get any.
OTHERMALE:I mean, you probably wouldn't send a man to the moon, because he hadn't been there before.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I may not be experienced, but I'm intelligent, and capable, and hard-working, and I do a darn good job.
SUPFEMALE:No, I do a damn good job.
SUPMALE:Miss McConnell, you believe in speaking your mind.
SUPFEMALE:- Yes.
OTHERMALE:- That's why I fired the last girl.
OTHERMALE:Maybe I ought to take a chance on you if you're willing to work for 200 a week.
LEADMALE:- I'd do it for half that.
SUPMALE:- Oh, no, that wouldn't be fair.
SUPMALE:Let's make it 1 1 0.
SUPMALE:I can't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:You mean, you're hiring me? - I don't even know what the job is.
OTHERMALE:- Well, it's not all that thrilling.
SUPMALE:This is a small station.
LEADMALE:Not like when I was at the network.
LEADMALE:Then, when I turned down Cronkite and Rather, well, it mattered.
LEADMALE:That's why I'm here in Denver's appendix.
SUPMALE:But then, that's old business.
OTHERFEMALE:As far as the job goes, Miss McConnell, you'll do any number of trivial odds and ends, and fill in on camera for whoever's not here.
LEADMALE:Well, don't you wanna audition me or anything? You seem to have a lot of faith in yourself.
SUPFEMALE:We'll try you out on the air.
LEADFEMALE:Tonight on the late news, you'll do the weather report.
LEADFEMALE:Dewey Fishbeck is out with the croup.
LEADMALE:Gee, tonight.
LEADFEMALE:That just seems so soon.
SUPMALE:I mean, I've never really done too much of that kind of thing.
LEADMALE:Well, that's all right.
LEADMALE:If you're no good, I'll fire you.
OTHERFEMALE:Power is dizzying.
LEADFEMALE:Well I promise you you won't be sorry, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Stainhergen.
SUPFEMALE:That's Sternhagen, and I'm already sorry.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't Mork wanna celebrate with us? Oh, Mork doesn't drink champagne.
SUPFEMALE:He feels it just perpetuates cruelty to grapes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he's such a little snuggle puss.
SUPFEMALE:I wish I could buy one somewhere.
LEADMALE:- I just love your choice of champagne.
LEADMALE:- Oh, me too.
LEADFEMALE:It's much better than the champagne Remo gets for the restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:That stuff comes in cans.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'd better be going before the snow gets worse.
LEADFEMALE:Now, Cathy and I'll be watching you tonight, honey, and I just can't wait to see how you're gonna slip, ''Hi, Dad'' into a weather report.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that man is such a social lubricant.
SUPMALE:So tell me, Mindy, what are you gonna wear on the air tonight? Wear? Oh, I don't know, just my regular Mindy clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Jeanie, dear, it doesn't matter what she wears.
LEADMALE:It's what she projects.
LEADMALE:Now, Mindy, you're going to be on at 1 0:00 at night, right? Well, if I were you, I'd cater to the mood of the Iate-night adult audience.
LEADMALE:- How? - Well Hello, Boulder.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome to the Joy of Weather by M.
SUPFEMALE:We'll get to the weather later, but first, I dance for you.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't talk like that on my honeymoon.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, I think maybe you should just be yourself, you know, like: ''Hi, I'm Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't the weather great? There's a real cute blizzard out there, and don't you just wanna write a thank-you note to Jack Frost?'' You know, something like that, maybe.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Oh, would you look at that snow? Oh, we'd better go, Jeanie.
SUPMALE:Oh, I am so glad I bought those Gucci snow tires.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thanks for coming over, you guys.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, they don't really make Gucci snow tires, do they? I hope not.
LEADFEMALE:- Bye-bye, good luck.
SUPMALE:- Bye.
SUPFEMALE:- Thanks.
OTHERMALE:- We'll be watching you.
OTHERMALE:Hello, Boulder.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome to the Joy of Weather by Oh, God.
LEADMALE:Are you Mindy McConnell? Yes, I am.
LEADMALE:And this is my friend, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Hello.
LEADMALE:- I'm Jake Loomis, the cameraman.
OTHERMALE:I'm surprised you got through.
LEADMALE:Nobody else did.
SUPMALE:The whole town's snowed in.
LEADMALE:Well, I have a four-wheel-drive Jeep.
LEADMALE:What do you mean, nobody's here? Just me and the engineer.
SUPFEMALE:Yep, I've been here all night.
SUPMALE:Show business is my life.
LEADMALE:- Who's--? Who's gonna do the news? - Search me.
SUPFEMALE:Hold on, Mind.
LEADMALE:Hold on a second.
OTHERFEMALE:He's clean, Mind.
SUPMALE:I thought all the flakes were outside.
LEADFEMALE:Whoever showed up is supposed to call Sternhagen here at this number right away.
SUPFEMALE:The phone is behind the desk there.
OTHERFEMALE:Better hurry up.
OTHERFEMALE:The movie's almost over.
LEADMALE:Oh, look, it's my favourite, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Benji Shaves His Legs.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Sternhagen? Yes, this is Mindy McConnell.
LEADMALE:Oh, I guess I'm the only one that made it through the snow.
LEADMALE:Well So I guess we're not doing the news tonight? Oh, no, no, I don't think-- No, no, no, I couldn't possibly-- I see.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I'll try.
LEADMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:You handled that well, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Mork, he said that there's a half an hour until the station signs off.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't wanna lose his sponsors, and he said he wants me to fill the whole half hour all by myself.
SUPMALE:- What am I gonna do? - I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I have to-- You're on in 1 5 seconds.
LEADFEMALE:Here's the news and weather.
LEADMALE:There's the camera.
LEADFEMALE:Don't blow it.
LEADFEMALE:- Thanks, no pressure.
OTHERFEMALE:- Will you hold this for a second? - Five, four, three - We've got news.
OTHERFEMALE:We've got-- - Mork, give me those quickly.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, here, Mind, catch.
SUPMALE:You're on.
SUPMALE:Good evening.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm Mindy McConnell.
LEADMALE:And tonight, I'll be bringing you the news from all over.
LEADMALE:A news report has just been handed to me.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:''Expected to be over by December.
OTHERFEMALE:'' And that's the news for tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Another news bulletin has just been handed to me.
LEADMALE:''Thousands flee in terror as'' ''The pope blesses visitors to the Vatican.
LEADFEMALE:'' And that's the news.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, help me.
LEADFEMALE:- What'd you say, Mind? - Help me.
OTHERMALE:Mork the Video Junkie to the rescue.
LEADMALE:Hello, good evening.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you very much, Mindy McConnell.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Thanks for dropping in tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, hello.
LEADMALE:We have the news from Boulder, Colorado, as we like to call it, the Mindy City.
LEADFEMALE:And now for the news with Walter Morkite.
LEADMALE:Hello, I'm Walter Morkite with Dan Mork in London, Morkey Rather in Paris, and Michael Mork in women's clothes.
LEADFEMALE:News flash from New York today.
OTHERFEMALE:Chase Manhattan Bank was robbed.
OTHERMALE:Here's a description as follows: ''Four stories high, lots of bricks and plenty of glass.
LEADMALE:'' Moving right along to Washington, D.C.
LEADMALE:''Today, President Ronald Reagan replied to a group of hecklers by saying: 'What would this country be without this great land of ours?' He also stunned America in his acceptance of the presidency by going: 'My fellow Americans-- Line.
SUPFEMALE:''' Moving right along, we go to Moscow.
SUPMALE:But first we have-- Yes, we have the update.
LEADMALE:We're gonna have the update from San Salvador.
SUPMALE:There's some physical unrest up there, a little violence.
LEADMALE:We have the actual footage of a riot taking place in San Salvador.
LEADFEMALE:Take it away.
LEADMALE:We don't have the footage, so this is what it would look like.
LEADFEMALE:Moving right along, also from Soviet Union.
LEADFEMALE:''Shot-putter Olga Svets finally agreed to talk to the press and deny the allegations that she has been taking steroids all these years.
LEADMALE:She replied by merely saying: She also said that her 80-inch bust was merely hereditary.
SUPFEMALE:'' Thank you, Olga.
SUPFEMALE:And in the field of sports medicine, another incredible breakthrough.
LEADFEMALE:It's called the Joe Garagiola School of Childbirth.
LEADMALE:It happens in the operating room, and it consists of a man dressed in a catcher's mask and mitt going: Yo, baby.
SUPMALE:Right here, baby, yo.
SUPFEMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, you've got to believe in something or you'll fall for anything.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:I want to leave you.
OTHERFEMALE:Got to go now.
OTHERFEMALE:But I want you to know that you can fool some of the people some of the time, and the rest will watch.
LEADMALE:So now we have a brief spot announcement.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Spot.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
OTHERMALE:- We're off.
OTHERMALE:Ten-second commercial.
LEADMALE:- Oh, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, we're doing great.
LEADFEMALE:We only have a couple of minutes left.
LEADFEMALE:I've got the weather report together.
SUPFEMALE:You don't want me to help you with it? No, it's time I stood on my own two feet.
OTHERMALE:- It's now or never.
LEADMALE:- All right, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:- Good luck, Mind.
LEADMALE:- Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:We're back on.
LEADFEMALE:Good evening, everyone.
LEADFEMALE:And here's the weather report for Boulder and vicinity.
LEADMALE:''We have a blizzard.
LEADMALE:Heavy snow continuing tonight and on through the weekend.
LEADFEMALE:The present temperature is 1 9 degrees with an expected Iow tonight of 8.
SUPMALE:'' And that's it.
LEADMALE:Boy, it sure is cold out.
OTHERMALE:How cold is it? Well, it's so cold Well, it is the kind of weather where you'd kind of like to curl up with a nice cup of hot chocolate and a good book, and snuggle under a big warm quilt.
LEADMALE:You know, the kind your grandmother made.
SUPFEMALE:It sure is.
LEADMALE:It's hard to drive in the snow, but it's a good time to go walk and visit your neighbours.
OTHERMALE:You know, maybe wave and say hello.
LEADMALE:Sure, winter is harsh, but what other time of year? What other time of year can you celebrate Christmas, and look forward to spring? That's it? Well, that's it, ladies and gentlemen.
LEADMALE:I'm Mindy McConnell, and we'll be seeing you again.
OTHERMALE:Real soon.
LEADMALE:Hopefully.
SUPMALE:That's it.
OTHERFEMALE:We're off the air.
OTHERFEMALE:Good job.
LEADMALE:- It was, wasn't it? - Don't let it go to your head.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Mind, you did it.
LEADMALE:- I did all right.
SUPMALE:I stood in front of all those people, and I talked and it felt great.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- We did it.
SUPMALE:- No.
LEADMALE:- We actually filled the time.
LEADMALE:No, you did it.
SUPMALE:I was just the tail on the kite.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERMALE:Can you believe it? Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, it's Mr.
LEADMALE:Sternhagen.
LEADFEMALE:- Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Sternhagen.
SUPMALE:- How do you do, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Sternhagen? I'm Mork.
LEADMALE:Well, have it your own way.
SUPMALE:I got here as soon as I could.
LEADMALE:You'd be surprised how fast you can go with one foot on the floor and your chin on the horn.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds fun, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I thought that my career was over, because we had nothing to put on that tube.
SUPMALE:Tube.
LEADFEMALE:You may not believe this, but these are the kinds of crises that really used to get to me.
SUPFEMALE:But no mo-- No mo-- Not now.
LEADMALE:Did you enjoy Mindy's weather forecast? I never know what I enjoy until the ratings come in.
LEADFEMALE:I learned that a long time ago when I was high.
LEADMALE:In the network.
LEADMALE:Well, do I get to keep the job? Why--? Why--? Why not? You've pulled me through a difficult time, and I just can't thank you enough, Miss McC-- Miss-- Miss McC Miss McC-- And you too, Mr.
LEADMALE:Nee-tee, Noo-tee Hi.
SUPFEMALE:I got here as soon as I could.
LEADMALE:Keep up the good work.
SUPFEMALE:That's the type of leader this country needs, Mind.
LEADMALE:Believe me, Mork, he wasn't like that when first I met him.
OTHERMALE:But who cares? He liked what I did.
SUPFEMALE:I get to keep the job.
OTHERMALE:I guess those four years of college really paid off.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Oh, but not as much as my three years of Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, shucks and wazoo.
LEADMALE:Boy, you know, I really hate to drive in this kind of snow.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:It could be kind of dangerous.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:We'll get a ride from Mr.
SUPMALE:Sternhagen.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go get him.
SUPMALE:Don't take the car.
SUPMALE:You'll kill yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Your Lardness.
LEADFEMALE:That's not funny, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- l have a thyroid problem.
SUPMALE:- Oh, yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:That and a truckload of mashed potatoes will do it every time.
SUPMALE:- Will you get on with it, Mork? - Oh, yes, sir.
SUPMALE:Sir, this week, I learned about the concept of jobs.
LEADMALE:After much searching and difficulty, Mindy finally got one.
SUPFEMALE:- But l thought she was a student.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, she's a very good one, sir.
OTHERMALE:But there's an old Earth saying: Those who stay in college too long die by degrees.
LEADMALE:Why all the mountaineering gear, Mork? Oh, Beebs says it's to make you feel at home, Your Matterhorniness.
LEADFEMALE:You don't buy that one either? Well, basically, sir, what it is is a metaphor to symbolize the climb that Mindy's just undertaken to reach the peak of success.
SUPFEMALE:- What does that mean in Orkan? - Well, sir, I'll give it to you straight.
LEADMALE:It means any Earthling who expects a job when he gets out of college is a victim of the abominable snow job.
LEADFEMALE:You know? Basically that there's no guarantee that any Earthling who graduates from college is gonna get a job unless he can play basketball, you know what I'm saying? That doesn't seem fair, Mork.
LEADMALE:It isn't, sir.
LEADFEMALE:It's like Tarzan said: ''It's a jungle out there, Jane.
OTHERFEMALE:'' You see, the old ones are forced out of their jobs, the young ones can't get in, and the ones in the middle, they all get ulcers from working too hard.
LEADFEMALE:But I've learned one thing, sir.
LEADMALE:No matter how high the mountain or how tall the task, you have to take that first step to reach the top.
OTHERMALE:Okay, kids, something new for today.
OTHERMALE:It's called Record Hour.
LEADFEMALE:Stuff Record Hour.
SUPFEMALE:I'd rather have lunch hour.
LEADMALE:No, Stephanie, you just had lunch, and somewhere, a small country's going hungry.
LEADFEMALE:What's Record Hour, Mork? Oh, well, Record Hour's-- Mindy gave us a record player so we can play records I've been wanting to play.
LEADFEMALE:All those wonderful stories.
OTHERFEMALE:Today we have a fairy tale documentary called War of the Worlds.
LEADFEMALE:It's told to us by the biggest Mother Goose of them all, Orson Welles.
SUPMALE:There we go.
SUPMALE:Watch this.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:Watch this.
SUPMALE:Spin.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, yeah.
SUPMALE:Manual.
SUPMALE:There we are.
LEADMALE:There we go.
LEADMALE:We bought it from Nixon's secretary.
LEADMALE:Hold on.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, there seems to be, as the Egyptians say, tut-tut, a problem.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, I killed it.
LEADFEMALE:I've committed stereocide.
LEADFEMALE:Stereocide, stereocide.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna go to Dolby hell for this.
LEADFEMALE:I guess Record Hour just bit the dust.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, it didn't.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:The show must go on, Jose, because if not, we'll lose our grant from The Chrysler Foundation.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:Wait, we'll start over from the beginning.
LEADFEMALE:All right, here we go.
SUPMALE:Once upon a time, a group of people decided to leave their home, and heads towards, heads towards, heads towards Heads towards Earth.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Jon.
OTHERMALE:That's the way the record does it at Mindy's house.
LEADFEMALE:It's a little touch of realism here.
LEADMALE:Mork, could you finish the story while we're still kids? Thank you, Lola.
LEADFEMALE:No pressure.
LEADFEMALE:Now, basically, the story ends like this.
SUPMALE:All these aliens landed in Hollywood.
LEADFEMALE:They were put on hold, and they died a horrible death.
LEADFEMALE:Well That's all for today.
SUPFEMALE:Time for playtime.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Fowler's waiting for you out in the yard.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't tie her up like you did yesterday.
SUPMALE:Someone tied a real good hitch knot.
LEADFEMALE:Have a good time.
LEADFEMALE:Be careful.
SUPFEMALE:Be careful.
OTHERMALE:That's okay, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:We know you meant well.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for the pity, Jonathan.
LEADFEMALE:I blew it in front of all the munchkins.
LEADFEMALE:What am I gonna tell Mindy about her record player? Everybody with a working record player take one step forward.
LEADFEMALE:Not so fast, McConnell.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:What makes you think something's wrong with your record player? What? All right, all right.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you.
LEADMALE:Well, your record player is se habla appliance, finito.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, not again.
OTHERMALE:I just got this thing fixed last week.
LEADMALE:Well, obviously, the repairman did a crummy job.
LEADFEMALE:I thought everyone on Earth took pride in what they did, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Well, most do, Mork.
LEADMALE:Let's just hope this repairman is one of them.
LEADFEMALE:Strange.
LEADMALE:Throughout the universe, all work is guaranteed.
SUPMALE:Even I have a warranty from the laboratory I was made in.
OTHERFEMALE:- For what? - Well, ankle blowouts, rusted skin.
OTHERFEMALE:Coughing up frogs.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:They guarantee Orkans? Yeah, I was the only Orkan ever to be recalled.
SUPMALE:What? Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell me you coughed up a frog.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:I was jogging at the speed of sound.
LEADMALE:I turned the corner real fast, and my rear end fell off.
LEADFEMALE:But-- But they fixed it, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:No ifs, ands or butts.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Strand's Repair Shop? This is Mindy McConnell.
SUPMALE:Yes, the same one that called you this morning.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I'd try to convince you one more time.
LEADFEMALE:But I already paid for it once.
OTHERMALE:Tough what? Now, listen you-- Wait, don't put me on hold.
LEADFEMALE:I-- They put me on hold.
SUPFEMALE:Come in.
SUPMALE:I mean, come in.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Did we catch you at a bad time? I hate it when they put you on hold.
SUPFEMALE:And they're playing ''Put On A Happy Face.
SUPMALE:'' Oh, I'll just call him back later.
SUPMALE:My, my, it isn't often we see the dark side of Mindy Poppins.
LEADMALE:We're gonna take a little drive up into the snow, and we thought maybe you and Mork wanted to come and help build snowwomen.
LEADMALE:Anatomically correct until the sun comes out.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks, you guys, but Mork's not here, and I'm too ticked off to go anywhere.
SUPMALE:Wait, we're family, and we think as one.
LEADMALE:Let me guess what's troubling you.
SUPFEMALE:Crime in the streets? Yes, but not this time.
LEADMALE:I'm mad because I took my stereo down to have it fixed last week, and this week, it doesn't work again for the same reason, and I can't get the repairman to stand behind his work and fix it again.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I have a system that works for me when something breaks down.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it'll work for you.
LEADMALE:- What's that? - I throw it away and buy a new one.
LEADMALE:Glenda, you'd throw away a perfectly good stereo? Well, I'd take the records off first.
LEADMALE:Isn't that a little bit wasteful? No, not really.
LEADMALE:I do it to relieve stress.
SUPMALE:You see, I just don't throw things away.
LEADFEMALE:I give them a sound thrashing first.
LEADMALE:Glenda, you're so esoteric.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I like about you.
SUPMALE:And that's what I like about you.
LEADMALE:That you like that about me.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Glenda, I feel the stirrings of something special between us, don't you? No.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe if I got her drunk.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, kiss those repair blues goodbye.
OTHERMALE:Boy.
OTHERMALE:Boy, we're gonna sue that sucker real bad.
LEADMALE:We're gonna habeas his corpus, or my name isn't F.
LEADFEMALE:Lee Mork.
LEADMALE:What's the little jellybean chattering about now? I'm not chattering at all.
LEADFEMALE:After I read these law books from the library-- Look.
SUPMALE:Look at this, Mind.
SUPMALE:''Disney v.
OTHERFEMALE:Duck.
SUPMALE:'' When did you get a library card? Card? You can't take books out of the library without a card.
LEADFEMALE:No wonder that old lady hurdled over the desk and chased me.
SUPFEMALE:She would have caught me too if her cane hadn't snapped.
LEADFEMALE:Nice try, guy, but you're wasting your time.
LEADFEMALE:- Lawsuits drag on for years.
LEADFEMALE:- Why does justice take so long? Because lawyers are paid by the hour.
SUPMALE:Well, I just can't let him get away with this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going down there and I'm gonna make him fix this thing.
OTHERFEMALE:If he won't, at least I'll have the satisfaction of giving him a good piece of my mind.
LEADMALE:I should go.
LEADFEMALE:In case you give him too much, you might need someone to show you the way home.
LEADMALE:Mindy, you should come on that drive with us.
LEADFEMALE:A couple of hours in the snow, and you'll see how unimportant turntables are in the grand scheme of Iife.
LEADMALE:It puts everything into perspective.
SUPMALE:The crisp, chilly, frosty air.
LEADMALE:It's a winter wonderland.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thanks, you guys.
SUPFEMALE:It sounds great, but I have to take care of this.
LEADFEMALE:While we're in that wonderland, we could do some favours for people, like we'll chip the frozen birds off the trees and fling them south.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy, Mork.
SUPMALE:- I hope I can hold my temper.
LEADMALE:- That's all right, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Here, you hold the record player.
SUPMALE:I'll hold your temper.
SUPMALE:- Can you just put it on the table there? - Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That's him.
LEADFEMALE:That's Mr.
SUPMALE:Strand.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he seems like a nice man.
SUPFEMALE:Watch this.
SUPMALE:- Hello.
LEADFEMALE:- What the hell do you want? Mind, not my lucky day.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Strand, I'd like you to fix this.
LEADMALE:Wasn't this thing in here last week? As a matter of fact, it was, and it still doesn't work.
LEADMALE:- So? - So I think you should fix it.
SUPFEMALE:Sure, I'd be happy to fix it for you.
LEADFEMALE:- You would? - Yep, for my basic service charge.
LEADMALE:- What? - He said his basic-- I heard what he said, Mork, but that's not fair.
LEADMALE:I brought this thing in last week.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't fix it right.
SUPMALE:I think now you should fix it again for free.
LEADMALE:Look, lady, this thing worked fine when it left the shop here.
OTHERMALE:You want that fixed free? You gotta go to the manufacturer.
SUPMALE:- Okay, where is that? - Taiwan.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:When do they close? Listen, mister.
LEADFEMALE:For your information, I happen to work for KTNS-TV, and I think a lot of people would be real interested to hear how you do business.
LEADMALE:Terrific.
LEADMALE:While you're at it, why don't you tell them about this mixer? It's been here for a month.
SUPFEMALE:It belongs to Ralph Nader.
LEADFEMALE:Now, get out of my shop.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, if I wasn't a lady, I'd drop him.
LEADFEMALE:That's all right, Mind, I'm no lady.
SUPFEMALE:Watch this.
SUPMALE:All right, sir, you think you're so tough? Come on.
LEADFEMALE:I dare you to knock this off my shoulder.
LEADMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, hey, you're talking to a guy that doesn't know the meaning of the word quit.
LEADMALE:Oh, quit: verb, intransitive, means to cease or desist a plan of action.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:Go on.
LEADMALE:Out, out, get out of here.
LEADMALE:All right, we're going, but you haven't heard the last from me, Mr.
LEADMALE:Strand.
OTHERMALE:And you haven't seen the last of her, Mr.
LEADMALE:Strand.
LEADFEMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:Get the heck out of here.
LEADMALE:Couldn't we talk this over a couple of sissy drinks in a fern bar? I'm warning you.
LEADFEMALE:What are you, Jack the Whipper? Come on, you wanna mix it up with me? - Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
OTHERMALE:- I'm not afraid of you.
LEADMALE:- No? Yeah, but my feet are.
LEADFEMALE:Two to one, they win.
SUPMALE:Don't fail me now.
SUPMALE:Mind, Mork is one consumer who's had enough.
LEADMALE:Listen, I've written all the way to the top.
LEADFEMALE:''Dear Pope John Paul.
LEADFEMALE:'' ''Morkus Orkus.
LEADFEMALE:'' Oh, talk about your fast service.
OTHERFEMALE:That's His Eminence now.
LEADMALE:Mind, get some ermine.
LEADFEMALE:Quick, get some ermine.
OTHERFEMALE:Ave Mari-- Oh, it's you.
SUPFEMALE:I thought it was the guy with the little red shoes.
LEADMALE:Don't try to figure it out.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, look, I was on my way home from rehearsal, and I thought I'd drop by and take a look at your record player.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Dad, but it's a complicated machine.
LEADFEMALE:Well, honey, I used to fix all your toys.
SUPMALE:Remember when I put that front wheel back on your tricycle? It worked fine.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, until the night I rode down Feldman's hill.
LEADFEMALE:But you said the sparks were pretty.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Pops, I didn't know you were an appliance doctor.
LEADFEMALE:- Dad.
SUPMALE:- Well, it always works on my TV.
SUPMALE:Hey, here's that screwdriver you asked to borrow.
SUPFEMALE:Be careful with it.
OTHERMALE:My parents gave it to me for graduation.
SUPFEMALE:It tells you a lot about the folks, doesn't it? - That's a real sweet gift, Bick.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yeah, it's a family trait.
LEADMALE:I hope the screwdriver doesn't work.
LEADMALE:It's nice to have a break from that sound-effects record Mork keeps playing.
LEADFEMALE:It's not easy to get a woman in the mood with the sound of stampeding elephants coming from the next apartment.
SUPMALE:No, no, no, that's Ferrets in Love.
SUPMALE:I'll wait for the video disc.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:We'll get it fixed.
SUPFEMALE:I'll have this manual figured out in two or three weeks.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I had a typewriter fixed once, but when I started writing my greeting cards, it still wouldn't type the letter L.
LEADMALE:Can you imagine? Good uck on your trip.
SUPFEMALE:Nighty night.
SUPMALE:Oh, hello, Fred, it's always fun.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, why don't we just save ourselves the aggravation, and I'll pay for the repair myself? Oh, Dad.
SUPMALE:I mean, thanks, anyway, but it's the principle here that counts.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, millions of people are taken advantage of like this every year.
LEADMALE:Well, there's gotta be some way of getting justice.
LEADFEMALE:Justice.
SUPMALE:Wheels turning.
LEADFEMALE:Something's happening Something big Mork has a better idea, Mind.
SUPMALE:Mork, what's going on in that fertile Orkan mind? Oh, nothing.
SUPMALE:Nothing at all.
LEADFEMALE:Just that justice moves in strange ways.
SUPFEMALE:See you later.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and I thought he'd never adjust.

OTHERFEMALE:We're closed up for the-- - I'm getting out of here.
LEADMALE:- No.

SUPMALE:It's a foreign import.
LEADMALE:I'll have to translate.
LEADFEMALE:Hold it right there, please.
LEADMALE:Hold it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this man would sell his mother to his father.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:I've done nothing wrong, I tell you.
LEADFEMALE:- Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing wrong.
LEADMALE:- Oh, yes? - Yes.
LEADFEMALE:- Au contraire, mon skinflint.

OTHERMALE:- Grigri? We have another witness here to testify against you.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Harry P.
LEADMALE:Dryer.
LEADFEMALE:Harry, will you please tell the court what this man has done to you? Your Honour, what can I say? He's an animal.
SUPMALE:He's abused me.
SUPMALE:If I had a foot, I'd stamp it.
LEADMALE:Your Honour, I never laid a hand on him.
LEADMALE:Why am I pleading to a TV? Members of the jury, do you believe this man? It's a frame-up.
SUPFEMALE:I'm innocent.
LEADMALE:I tell you, it's a frame-up.
LEADFEMALE:I'm innocent.
SUPMALE:Innocent.
LEADFEMALE:Innocent.
LEADFEMALE:Order in the court.
LEADFEMALE:Order in the courtroom now.
LEADFEMALE:- I'm innocent.
LEADFEMALE:- I said quiet! Clerk, strike that noise from the record, please.
OTHERMALE:Well, when do I get a chance to speak for myself? Oh, of course.
LEADMALE:I'm your defence lawyer too.
LEADMALE:- You? - Yes, I'm AC/DC.
LEADMALE:Hey, don't worry about nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you worry about a thing.
LEADMALE:Hey, we'll get you out of here before you can say John Dean.
OTHERMALE:Don't worry about this.
LEADMALE:It's weird, these things talking to you.
LEADMALE:Don't let it bother you.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to call a surprise witness.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about that.
SUPMALE:A surprise witness for you.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey, how are you? How are? I've been in Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Strand's shop now for over 40 years.
LEADFEMALE:So much for the defence.
LEADFEMALE:- I don't know what happened.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, I was gonna fix it tomorrow.
LEADMALE:I was.
LEADMALE:I was.
LEADFEMALE:Jury, have you reached a verdict? I'm innocent.
LEADFEMALE:I'm innocent! I'll change! I give you my word! The verdict is guilty.
LEADFEMALE:Have mercy on me.
LEADFEMALE:And your word has been broken so many times.
SUPMALE:- It's beyond repair.
SUPMALE:- Have mercy! I beg of you! Court is adjourned.
SUPMALE:And order in the court.
LEADMALE:Order in the court.
SUPFEMALE:Order in the court.
LEADFEMALE:Wha? It couldn't have been real.
OTHERMALE:No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:- Yeah, I must have been dreaming.
SUPMALE:- No way, sucker.
SUPFEMALE:How are we feeling today? Let's see.
SUPFEMALE:Let's take a look.
SUPFEMALE:Thirty-three and a third.
LEADMALE:Not too bad.
LEADFEMALE:Cough.
LEADFEMALE:Cough.
OTHERFEMALE:- Morning.
LEADMALE:- Oh, morning, Mind.
LEADMALE:Feign nonchalance.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, I think today is a wonderful day to take the record player back to the shop.
OTHERMALE:No, Mork, I think today is a wonderful day to go to work, and make money to buy a new one.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I think things would be a lot different if you'd take it back today.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, there's this kind of Strange feeling passing through me Mork, you didn't happen to go to the repair shop Iast night, did you? Could be.
LEADMALE:And you didn't happen to talk to Mr.
LEADMALE:Strand, did you? Could be, part two.
LEADFEMALE:Why am I worried to hear about could be, part three? Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Miss McConnell? I I just came by to apologize to you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm taking care of all my dissatisfied customers personally.
LEADMALE:Let's see now.
SUPMALE:You had the record player, right? - Right.
SUPFEMALE:- Yeah, well, I'll have this back to you early Monday morning.
LEADMALE:It'll be all fixed free of charge.
LEADMALE:Well, that's great, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Strand, but why the sudden change of heart? Well, let's just say that I-- I had a nightmare last night.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, it made me realize that I should take a lot more pride in my work.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this has got a little scratch.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you ought to treat your appliances with a lot more respect.
SUPFEMALE:They have feelings too, you know? Come on.
SUPMALE:Come on, little fella, here we go.
LEADFEMALE:See you.
SUPMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:Mork, he's like a completely different man.
LEADMALE:- What could have gotten into him? - Oh, nothing on Earth, Mind.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:When you went to the repair shop, you didn't happen toanything, did you? Wrong hand, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you know you shouldn't go around zapping things all the time.
SUPMALE:But this time you did good.
OTHERFEMALE:I did good? Well, that's the second time this week.
OTHERMALE:Oh, what was the first time? Remember you said, ''Anyone who's really famous in television has their name known all over town''? Mind, you are gonna be up there in lights.
LEADFEMALE:- I mean, a known success.
SUPMALE:- I am? See, I went all over Boulder, and wrote your name in every phone booth in town.
SUPMALE:For a perky time, call Mindy.
LEADMALE:That's for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello? Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Your Boob-Tubeness.
SUPMALE:- ls that you, Mork? - Oh, yes, sir.
SUPMALE:Talk about your bad connections here.
SUPMALE:Beebs, have you been chewing on the lines again? Lorne Greene said kibble, not cable.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork, pull yourself together.
LEADFEMALE:- Yes, sir.
LEADMALE:Good to have you back.
LEADMALE:Sorry, sir, I lost my head.
OTHERMALE:Have you been tinkering with your knobs again? Oh, no way, sir.
SUPMALE:I just had my 3,000-report checkup.
LEADMALE:I must be suffering from that universal disease called shoddy workmanship.
LEADMALE:One of the main symptoms is feeling like you've just been ripped off.
SUPFEMALE:What causes this disease? Well, sir, apathy, lack of pride in one's work, greed.
LEADFEMALE:What happened to responsibility? Well, sir, it's in the shop.
SUPFEMALE:It'll be ready Tuesday.
SUPFEMALE:You see, I've learned that most Earthlings consider a job just a way of making money.
LEADMALE:lsn't there a saying on Earth, ''Money talks''? Yeah, sir, but nothing speaks as eloquently as a job well done, or Brooke Shields' jeans saying, ''Give me air.
LEADMALE:'' Until next week, sir.
LEADMALE:I love my new job.
LEADMALE:I just wish the station would give me better assignments.
SUPMALE:All I've been covering lately are grocery store openings and flower exhibits and that dumb dog show this afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, are you kidding? Those dogs are great little performers.
LEADMALE:I wonder why that guy got mad when I tried to wind up his toy poodle.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:- Hi, it's me.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, hi.
LEADFEMALE:I saw you come in.
SUPFEMALE:You know how I hate to bother you two, but I'm having a very special lady over tomorrow night, Lorraine Sue Ruttenberg, and I'd like to borrow a few record albums.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, is this someone important? - Hopefully.
LEADMALE:I'm bringing her all the way from Phoenix at enormous expense.
SUPMALE:Do you realise how much bus fare is these days? Well, I'll get you the record albums.
LEADFEMALE:You're probably looking to set the proper mood, eh? No, I'm looking for cheap thrills.
SUPMALE:Oh, here's one of my favourites: Or a bat can go: I was thinking more along the lines of Perry Como.
SUPFEMALE:All I have is his Christmas album.
LEADMALE:Perfect.
LEADMALE:''Little Drummer Boy'' works quicker than liquor.
SUPMALE:Well, good luck, Bick, and thanks for coming by.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, it's really-- Mork, if you don't mind, I'd like to take my hand back home with me.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Mork.
LEADMALE:Gee, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley, it's too bad you have to run.
LEADMALE:I don't think so.
OTHERMALE:That boy's a little thin from the neck up.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Mork? Mork? Oh, no, now, what am I gonna do? Mork? Bye, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Bickley.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, what happened to you? You just spaced out.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, Mind, I got a call from Orson.
LEADMALE:I had to put my body on hold.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, Mind, you'll never guess what.
LEADMALE:- I never have yet.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll never guess who's gonna grace us with his magnificent presence.
LEADFEMALE:- Who? - Xerko.
OTHERFEMALE:Xerko.
SUPMALE:One of the Marx brothers? No, no, Mind.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he's my hero, my idol.
LEADFEMALE:He's the greatest Orkan that's ever lived.
LEADFEMALE:He's coming here, Mind, he's coming here.
LEADFEMALE:Why would this Xerox wanna come here? No, no, his name is Xerko, Mind, and there's no duplicating him.
SUPMALE:I don't know why he wants to come here.
LEADFEMALE:Orson didn't tell me, I guess he wanted to make it a surprise.
OTHERFEMALE:Isn't it wonderful, though? Oh, boy, he's gonna love our little nest.
SUPMALE:It's so warm and wonderful.
LEADMALE:Oh, I've gotta clean up this pigsty.
LEADMALE:It's filthy.
SUPFEMALE:Xerko? Oh, Mork, nice to see you again.
LEADFEMALE:It's been bleams, na-no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sir, you remembered my insignificant, dirt ball name.
OTHERFEMALE:Why of course, Mork.
LEADMALE:My memory is impeccable.
OTHERMALE:Oh, and the rest of us are merely peccable, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sir, na-no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's been so long, sir.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna have to have this hand bronzed.
LEADMALE:Sir, sir, how was your journey? It was delightful, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, I came via Air Ork's H-28 prototype beam.
LEADMALE:Oh, travelling by beam.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, who thought of that? Well, actually, Mork, I did.
LEADFEMALE:What will I think of next? Oh, what a guy.
LEADMALE:I mean-- Why are you here? Orson didn't tell me.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, did I win spend-a-day-with-a-hero contest? No, no, but we'll have plenty of time to talk about my mission later.
LEADMALE:Mork, I admire very much, admire very much what you've done with this environment.
LEADMALE:Oh, you admire something of mine, sir? You'll find that I admire many things of yours.
LEADMALE:Oh, I see you have an Orkan landscape.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, it's a Van Yuch.
LEADMALE:I have a good ear for paintings.
LEADMALE:How nice.
LEADFEMALE:I have the original, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Van Yuch himself is hanging in my house.
LEADFEMALE:I hope somebody remembers to feed him while I'm gone.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I wanna talk about your Earth reports.
LEADFEMALE:Now, they've become so colourful that Earth is being considered an up-and-coming planet on the move.
LEADMALE:We broke the top 40? - I mean, we're 1 6 with a bullet? - That's right.
OTHERFEMALE:But it seems that the Earth people are so hungry for leadership.
LEADFEMALE:They need someone to guide them into the next century.
LEADMALE:And I know just the Orkan who can do it.
LEADMALE:Thank you, sir, I'd better go hop in the shower.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
OTHERMALE:Mork, silly misguided Mork.
OTHERMALE:I was referring, of course, to myself.
LEADMALE:Twinkle of eye, sparkle of teeth.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, me, vacuous of head.
OTHERFEMALE:I should have known better.
OTHERMALE:I mean, you're the best there is in the whole universe.
LEADFEMALE:I ought to know, I'm a Xerko groupie.
OTHERMALE:See? Well, remind me to send you a Xerko lunchbox.
SUPMALE:Sir, I mean, I can't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:Why am I so lucky? Because, Mork, you are a key person in my plan for success.
LEADFEMALE:Plan? What's your plan, sir, please? What's the plan--? Mork, you are so inquisitive.
LEADMALE:Now, that's what sets us apart.
LEADFEMALE:You ask and I know.
SUPFEMALE:But you must be patient, my friend.
LEADMALE:This also involves your Earthling, Mindy, as well.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to explain it to the two of you when you're together.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, sir.
LEADMALE:I mean, once again, you're right, Your Everything.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I can wait just till morning, you know, that's: Morning already? Come, sir, let's go, come here.
LEADMALE:Oh, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Not necessary.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sir, even though Mindy's asleep, she's gonna be thrilled to meet you.
LEADMALE:Well, who can blame her? Mind, wake up and come out and be filled with awe.
LEADFEMALE:I hope she's wearing her bunny slippers, they're so cute.
SUPFEMALE:- Hi.
SUPFEMALE:- I thought you were asleep.
OTHERMALE:Are you kidding? How could I sleep knowing I'm gonna have a guest from another galaxy? Is he here yet? Oh, I don't know, really, Mind, I really don't.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, meet Xerko.
LEADFEMALE:See him, feel him, touch him.
LEADFEMALE:Well, hello.
SUPMALE:Hello, Mindy.
LEADMALE:This is indeed a pleasure.
OTHERFEMALE:I've heard so much about you through Mork's reports to Orson.
SUPMALE:I must say you're even more lovely.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, well, thank you.
SUPMALE:Isn't he wonderful, Mind? Isn't he everything you ever dreamed of, especially compared to worm sweat like me? Welcome to Earth, or na-no, na-no, or whatever I'm supposed to say.
LEADMALE:Say what you feel.
SUPFEMALE:Are you sure you're an Orkan? Of course I am, but I've studied your ways and I find Earth a fascinating planet.
LEADFEMALE:Very fascinating.
LEADFEMALE:And you help make it that way.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, shucks and wazoo.
LEADFEMALE:Where have I heard that before? Mind, he's got a wonderful surprise to tell us.
SUPMALE:He had to tell us when we're together.
LEADMALE:- What's that surprise, Xerko? - I want your job.
SUPMALE:Oh, shucks.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, what--? He wants my job.
LEADMALE:What do you mean, you want his job? Well, after a mere formality, the ancient duel of the Hollitacker, I will become Ork's new observer here on Earth.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, you have everything.
LEADMALE:Why do you want what I have? Your reports are becoming too popular and I can't have that.
SUPMALE:Unless, of course, I'm giving them.
SUPFEMALE:It would be a giant step in my illustrious career.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm what he wants to step in.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mind, I don't have any chance against Xerko the Godlike.
LEADMALE:You two will be very happy together.
LEADFEMALE:Really, you really will.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you can't just give up.
OTHERMALE:Yup, sure can.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm going outside to re-carve that heart that's out on the tree outside to say: ''Xerko and Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:'' Goodbye.
SUPMALE:Oh, by the way, she likes her bologna sundaes without bologna.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, I thought I could handle this myself, but-- You better sit down.
LEADMALE:Another Orkan has come to replace Mork and live with me.
LEADMALE:I better sit down.
LEADMALE:Are you saying there's another Orkan in this house right now? Yeah, his name is Xerko.
SUPMALE:And he and Mork are gonna have some kind of game called a Holliquacker or Tacker.
LEADMALE:I don't know what it is.
LEADMALE:What's that? Well, it's when one Orkan challenges another for his job.
OTHERMALE:He's really trying to take over and I don't know what to do about it.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, don't worry.
LEADMALE:I'll have a talk with this Xerko.
LEADFEMALE:It isn't that easy.
SUPMALE:He's been here less than a day and he's already tuned up my Jeep, made all his own Earth clothes and scraped the bugs out of my ceiling lights.
OTHERMALE:Well, I don't care what he's done.
SUPMALE:He just can't come barging into other people's planets and take over.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, little Bebo, we'll have tickle time again tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Come on, little fellow.
OTHERMALE:Now, listen, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Zero.
SUPMALE:Oh, you mean Xerko.
LEADMALE:You must be Mindy's biological father.
LEADFEMALE:How do you do, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:McConnell? It's a pleasure to meet you.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:But I really think we should have a talk.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, wonderful, wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Shall we all sit down? Please.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, may I say how nice it is to see people dressing for dinner again.
LEADMALE:He's dressed that way because he's the conductor for the Boulder Symphony Orchestra.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what an honour.
LEADMALE:May I ask you, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:McConnell, do you enjoy Stravinsky? Stravinsky? How do you know about Stravinsky? Oh, we monitor all Earth broadcasts.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I thought that Stravinsky reached his zenith during ''Rites of Spring'', until, of course, I heard his ''Firebird Suite''.
LEADMALE:Do you agree? You know-- You know, you're right.
SUPMALE:You must have quite a musical background.
SUPMALE:Well, actually, I composed the Ork national anthem.
LEADFEMALE:I wrote the song that made my whole world sing.
SUPFEMALE:Really? That's quite impressive.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Mr.
LEADMALE:McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:- Call me Fred.
LEADFEMALE:- Why, I'd like that.
SUPFEMALE:I'd also like to see you conduct sometime.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, as a matter of fact, I have a performance in less than an hour and I'm late.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, can I come along with you, Fred? - Of course.
OTHERMALE:You'd enjoy it.
LEADFEMALE:Tonight we're doing Schubert's ''Unfinished Symphony''.
LEADMALE:Marvellous.
SUPMALE:Maybe I can finished it for him.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, remember Mork? Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, now-- Now, Xerko-- - Here's your coat, Fred.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Nice coat.
SUPMALE:You don't happen to have the pattern, do you? And now, really, now listen, you just can't come down to Earth and move in like this.
SUPMALE:Now, please, I understand your concern, but Mork's been here for a couple of years and you've had a chance to grow attached to him.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure, if given time, you'll grow attached to me too.
SUPMALE:- Well, you like Stravinsky.
SUPMALE:- Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, Xerko seems like a civilised being.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure that I can reason with him.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye.
LEADMALE:Remember, the Hollitacker's at midnight.
LEADMALE:I want you there when Mork concedes, and wear something tight.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Mork isn't gonna concede if I have anything to do with it.
LEADMALE:He might not believe in himself, but I believe in Mork.
LEADMALE:I love it when you're angry.
LEADMALE:Who said you had to go to Disneyland to have fun on Earth? You're an E-ticket.
LEADMALE:Mork, stop that packing.
LEADMALE:You're not a quitter.
LEADMALE:Look, I understand how you feel.
OTHERMALE:When I was a little girl, there was this kid in school who was always the best at everything.
OTHERFEMALE:She was class president and cafeteria monitor and teacher's pet.
OTHERFEMALE:The one thing I was really good at in school was spelling.
SUPFEMALE:But she was better.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we should get her to fight the Hollitacker, Mind.
LEADMALE:Every year at the school spelling bee, there were only just two of us left on the stage, her and me.
SUPFEMALE:And every year, she was always the last one standing on that stage.
SUPFEMALE:But I kept trying, until one time it was just down between the two of us, and the word was hors d'oeuvres.
LEADMALE:And she blew it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, it was wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:You mean, you beat her? You won? Yeah.
LEADMALE:And I still have the ribbon to prove it.
LEADFEMALE:See, you can do it if you try.
OTHERFEMALE:How are you gonna know otherwise? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you're right, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:- You really think I have a chance? - Sure, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:If you want something, you'll find a way to get it.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:- I know you can do it.
SUPMALE:Yeah, yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I can do it.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Whatever happened to that girl, Mind? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I kind of lost track of her after she won the Nobel Prize.
SUPFEMALE:Let the Hollitacker begin.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, come down and be defeated.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mindy, you look absolutely beautiful.
OTHERFEMALE:After I win, I will present you with the fruits of my victory, Mork's ears.
LEADMALE:Ears? Well, Mork told me this was a non-violent contest.
LEADMALE:Oh, it is.
LEADFEMALE:Orkan ears screw off.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, do I take your continued absence to mean a forfeit? Never.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just waiting till my knees to stop knocking.
SUPFEMALE:Mork runs from no man.
OTHERMALE:And tonight, I'm gonna try-- Try to do my best.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe it's a good night to do my laundry, Mind.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Remember, no matter what happens, you're a winner to me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, thank you, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:I brought the ribbon that I won at the spelling bee.
OTHERMALE:I want you to wear it to remind you of a little girl who wouldn't give up.
LEADMALE:- Oh, thank you, Mind.
LEADMALE:- Okay? There you go.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck, Mork.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, Mind.
SUPMALE:Pardon me.
OTHERFEMALE:- I'll try even though it does clash.
LEADMALE:- Okay.
LEADFEMALE:- Give him hell.
LEADMALE:- All right, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:The choice of weapons goes to the challenger.
OTHERFEMALE:And I choose the Swords of Cletus.
SUPFEMALE:I was hoping he'd opt for spatulas, Mind.
LEADMALE:Take your pick.
SUPMALE:Eenie, meenie, minie, Cletus, hope he doesn't try to cheat us.
LEADMALE:This one.
OTHERMALE:But I don't see anything.
SUPFEMALE:Of course not.
SUPFEMALE:The Swords of Cletus are invisible.
LEADMALE:Observe.
LEADMALE:Oh, I get the point.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's nothing.
OTHERMALE:You see that fly up there? Yeah, but it's still alive.
LEADMALE:Yes, but wait till he tries to land.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:All right, we all know the rules here, don't we? First man to push his opponent back through the goals wins the Hollitacker.
LEADMALE:Now, I want a clean fight here.
LEADFEMALE:And cross blades and may the second-best Orkan win.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck, Mork.
LEADMALE:You can do it.
SUPMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Not now, not now.
OTHERMALE:Begin.
LEADFEMALE:Don't fall in.
LEADFEMALE:It always looked easier from the stands, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Time out.
SUPMALE:- Time in.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, time in? A little closer.
OTHERMALE:Mind, your help, please.
LEADFEMALE:If you find the sword, you'll recognise it.
OTHERFEMALE:It's the only one you can't see.
SUPFEMALE:My furniture.
LEADMALE:It's all right, my dear.
LEADFEMALE:When I move in, I'll redecorate.
SUPMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:It's for you, Mind.
OTHERMALE:We've been cut off.
LEADMALE:- Mind.
LEADMALE:- Oh, I think I've found it.
SUPMALE:Can you try to hurry up, Mind? No pressure.
SUPFEMALE:One, two, three.
SUPMALE:- Here, catch.
LEADFEMALE:- Mind.
LEADMALE:Pick on me when I'm down, huh? Well, I'm not anymore.
LEADFEMALE:I'm coming.
OTHERFEMALE:Make way, Mind.
LEADMALE:Don't make them like they used to.
LEADFEMALE:- Quick, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Not now, my sweet, have patience.
LEADMALE:What's going on in there? Ixnay on the ollitackerhay.
LEADMALE:What have you got against love? Lorraine Sue's heart was beating faster than the little drummer boy's stick and you have to start playing hide and go kinky.
SUPFEMALE:And what's the situation now? Lorraine Sue is thumbing her way back to Phoenix and I'm left with my motor racing and no place to park.
LEADMALE:Oh, and by the way, don't bother trying to explain this.
SUPMALE:I'm sure I'll be filled in by the vice squad later.
SUPMALE:All right, Mork, it's been fun, but all good things must come to an end.
SUPFEMALE:Earth and Mindy are now mine.
LEADFEMALE:Eat garlic.
LEADMALE:- Please, Mork.
LEADMALE:- You've got it in for you.
LEADMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:You've gone too far now.
LEADFEMALE:You've cut Mindy's ribbon.
LEADFEMALE:And that, this is for Mindy.
LEADMALE:That's for the couch, that's for the fly, that's for the candle and this is for-- I hope you didn't take anything I said seriously.
SUPFEMALE:Heat of the battle and all that rot.
LEADMALE:All right, Mork.
LEADMALE:Enough is enough.
SUPMALE:It's time to draw this to a close.
LEADMALE:Not a bad little dueller.
LEADMALE:Not a bad little dancer.
SUPMALE:Goodbye, Mork.
LEADMALE:You did it.
LEADFEMALE:You won.
SUPFEMALE:I don't believe it.
LEADMALE:You won.
LEADMALE:I didn't win.
LEADFEMALE:It was your ribbon that really helped.
LEADMALE:Congratulations.
LEADMALE:You fought valiantly.
LEADFEMALE:I've never lost anything before.
SUPFEMALE:I just can't imagine being beaten by Mork.
LEADMALE:Well, I think you've learned a good lesson.
LEADMALE:On Earth, it's called humility.
LEADMALE:Humility.
LEADMALE:Yes, strange new stirrings within me.
LEADMALE:I'm beginning to feel it.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, thanks to you, Mork, I have acquired humility.
LEADMALE:Now, I have everything.
SUPMALE:I'll be the perfect leader for the next planet I decide to grace with my presence.
SUPMALE:Well, goodbye.
SUPMALE:Beam me up, Scotty.
LEADFEMALE:Farewell, my flawed leader.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mork, I sure am proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know something, Mind, me too.
LEADMALE:- Sorry the house is kind of torn apart.
SUPMALE:- Yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, I guess the most important thing is that you're back together again.
SUPFEMALE:The very most important thing is that we're back together again, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you never told me that Orkan ears unscrew.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, I'm afraid to ask what else comes off.
LEADMALE:You got me, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:I've tried everything.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Your Grand-Central-Stationness.
SUPFEMALE:- Are you still there, Mork? - Oh, yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:l heard X erko challenged you to a Hollitacker.
LEADMALE:He did, sir.
SUPMALE:But I came, I saw, I conquered.
SUPMALE:What? What? All right, sir, actually, I quivered, I ran, I squeaked by.
OTHERMALE:Jizzix the Greek gave odds that you wouldn't even show up.
LEADFEMALE:- I know that, sir.
LEADMALE:- l'm out big bucks, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Me too, sir.
SUPMALE:I lost 20 myself.
LEADFEMALE:But I found something even more valuable, sir.
LEADFEMALE:I learned that if you bet against yourself, you always lose.
SUPMALE:A little proverb from Monty Hall.
LEADMALE:But you wound up winning, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Doesn't that feel good? Oh, yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:But what makes me feel better is the fact that I tried.
LEADMALE:You see, it's not what's in front of you that blocks your way, it's what's inside of you that holds you back.
LEADMALE:The problem with you is what's inside of you is what's in front of you.
LEADMALE:A little shot for betting against me.
LEADMALE:Until next week, Your Green-Felt-Jungleness.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Well, I know he's a big star.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I want to interview him for KTNS.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I have to go through his manager, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Morra.
LEADMALE:I see.
LEADMALE:Well, could you have Mr.
LEADMALE:Morra's secretary return my call? Okay, very good.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:I wonder if Woodward and Bernstein had this much trouble trying to get to Nixon.
OTHERFEMALE:How do you like these new threads, Mind? Aren't they incredible? Do you think it's more Sears or GQ? - What are you so dressed up for? - It's picture day at the daycare centre.
LEADFEMALE:- How do I look? - Oh, you look real nice.
SUPFEMALE:Except don't forget to hold in your stomach.
SUPFEMALE:- What are you dressed up for? - I've got a big interview today.
LEADMALE:- How do I look? - Oh, real nice.
LEADFEMALE:But don't forget to hold in your thighs.
LEADMALE:Who are you gonna interview today? Oh, Mork, I'm so excited.
SUPFEMALE:Dewey Fishbeck, our feature writer, is out with the mumps.
SUPMALE:And Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Sternhagen, my boss, wants me to interview you'll never guess who.
SUPFEMALE:Let me try.
SUPFEMALE:Rula Lenska.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Menachem Begin.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Give up? Yeah, I don't know who it is.
LEADMALE:Who is it? Who, who, who, Mind? Robin Williams.
LEADFEMALE:Who? Robin Williams.
LEADMALE:What's so funny about that? Does he really call himself Robin? Well, yeah.
LEADMALE:Do you know what robin means on Ork? No.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's disgusting.
LEADMALE:Don't look at me.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't give him that smutty name.
LEADFEMALE:His parents must have had a sense of humour, though, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe you've never heard of him.
SUPMALE:He's a comedian.
SUPMALE:He's a star of TV, movies and nightclubs.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, he's in town right now doing a big solar energy benefit.
LEADMALE:Well, I still don't know what the big deal is, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you want to talk to him? Well, a lot of people on Earth are real interested to hear what stars have to say.
LEADMALE:I'm waiting for his manager to call me back to set up an appointment right now.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, you Iook a Iittle bit Iike him.
LEADMALE:Me-o? Yeah, you-o.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna get his album.
SUPMALE:I wanna show you.
LEADMALE:You're not gonna believe this.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you look a lot like him.
OTHERMALE:Come on now, Mind.
LEADMALE:This guy's gonna drown if he goes out in the rain.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, Mind.
LEADMALE:Scoff, scoff.
LEADMALE:I mean, April Frinkle's Day.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mork, you look exactly like him.
LEADMALE:Oh, now, come on now, Mind, look at that there, look at that.
SUPFEMALE:He looks like he does his hair with a Cuisinart.
LEADMALE:And he's got a road map for eyes.
LEADFEMALE:You could pack a family in that nose, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Look at that mouth too.
LEADMALE:They had to airbrush his entire face.
SUPFEMALE:Are you kidding? Mind, listen, I'm bright and cheery.
LEADMALE:This guy's got big problems.
OTHERFEMALE:Where is the interview with Robin Williams? Well, I've been having a little trouble with that.
SUPMALE:He won't return any of my calls.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, how do you reach someone who's inaccessible? Inaccessible? Last night, Mr.
LEADMALE:Williams dropped in to the Comedy Cabaret and performed for nothing.
SUPMALE:Well, how was I supposed to know? Well, even I knew about it.
SUPFEMALE:I heard it from Armondo.
SUPFEMALE:Who's Armondo? The fellow fumigating my office.
LEADMALE:He got to see one of Robin Williams' shows? No.
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Williams mentioned it to Armondo today over lunch.
LEADMALE:Robin introduced himself to everyone at DaVinci's Restaurant.
OTHERMALE:He was at Remo and Jeanie's restaurant? Oh, friends of yours? Not anymore.
SUPMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get that interview somehow.
LEADMALE:- You can count on me.
LEADFEMALE:- Good.
LEADMALE:The owner of the station is putting pressure on me.
OTHERFEMALE:And you know how I handle pressure.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Mindy.
SUPMALE:Done with this? No.
OTHERFEMALE:Jeanie, I'm mad at you.
LEADMALE:At me? Why? What did I do? You knew I've been trying to get an interview with Robin Williams.
OTHERFEMALE:He was here yesterday and you didn't call me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mindy, I am really sorry.
LEADFEMALE:It was crazy in here.
SUPFEMALE:It was-- Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Could you forgive me? Oh, all right.
OTHERMALE:Hi, scouts.
SUPFEMALE:What's going on? The place is so crowded I had to park in the back.
LEADMALE:Yeah, me too.
OTHERMALE:Robin Williams came in here for lunch yesterday.
SUPMALE:Everybody's waiting for him to come back.
SUPFEMALE:How tacky.
SUPMALE:Mindy, what are you doing here? Tackily waiting for him to come back.
SUPMALE:Could you come over? We have a lot of customers.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:This is a new experience for me.
OTHERFEMALE:Mindy McConnell, I'm ashamed of you.
LEADFEMALE:Hanging around here like some kind of groupie.
SUPMALE:Now, that hurts, Nelson.
OTHERMALE:I'm supposed to interview Robin for the station.
OTHERFEMALE:And it seems like everybody in town has met him except me.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm sure you're exaggerating.
SUPMALE:Hey, guys, did you see these Polaroids they have of me and Robin Williams? That's us.
LEADFEMALE:There's Robin and Jeanie.
LEADMALE:There's Robin and Armondo.
LEADFEMALE:You know, the bug guy? Good picture.
LEADMALE:The bug man gets to meet Robin Williams.
LEADFEMALE:I should have taken fumigation in college.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:I have to go.
LEADMALE:I'm getting a headache.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, is she upset.
LEADMALE:Yeah, look at this one.
SUPMALE:Picture of Robin autographing the chopped liver with his finger.
LEADMALE:I'm having this one Perma Plaqued.
LEADMALE:Good penmanship.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, he made a happy face in the O.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
OTHERFEMALE:For the owner of the car with the New Mexico license plate, please claim your car at the bottom of the hill.
LEADFEMALE:You forgot to set your handbrake.
LEADMALE:Look, everyone, it's Robin.
SUPMALE:Robin! My name is Mork.
LEADMALE:Watch your language.
OTHERFEMALE:Robin! So that's Robin Williams, huh? You know, you're gonna think I'm crazy, but he looks a little bit like Mork.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:I think you're crazy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, look, they caught him.
SUPMALE:No big deal.
LEADFEMALE:With the money he makes, he can afford new clothes.
OTHERMALE:They really shouldn't toss him up in the air like that.
LEADMALE:Well, tell Mr.
OTHERMALE:Williams that Barbara Walters called.
OTHERMALE:And when he calls back, he should ask for my secretary, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Come on in, Mr.
LEADMALE:Sternhagen.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Where'd she go? Mr.
LEADMALE:Sternhagen, did you just come from lunch? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:And l know you can't tell it, but I had two or three little drinks.
LEADMALE:And do you know why? Why? I knew I was in trouble when Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Ovitz, the woman who owns the station, plied me with drinks at lunchtime.
LEADFEMALE:She said if we don't get the interview, I'm out.
SUPFEMALE:And if I'm out Guess who's going with me? Me.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:You.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Sternhagen, I have tried everything.
LEADFEMALE:- I tried lying.
OTHERFEMALE:- That's good.
LEADFEMALE:- And I tried bribery.
LEADMALE:- Oh, that's real good.
SUPFEMALE:I even went as far as trying to buy tickets to his concert so I could sneak backstage to meet him, but they're sold-out.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you're in a predic-- You're in a predic-- You're up a creek, kiddo.
LEADMALE:The same thing happened to me in New York when I was big in the network.
LEADFEMALE:The president said I had to deliver someone or I was out.
SUPMALE:I was out.
OTHERMALE:Well, what did you do? Does this look like New York here? Well, I gotta get go-- I better go.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna leave now.
OTHERFEMALE:- Mr.
LEADMALE:Sternhagen.
LEADFEMALE:- Yes? Did you drive? Oh, yes.
SUPMALE:That's my little beauty parked out there in your hedge.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I don't think you should drive.
LEADFEMALE:I think you should take a little nap.
OTHERMALE:I can do that while I'm driving.
SUPMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Why don't you come with me? I think you should go right in there.
SUPMALE:Well, will you please fix me some cookies and warm bourbon? - Don't panic.
SUPFEMALE:- I'm not panicking.
SUPFEMALE:You have no reason to panic, Mind.
OTHERMALE:They're not after you.
SUPFEMALE:Who's after you and why? The entire town, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:They know I'm an alien.
LEADFEMALE:They chased me.
LEADMALE:They tore my clothes.
LEADFEMALE:They pursued me with fountain pens.
LEADFEMALE:Just because I'm different doesn't make me a bad guy, does it? I mean, I say my prayers, I pet my vegetables.
OTHERFEMALE:I put my pants on like everybody else, headfirst.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, how could they find out you're an alien? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:But they called me filthy names.
LEADFEMALE:Did they call you Robin? That's disgusting.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, they think you're Robin Williams.
LEADFEMALE:Who? Robin Williams, the guy who looks like you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you mean that bozo on the album? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, Mind, I don't look anything like him.
SUPMALE:They know I'm an alien.
SUPMALE:They're onto me.
LEADFEMALE:If they catch me, they're gonna tar and feather me and put me on That's lncredible! They'll put me on that.
OTHERFEMALE:l'm telling you, they think you're Robin Williams.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, now, assuming you're right-- Which I think you're way off base.
OTHERMALE:You're like in left field going, ''Where am I? Where am I?'' --would they tear Robin Williams' clothes off? - Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:- But you told me they liked him.
LEADMALE:Well, they do.
SUPMALE:That's why they want his clothes.
OTHERMALE:And if they didn't like him, boy, he'd be in real trouble.
SUPMALE:He'd be jacked up on four blocks with nothing left but his kneecaps.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's not quite like that either.
LEADMALE:Why don't you come with me tonight? You'll see how much you look like him.
OTHERFEMALE:I've gotta go to the auditorium and try to interview him.
LEADMALE:- It's my last shot.
OTHERFEMALE:- What are you gonna do, Mind? Oh, hang around the stage door till he shows up.
LEADMALE:Like some groupie? Exactly.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'll go with you as your escort, but I've gotta get disguised, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:I tell you, they're onto me.
LEADMALE:They know I'm an alien.
OTHERMALE:Mork, I wish you'd take off the silly-looking glasses.
SUPFEMALE:It's a perfect disguise, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Everyone thinks I'm from L.
LEADMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE:Watch this.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, sir.
LEADMALE:I just want you to know that there are no aliens from outer space in this area.
LEADFEMALE:- For sure.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork.
LEADMALE:Your disguise is starting to attract attention.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you'd be much less conspicuous if you'd take off the nose, pull down your hat and turn up your collar.
OTHERFEMALE:- Trust me.
LEADFEMALE:- Mind.
SUPFEMALE:- Trust me.
OTHERFEMALE:- But, Mind - Do you trust me? - Oh, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:- For you.
LEADFEMALE:- There.
LEADFEMALE:Look, it's him, Robin Williams.
SUPFEMALE:Stay back.
SUPFEMALE:Break it up.
OTHERFEMALE:Right this way, Mr.
SUPMALE:Williams.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait.
SUPMALE:I'm with him.
LEADMALE:- Is she with you, sir? - Trust me, Mind.
LEADMALE:- I've never seen this woman in my life.
OTHERMALE:- What? Just kidding, officer.
LEADMALE:It's actually my brother.
SUPFEMALE:He likes to dress up a little bit.
LEADMALE:Come along, Roland.
LEADMALE:Here's your dressing room, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Williams.
LEADFEMALE:If there's anything I can do, let me know.
LEADMALE:Yeah, a new pair of retinas would be very nice, please.
LEADFEMALE:Hard to believe you get paid for that.
LEADMALE:Do you believe it, Mork? We're in Robin Williams' dressing room.
LEADFEMALE:And we're about to meet him.
LEADMALE:I don't know what the big deal is all about.
SUPMALE:Are you kidding, Mork? People stand in line for hours just to get a glimpse of a star, let alone meet one.
LEADMALE:And we're about to meet a big star.
LEADMALE:Poor little starstruck Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Now, calm that perky little heart of yours.
LEADMALE:Don't you understand that a star's just a big ball of glowing hot gas? He's just an ordinary human being who's been hyped by an advertising campaign.
LEADMALE:Personally, I'd rather be at home right now flossing my ears.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:You know, you look a lot like No, he's a woman now.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Williams, but I have a big, big, big favour to ask of you.
OTHERFEMALE:I know you don't know me and I don't wanna impose, but I'm supposed to get an interview with you for KTNS, and if I don't, I'll be fired.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:This has been a bad year for her.
LEADFEMALE:She bet on Carter, Roberto Duran and she had to buy Chrysler stock too.
LEADMALE:Well, I got a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:My manager's not here.
LEADMALE:And sure, why not? Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:You're doing me such a big favour.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe it.
SUPMALE:This is my friend, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:And I'm Mindy McConnell.
SUPFEMALE:You're not from the Enquirer, are you? Pardon me? - Little joke.
OTHERMALE:- No.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you sure are a hard man to get in touch with.
OTHERFEMALE:You have tighter security than the pope.
LEADFEMALE:She couldn't get past your manager's secretary's secretary's secretary's answering machine.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, would you please? Sorry, Mind.
SUPMALE:I know you've probably been asked this question a lot, but what's it like to be a celebrity? Well, not bad, really.
LEADMALE:It's nice when you get into restaurants at those really chichi places where they wouldn't even let you wash the floors before.
LEADFEMALE:I have another question now, a little fashion byline.
LEADFEMALE:- Why do you wear baggy pants? - I don't want a visible panty line.
LEADFEMALE:There's your headline right there, Mind: ''Robin Williams, kinky.
LEADMALE:'' You're a member of the brotherhood of Bozo.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you wear them? That's where I keep my bees.
SUPMALE:Do you mind? Back off.
SUPFEMALE:Back off, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Williams, I don't know how you keep up the pace.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you arrived from Hawaii, fly all night and then go straight to the university and lecture for three hours.
LEADMALE:Oh, that was a fluke, you see.
LEADMALE:The pilot of the flight I was on has a daughter who attends drama class here.
LEADMALE:He asked if I'd talk to her class to return his favour.
SUPMALE:What was the favour? Well, he said if I'd lecture, he'd pull out of the dive.
LEADMALE:Interesting concept, Mind.
LEADMALE:Blackmail by gravity.
LEADMALE:Write that down.
LEADMALE:That's news, news.
LEADFEMALE:But then after the lecture you performed until 3 a.
SUPMALE:m.
SUPFEMALE:at the Comedy Cabaret.
LEADMALE:And now you're doing two shows tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Well, two reasons: See, I'm a performing addict.
OTHERMALE:I can't get enough of it.
OTHERMALE:Also the owner of the Comedy Cabaret is a friend of a cousin of a friend of a friend and so on and so on.
LEADMALE:- Well, I couldn't say no.
SUPMALE:- Gee, that's a great angle for my story.
SUPMALE:Robin Williams, the comedian who can't say no.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:My dinner flew away.
LEADFEMALE:You mind if I have some of your star munchies? Sure, why not? I was hoping you'd go for the trail mix.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe this man is actually grazing in front of me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, back to you.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry to avoid you.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know why I can't say no.
LEADMALE:I guess I want people to like me.
LEADMALE:I hate myself for that.
SUPMALE:But I used to be able to say no.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what do you mean? Well, before all this craziness started, my friends used to call up and go: ''Robin, come on.
LEADMALE:We're all going outside.
LEADMALE:There's some gnarly waves and we can hang out.
LEADFEMALE:'' And I have to go: ''No, my mama said I have to stay inside and read Nietzsche tonight.
LEADMALE:'' Later on, I guess I felt really afraid to say no to them because then they'd all say like: ''Oh, Robin Williams, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Smarty-Pants-Big-Shot, wow, you forgot your old friends.
OTHERMALE:You can't lend me $1 0,000 for a new car.
LEADMALE:You won't do the Save the Shrimp benefit.
SUPMALE:'' This is none of my business, but it seems like if they're really your friends, they'd understand.
LEADMALE:But it seems to me you can't say no to a total stranger.
LEADMALE:You're right.
OTHERMALE:It also looks like you're probably taken advantage of a lot.
SUPMALE:If you learned to say no, you'd probably have a lot more time to yourself.
LEADMALE:Maybe that's the last thing I want.
LEADFEMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:- Five minutes, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Williams.
LEADFEMALE:- Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't get much of an interview.
LEADMALE:I hope you're not disappointed.
LEADFEMALE:Disappointed, are you kidding? You're breaking her perky little heart.
OTHERMALE:Listen, if it means that much to you, tell you what I'm gonna do for you.
LEADMALE:I'll put off my flight.
SUPMALE:Tomorrow morning when my manager's asleep, I'll sneak down to the TV station and do an on camera interview with you.
SUPMALE:You'd do an on camera interview with me? Oh, I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:I was just supposed to write this up and let the anchorman read it.
LEADMALE:Oh, that is so nice.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:Oh, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:No, I can't do that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, that's kind of a bad time for me too.
SUPFEMALE:How about next July? No, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:We were just talking about how you can't say no.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna be another person just to take advantage of you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't worry about that.
SUPMALE:I'll learn to say no some other time.
LEADMALE:Come on, watch the show from the wings.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:One thing before you go.
OTHERFEMALE:Today I was chased by a mob who wanted to tear my clothes off.
SUPFEMALE:Is it because they say I look like you? Well, there's kind of a resemblance.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like you just went through Celebrity 1 A.
LEADMALE:How'd it feel? Oh, it was frightening.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you want to take a job where they tear your clothes and throw you? Well, actually, I became a performer by accident.
LEADFEMALE:My dad used to have this job where he had to move around a lot.
LEADMALE:Sometimes he'd leave the forwarding address.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he didn't do that.
SUPMALE:No, you're right.
SUPMALE:I was kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, he packed me in the crates with the dishes.
SUPFEMALE:What a guy, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, I was always being like the new kid in the neighbourhood.
SUPMALE:Well, since I was suffering from a case of the terminal shy, I couldn't make friends that easily.
SUPFEMALE:And I spent a lot of time in my room and I created my own little world, full of, like, all these little characters that had strange, unusual qualities.
SUPMALE:After a while, I realised people found these characters funny and outrageous.
LEADMALE:Then it got to the point where I realised that the characters could say and do things I was afraid to do myself.
SUPFEMALE:And after a little while, here I am.
LEADFEMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, Mr.
LEADMALE:Robin Williams.
LEADFEMALE:We're on.
LEADMALE:Take care.
SUPMALE:Wish me luck.
OTHERMALE:- Good luck.
LEADFEMALE:- Listen to that applause.
LEADFEMALE:Something like that might make torn clothes worthwhile, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Your Cinerama-ness.
LEADMALE:Just get on with your report, Mork.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:This week, sir, I learned what it's like to be famous on Earth.
SUPFEMALE:That's good.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't.
SUPMALE:You see, most Earthlings try very hard to be recognised for what they do, but when they become stars, sir, they realise they're recognised wherever they go.
OTHERMALE:you mean they lose their privacy? Well, sir, sometimes they can even lose their clothes.
OTHERMALE:You see, being a star, sir, is a 24-hour job and you can't leave your face at the office.
LEADFEMALE:lsn't fame its own reward? Oh, yes, sir, it is.
SUPFEMALE:When you're a celebrity, everybody wants a piece of you.
LEADMALE:Unless you can say no, there will be no pieces left for yourself.
LEADMALE:l thought all stars were rich, live in mansions and drive big eggs.
LEADFEMALE:I know, sir, that's the common misconception.
SUPFEMALE:But you see, to get that, you have to pay a very heavy price.
SUPFEMALE:You have responsibilities, anxieties.
LEADFEMALE:To be honest, sir, some of them can't take it.
OTHERMALE:- l'm not buying it, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Why, sir? lt sounds to me like they have it made.
SUPFEMALE:Well, most of them do, sir, but some are victims of their own fame.
LEADFEMALE:Very special and talented people.
LEADMALE:People like Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Lenny Bruce, Freddie Prinze and John Lennon
SUPMALE:
SUPMALE:Hey, come on, honey.
SUPMALE:Your plane leaves in an hour.
SUPFEMALE:All set.
SUPFEMALE:Except for Mork.
LEADMALE:I wonder why he ran out at the last minute like that.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey, Mork wouldn't miss seeing you off.
OTHERMALE:After all, going to Topeka is a big deal.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, covering the Winter Wheat Conference is a big deal.
LEADMALE:Who's gonna pick you up at the airport? A chartered tractor? No.
OTHERFEMALE:No, it's important, Dad, because Mr.
SUPMALE:Sternhagen at the station said if I do really good on this assignment, he might give me a bigger one.
LEADMALE:Like city hall, congressional scandals, maybe even the Summer Wheat Convention.
LEADMALE:Mind.
OTHERMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Pop, Pop.
LEADMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Pop, Pop, Pop.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind.
SUPMALE:Mind, Mind, Pop, Pop, Mind, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I brought you this wonderful gift.
SUPMALE:Since you're going to Kansas, I got a flea collar for Toto.
LEADMALE:Don't be afraid, there's no place like that.
OTHERMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, thank you.
LEADMALE:I'll pass it along.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, honey, I'll go warm up the car.
LEADMALE:You know, the best way to do that is to blow on its carburettor and say that you love it.
SUPMALE:I'll do that, but I'll hate myself in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Mork, now I want you to pay close attention.
LEADFEMALE:We've got a lot of things to cover if you're gonna manage by yourself.
LEADMALE:Come on, now, Mind, scoff, scoff, derisive laughter.
LEADFEMALE:Me manage by myself? Do you know who you're talking to? Yes.
SUPMALE:- This is the can opener.
SUPFEMALE:- Can opener.
LEADMALE:- This is the coffee pot.
LEADMALE:- Coffee pot.
LEADMALE:Remember what I told you about the blender? Yes, just turn it off.
LEADFEMALE:Don't just stand there waiting for it to flush.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:And remember the most important part.
LEADMALE:You turn it off from the outside.
OTHERMALE:I wondered why my fingernails were getting shorter.
SUPMALE:Well, I gotta run.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna miss you, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you can't miss, Mind, if you aim right here.
LEADMALE:Okay, well, you have a good time, and I'll see you when I get back on Monday.
LEADFEMALE:You have a good time.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about me.
SUPFEMALE:Everything's all right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a superior being - and I can handle everything.
OTHERMALE:- That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:Later, mama.
OTHERFEMALE:Alone again Just to be alone again Well.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess I'll just have to peel it and eat it raw.
LEADMALE:Oh, I've gotta stop thinking about her.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I've gotta stop thinking about her.
SUPMALE:No! Oh, she's not even thinking of me.
SUPFEMALE:She's here.
LEADFEMALE:She got my psychic telegram.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my darling.
LEADFEMALE:My darling.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what a disappointment.
SUPFEMALE:You're no aurora borealis yourself.
LEADMALE:I just came up to tell you, I got a call from our landlord, Mr.
LEADMALE:Klevins.
SUPMALE:He's coming around later to instal smoke alarms in all the apartments.
LEADFEMALE:No more smoke? There goes my chat with Chief White Eagle.
SUPMALE:What? You better get this place cleaned up.
LEADMALE:This Klevins is a real creep.
SUPMALE:He's bounced tenants for having crooked doormats.
LEADMALE:- You really miss Mindy, don't you? - No way.
LEADMALE:Well, where'd you get all the pictures? Shiksamat? What? Listen, maybe it'd help to get your mind off Mindy if you go out with some of your friends.
LEADFEMALE:That's be great, Bick.
LEADFEMALE:How about the two of us? Paint the town pink, huh? - I'm sorry, Mork, I can't.
LEADMALE:- Why not? Because it sounds like a drag.
SUPFEMALE:And I thought he didn't like me.
SUPFEMALE:Hear that, Mind? They're playing our song, darling.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I love it when you wear that perfume, Janitor in a Drum.
LEADFEMALE:You can cure that with some fabric softener.
LEADFEMALE:You know that, don't you? Wait a minute, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:That can only mean one thing.
LEADFEMALE:He's here.
LEADMALE:It's him.
SUPFEMALE:The Orkan Elder.
SUPMALE:What do you mean, no? It's the ancient one, the wisest of the wise.
SUPFEMALE:Stop that.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, quick.
LEADMALE:Down upon your knees.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice touch.
LEADFEMALE:- Rise, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be so formal, Mork.
LEADMALE:You know my name is: I came because it's my birthday.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sir, happy birthday.
LEADFEMALE:Birthday.
LEADMALE:Very touching.
SUPFEMALE:Hard to keep a dry eye.
LEADMALE:I just wish the Orkan aging process wasn't reversed.
LEADMALE:Seems like every day I look in the mirror, I get a little bit cuter.
LEADMALE:- Where does the time go? - I don't know, sir.
LEADMALE:Probably the same place that socks go when you lose them in the dryer.
LEADMALE:How old are you today, sir? In Earth years, 87.
LEADMALE:You know, that's amazing.
OTHERMALE:If you were a dog, you'd be 1 4.
LEADFEMALE:I decided to treat myself and drop in to see you.
SUPMALE:And, especially, the soft-lapped one.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm sorry about that, sir, but she's out of town.
LEADMALE:Sir.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry I missed her.
LEADMALE:They don't make laps like hers on Ork.
LEADMALE:Well, I can entertain you in the traditional Orkan fashion, sir, if you wish to come with me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Orkan checkers.
LEADMALE:- You go first, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Oh, thank you, sir, for the privilege.
SUPFEMALE:- Check.
SUPFEMALE:- Checkmate.
SUPMALE:And I never even saw it coming.
LEADFEMALE:That's why you're the Elder, sir.
LEADMALE:You know, I kept thinking about the two of you down here.
LEADMALE:Especially Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:She's different from us.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah? I know, sir.
LEADFEMALE:You know, sir, the last time you were here, you said you could build a Mindy.
SUPMALE:Can you? I suppose I could.
LEADMALE:I've got my genetic toolkit in the egg.
OTHERFEMALE:What will you do with the one I build you - when the real Mindy gets back? - I could sell her to the Osmonds in case Marie gets trampled at a family reunion.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you sure you only need one hair? You're gonna have to make her head - awfully small for this to fit.
SUPFEMALE:- Of course.
SUPMALE:Didn't you learn anything in your cloning class on Ork? I had to substitute basket weaving for cloning.
LEADMALE:I was on athletic scholarship.
LEADMALE:I need some information on Mindy's character traits.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's very easy, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:She talks like this.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, my name is Mindy, I'm a Capricorn.
LEADMALE:I like fuzzy things, happy people, solar energy, and whistling at construction workers.
OTHERMALE:Turnoffs are gas-guzzling cars, cancer-causing agents, nuclear power plants and bathroom poetry.
LEADFEMALE:If I wasn't so modest, I'd say I was adorable.
LEADMALE:Excellent.
LEADMALE:Now hand me the Kapovney clamp so I can adjust her lQ.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Please, sir, remember that she's quite intelligent, she has a degree, and she knows about everything.
SUPFEMALE:Watering plants, driving a jeep.
LEADFEMALE:She can tie her shoe without looking down.
SUPMALE:She's almost done.
OTHERMALE:Oh, sir, please remember she was wearing a pink sweater and jeans.
LEADMALE:And remember to put her nose right between her eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Sir? Oh, sir? Sir, she's ready, sir.
OTHERMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADFEMALE:I may be old, but I'm not deaf.
LEADMALE:Oh, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sir.
LEADMALE:- Sir, it worked.
LEADMALE:It's an exact duplicate.
LEADMALE:- Of course.
LEADFEMALE:Talk to her.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mind.
LEADMALE:Big kiss.
LEADMALE:If you think I'm going to flex my orbicular muscle to osculate, you're sadly mistaken.
LEADFEMALE:- What'd she say? - No.
SUPFEMALE:This idle discourse fatigues me.
OTHERMALE:But don't you remember? It's me, your cute little old Morkie.
LEADMALE:Enough of this childish drivel.
SUPFEMALE:I need mental stimulation.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you have any books to read? No.
LEADMALE:I have some to colour.
LEADMALE:Never mind, I'll write my own.
SUPMALE:But Mind.
LEADMALE:Call me when you've evolved.
SUPFEMALE:Sir, I think you made her a little too intelligent.
LEADMALE:- What happened? - Well, sir, meaning no disrespect, but I think you really orked up.
LEADMALE:Begging your pardon, sir, what was wrong with Mindy's clone? I mean, if we were gonna have a battle of wits, I'd be an unarmed man.
SUPMALE:These Earthlings must be more complex than I thought.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sir.
OTHERMALE:Don't give up.
LEADMALE:Please, try again.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I'm real lonely.
SUPFEMALE:Remember, sir, I mean, she's more the outdoor type.
SUPFEMALE:She's energetic and athletic.
LEADFEMALE:She's not a spectator, she's a doer.
OTHERFEMALE:This one will be right.
SUPMALE:An elder never fails, twice.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, bless you, sir, bless you.
SUPFEMALE:May your shoes always be loose.
LEADFEMALE:Tingling, sense of anticipation.
OTHERFEMALE:Sir? Sir? It's happening again, sir.
SUPFEMALE:I think we got a hot one, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:- Hi, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Big kiss.
LEADMALE:- Not now.
LEADMALE:I'm in training.
SUPFEMALE:That's real athletic and energetic, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:But how do you turn her off, though, sir? The deactivating button is on her foot.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, I'm not going near her without a whip and a chair.
LEADMALE:Come on, two out of three, two out of three.
SUPFEMALE:- Now it's your turn, Mind.
LEADMALE:- Come on.
LEADMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt, aunt.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, uncle, uncle, uncle.
LEADMALE:End of round one, neutral corners.
SUPMALE:Sir, can I borrow this? Sir, can you make the next one a little more loving and affectionate? One less turn on the butch bolt? - I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:I hope it's Gore Vidal come to borrow a cup of aphorisms.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no, no.
OTHERMALE:We can't let anybody see you.
LEADMALE:I opt to remain.
LEADFEMALE:I feel the need for social discourse on a much higher level.
LEADMALE:You have proved to me that Darwin was wrong.
SUPMALE:Pardon me, possibly we could find a harmonious resolution to this imbroglio by a conflict of intellects, i.
SUPFEMALE:e.
LEADFEMALE:, a battle of wits, whereby the loser must forfeit an article of clothing and reveal epidermis.
OTHERFEMALE:- A strip debate.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yes, if you catch my drift, yes.
SUPFEMALE:Very well.
LEADFEMALE:Let's discuss the Cartesian dictum: - ''I think, therefore I am.
LEADFEMALE:'' - Therefore.
SUPFEMALE:And how it relates to Kierkegaard's observation that a relation which relates itself to its own self must have been created by itself or created by another.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, fascinating.
SUPFEMALE:However, your possession of extraneous literature constitutes a foul.
LEADFEMALE:Therefore, please, remit to me your left pedal extremity, if you can.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you very much.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry about that, Mind.
SUPMALE:I mean, I'd have a very hard time explaining you.
LEADMALE:And you would have a very hard time explaining you.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:- Who is it? - It's me, Al Klevins, the landlord.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'll be right there, Mr.
LEADMALE:Klevins.
SUPMALE:All right, tidy up.
SUPMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Hi, you must be the creep.
LEADMALE:Creep? I don't know you and already I'm not liking you.
LEADFEMALE:Where's my tenant, Mindy McConnell? Oh, she's in Kansas right now, looking for a small dog at a midget convention.
LEADMALE:- Who are you? - Mork, the man who lights up her life.
LEADMALE:This place is a mess.
LEADFEMALE:I don't see how you can tell with all this junk lying around.
LEADFEMALE:I have no time for this chitchat.
OTHERFEMALE:I gotta instal this smoke alarm so that people like you won't light up my life.
SUPFEMALE:I'll put it here, in the bedroom over there.
OTHERMALE:Oh, if you ever hear this: Put out the fire, then leave.
OTHERMALE:- Round two.
LEADMALE:- Wait, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:That was a buzzer, not a bell.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna squeeze you like a tube of anchovy paste.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:You'll never take me alive.
LEADMALE:Sorry about that, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait, wait, I've got them coming and going here.
SUPMALE:Hold on a second.
LEADMALE:What are we doing, Rockette kicks? What? No time for learn yoga.
OTHERFEMALE:Wish I could get a deposit on all these empties.
LEADFEMALE:Well, hi there, hot stuff.
LEADMALE:Big kiss.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, Mind.
LEADMALE:I asked for somebody warm and more affectionate, not a human hickey maker.
LEADMALE:You're cute.
SUPFEMALE:Today, boy.
SUPMALE:Tonight, man.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, I'm a very kind, innocent little alien.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, please, I wanna wear white at my wedding.
LEADMALE:Why don't I slip into something more comfortable, like skin? No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:You can't go in there.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, try to stop me, blue eyes.
LEADMALE:By tonight, my darling, you'll be needing a lip retread.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling you, I'm going to drive you to China for Jewish food.
SUPFEMALE:I'm starting to get to you, huh? Quick.
LEADMALE:Fondle me with your eyes.
SUPFEMALE:Tell you what, let's sip champagne from your slipper, eh, ma petite? All right, my scruffy rogue.
LEADMALE:- Find it first.
LEADMALE:- Oh, I'll find it for you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, bingo.
OTHERFEMALE:I will sip from no slipper before its time.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, let's make it a double.
LEADFEMALE:At least I found her turnoff.
LEADFEMALE:Up she go.
LEADMALE:Make room for one more.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we're stacking up like cordwood in here.
LEADFEMALE:Would you stay calm? - Hey, you? - Hello.
LEADFEMALE:- What are you doing? - Oh, just tidying up.
SUPMALE:I saw what you did.
OTHERFEMALE:You put a person in there.
OTHERMALE:In fact, it looks like Miss McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:It's Ms.
OTHERFEMALE:McConnell to you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna call the police.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna call the police.
LEADFEMALE:- It's just an ostrich.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:- No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:You're a murderer.
LEADFEMALE:That's what you are.
OTHERFEMALE:No, please, you don't understand.
LEADMALE:Hello? Hello, operator.
SUPMALE:Get me the police.
SUPFEMALE:I want to report a murder.
SUPFEMALE:- No, you don't understand.
SUPMALE:- Hi, Mork.
LEADMALE:Never mind.
SUPFEMALE:It's not as important as I thought.
OTHERFEMALE:Miss McConnell, you're alive.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:So are you.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on here? Yeah, but you can't be here.
SUPMALE:I just saw him stuff your body into that closet.
LEADMALE:- Here, I'll show you.
LEADMALE:- No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:It's an ostrich convention.
LEADFEMALE:You don't wanna disturb them.
OTHERMALE:Look, I saw you put someone in there, and I'm gonna find out what's going on around here.
LEADMALE:All right! All right, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Smarty-Pants.
LEADFEMALE:You wanna know what's in there? - Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:- Okay.
SUPMALE:I'll show you what's in there.
LEADFEMALE:I'm opening the door.
OTHERMALE:I'm reaching in.
LEADFEMALE:It's just your typical mop with jeans and a sweater.
LEADMALE:A perfectly logical explanation.
SUPMALE:Sort of.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm getting out of here.
OTHERMALE:I can't-- I'm getting out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I'll move back to the Bronx, where it's safe.
SUPMALE:What is going on here? Why does this mop have my picture on it? - That's kind of hard to explain, Mind.
LEADMALE:- Oh, I'll bet.
SUPMALE:- Now, what's really in the armoire? - Mind, Mind, you don't wanna Mork, where'd you get the dead Mindys? They're not dead, Mind.
LEADMALE:It's just my personal pile of perkiness.
LEADMALE:- Don't touch their feet, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:- Touch their feet? I don't even wanna touch the armoire.
LEADMALE:What are they doing in there? - Well, the Elder made them, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- The Eld--? The Elder's here? - He's upstairs, cranking out more.
LEADMALE:- Oh, we gotta to stop him.
LEADFEMALE:Sir-- Sir, what's wrong? I'm a failure, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:An 87-year-old has-been.
SUPMALE:I tried to re-create a Mindy.
LEADMALE:I really tried.
SUPFEMALE:But all I could make were cheap imitations, Iike this one.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sir, this is her, this is the real McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:Please, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Please, Mork, don't humour me.
LEADMALE:Suddenly, I feel very old.
OTHERFEMALE:The soft-lapped one.
LEADMALE:It's really you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course it's me.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome to Earth.
LEADFEMALE:What are all those mes doing in the closet? Oh, Mind, don't blame him.
LEADFEMALE:I asked him to make them for me because I really missed you.
SUPMALE:Well, I missed you too, Mork, but that's a little strange.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, they look just like me.
SUPMALE:That's just on the outside, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:But that's not the part we really missed.
LEADMALE:I've learned a valuable lesson.
OTHERFEMALE:Humans aren't toys to tinker with.
OTHERFEMALE:Seeing you again is the best birthday present I could possibly have.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's your birthday? Oh, happy birthday.
LEADFEMALE:If I were only 30 bleams younger, then I'd still be too old for you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what about all the Mindys? Oh, I'll take them back to Ork for scientific study.
OTHERFEMALE:You can keep the one upstairs.
OTHERFEMALE:Upstairs? You mean there's another one up in the attic? Yes, except she didn't turn out exactly as I hoped.
LEADFEMALE:Let me introduce you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mindy? Mindy? Hi, Mork.
LEADMALE:Big kiss.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Your Jelly-Bellyness.
SUPFEMALE:You like that one, Beebs? Does that tickle your fancy? I've got a million of them.
SUPFEMALE:And l've heard them all, twice.
OTHERMALE:- Get to your report, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, yes, sir, Your Snippiness.
OTHERMALE:This week, sir, I've prepared a very, very special report for you.
SUPMALE:I finally found out what distinguishes one Earthling from another.
LEADMALE:Funny.
LEADFEMALE:They all look alike to me.
LEADFEMALE:That may be true, mein hippodrome, but every person has something that makes him unique and very special.
SUPMALE:- It's called a personality.
LEADFEMALE:- Could you show me one? Well, no, sir, it's not something you could see or touch.
LEADMALE:But it's something that reaches out and touches people.
SUPMALE:It makes each one of them very, very, very different.
LEADFEMALE:- Isn't that inefficient? - Oh, you bet, sir, but that's what makes life on this planet so darn interesting.
LEADFEMALE:You see, sir, thanks to personalities, even the most identical twin is not the same.
SUPFEMALE:Even the shortest person can stand out in a crowd.
LEADMALE:They may have the same number of chromosomes but each person has his own designer genes.
SUPMALE:Until next week, sir, na-no, na-no.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Can I talk to you guys about something personal? You got a tattoo.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's about Mork.
LEADMALE:Is he still lighting a candle every day in memory of Edith Bunker? Yes, but that's not the problem.
OTHERMALE:No, the problem is I met this guy through work and he asked me out to dinner and I don't know whether I should go or not.
LEADMALE:Well, what's the problem? You and Mork are just good friends.
SUPFEMALE:Well, yeah, we are, but we really haven't dated anyone in the last year.
LEADMALE:And it just kind of worked out that way.
LEADMALE:Well, then, live, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Grow, expand your soul.
LEADFEMALE:Humanity is the palette from which you colour your relationships.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I mean if you go out and meet new people, it can enrich and ennoble your attitudes towards each other.
LEADMALE:In other words, Mindy, fool around.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Glenda may be right.
SUPFEMALE:Meeting new people could be a lot of fun.
OTHERFEMALE:- For both you and Mork.
SUPMALE:- Really? - Yeah.
SUPMALE:- What good advice.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Now, you tell Mork.
LEADMALE:No, it's true.
SUPMALE:Mork should meet more people.
LEADMALE:I mean, after all, that's why he came to this planet.
LEADFEMALE:Place.
SUPMALE:Why he came to this place.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, gosh.
LEADMALE:Well, I hate to eat and run, but I have to burn off this cake.
LEADMALE:Come on, Jeanie.
LEADMALE:Oh, enjoy it, lips, before it winds up on hips.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, bye-bye.
LEADMALE:- Bye.
LEADMALE:Listen, if you end up going out with this guy, why don't you see if maybe he has a friend, you know, brother or cousin, nephew, uncle, grandfather? Bye.
LEADMALE:Mork, can I talk to you for a minute? Oh, sure, Mind, here I come.
OTHERMALE:Catch me.
OTHERMALE:Now I know who not to call in case of a fire.
LEADMALE:Here I am, Mind, preparing early for our usual Saturday evening television marathon.
LEADMALE:We're gonna boogie till the test pattern.
LEADFEMALE:Here we are.
SUPMALE:One regulation snuggle sack.
SUPMALE:My regulation snuggle sack.
LEADMALE:Also, hold on here.
LEADFEMALE:And the best surprise of all, a little bag of popcorn.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork.
SUPMALE:- Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:How would you feel if I told you I wasn't gonna watch television with you tonight? I'd say that Mork and Mindy have reached a new level of intimacy.
SUPMALE:I'll go upstairs, put on my see-through suspenders and we'll snap till dawn.
LEADMALE:No, what I mean is I'm not gonna be here tonight.
SUPMALE:- I have a date.
LEADMALE:- You? Yeah, me.
LEADFEMALE:No, I've been thinking about it and I think it'd be healthy for us to go out and meet other people.
LEADMALE:Well, Mind, have I stopped you from meeting other people? Well, no, but I haven't exactly helped you meet them, either.
LEADMALE:And I've been so busy trying to graduate from college and trying to find a job that we've sort of closed ourselves off in a cocoon.
SUPFEMALE:That's crazy, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I came to Earth to observe people.
OTHERFEMALE:You should be able to observe people too.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Oh, I'm so glad you feel that way.
SUPFEMALE:To tell you the truth, I was nervous about bringing the whole thing up.
SUPMALE:You kidding? This conversation has changed my life.
SUPMALE:I'm going out right now and break new ground, meet new people.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna get out there right now, Mind-- There's somebody right now.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you, fella.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you in the hardhat, why don't you come on up tonight? I've got an empty snuggle sack.
SUPMALE:It's open.
LEADMALE:- Hi, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Remo.
LEADMALE:Here's the pizza you ordered.
SUPMALE:It's your usual.
LEADMALE:Everything but tomato and cheese.
LEADMALE:Where's Mindy? Oh, she's out with some guy having her horizons expanded.
LEADMALE:- She's got a date? - Yes.
LEADMALE:She says with these experiences, she'll enrich her life, and we'll have something to share in our golden years.
LEADMALE:- You bought that? - Yeah, and the watch too.
LEADMALE:- Look, you're a single guy, all right? - Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:This is Saturday night.
LEADFEMALE:Get out the little black book.
LEADMALE:Oh, little black book.
LEADFEMALE:You mean Roots? No, that address book.
LEADMALE:Idiot moi.
LEADFEMALE:Why, look at this.
SUPMALE:You got a chick for every night of the week.
SUPMALE:''Lola, Stephanie, Marcy.
SUPFEMALE:'' - Give them a call.
OTHERMALE:- I can't.
LEADMALE:They're asleep right now.
LEADMALE:They're kids from the day-care centre.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you must know some women with their permanent teeth.
LEADMALE:Let's think.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, think of someone.
SUPMALE:Anyone, just give me a name.
LEADMALE:All right, well, there's your sister Jeanie.
LEADMALE:- I don't think so.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Glenda Faye.
OTHERMALE:Glenda Faye, that's perfect.
LEADFEMALE:She's single.
SUPMALE:She lives in one of those singles complexes.
LEADMALE:Give her a call.
LEADMALE:- Just relax, all right? - Okay.
SUPMALE:- Now just-- - What do I say to her? Say, ''What are you doing tonight, Glenda?'' And whatever you do, don't sound hard up or lonely.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:It's rang two times.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello? Glenda? Hi, it's me, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:That's all, it's just Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, hi.
SUPFEMALE:What am I doing? Well, whatever it is, I'm not hard up or lonely.
SUPFEMALE:Well, actually, right now I'm having a party with all of my friends.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, what are you doing? You're having a Japanese dinner party? That's wonderful.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure, I can come.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yes.
SUPMALE:Glenda, I have one question.
LEADMALE:When you eat sushi, do you eat with the fingers or do you eat the fingers separately? Come in.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi, Morky san.
OTHERFEMALE:- Hayakawa, Glenda Faye.
OTHERMALE:- These flowers are for you.
LEADMALE:- Oh, how sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, they're not, I tasted them.
LEADMALE:You are such a kidder.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, how about a little sake? Oh, make it two.
SUPMALE:One for each footy.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Mork, I'd like you to meet all my friends.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thus begins my growth experience.
OTHERMALE:Hey, everybody, this is Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:- Hi.
LEADFEMALE:That's that.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, all.
LEADFEMALE:I have a lot to share with Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:- Good night.
SUPMALE:- Get back here, sillikins.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:- Stay a while and just mingle a little.
LEADFEMALE:- Mingle? - Mingle.
LEADMALE:- You mean, like: Would you like to mingle? Sure, I'll try anything once.
SUPMALE:Are those bell-bottoms? Why? Are my cuffs ringing? Excuse me, I think we have to stop seeing each other.
SUPFEMALE:Party chatter, party chatter, party chatter.
LEADFEMALE:- Excuse me, are you on something? - Yes, this lovely plush pile carpet.
LEADMALE:I'll go over here and motivate.
LEADMALE:I wonder if I have flower breath.
OTHERMALE:Mork, are you having a nice time? I don't think your friends like me.
LEADMALE:I feel kind of out of place.
SUPMALE:I feel kind of like Nancy Reagan at a soul-food parlour.
LEADMALE:Just kind of loosen up a little.
LEADMALE:Tell a joke.
LEADMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:Okay, everybody, Mork is going to tell a joke.
SUPFEMALE:- He is such a funny man.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Mork.
LEADMALE:- I only know one joke, Glen.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, great, tell it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Glenda, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:No pressure.
LEADMALE:Well, you see, these two Venusians walk into a bar.
LEADFEMALE:And one Venusian says No, don't spoil it, you know the ending.
LEADMALE:One Venusian says: And the other Venusian says: And then the bartender says: ''I can't even drink the water.
SUPMALE:'' Oh, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Glenda, can I go sit in the other room with the coats? Oh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:It's all right, I can talk to a mink.
OTHERFEMALE:It'll be okay.
SUPFEMALE:You know, it's really hard meeting new people for the first time.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, hardly anybody fits in right away.
LEADFEMALE:Just do me a little favour and stay for a little while longer.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Glenda, I feel like a fur ball in the throat of life.
SUPMALE:There's this great guy coming over for dinner tonight and I want you to meet him.
OTHERMALE:Everybody loves him.
LEADFEMALE:He's the life of the party, a regular Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Fun.
LEADFEMALE:- You could really learn a lot from him.
LEADFEMALE:- He's more fun than Mister Rogers? Beni Hana.
OTHERFEMALE:Goldfish sushi.
OTHERMALE:Mork.
OTHERMALE:This is Todd Norman Taylor.
LEADMALE:My friends call me TNT because I'm a dynamite kind of guy.
LEADFEMALE:Go to it, TNT.
OTHERFEMALE:Relieve the tensions of the '80s.
LEADMALE:You're a crazy lady, you know? She's a crazy lady.
SUPMALE:- Hi, I'm Pepper.
OTHERFEMALE:- Whoa, what's shaking, Pepper? Let's sit and talk travel.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I've been to all 27 Club Meds.
LEADMALE:What a week that was.
LEADMALE:Talking travel with him.
LEADMALE:If they only knew where I came from.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi, handsome.
SUPMALE:- Oh, what's your name? - Sheri.
LEADMALE:- Sheri? Oh, what's cooking, Sheri? Would you hold it against me if I told you you had a great body? I'm on a roll.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me, Mr.
LEADMALE:Fun.
LEADMALE:May I talk to you? What the matter, guy? Run out of wallflower seeds? Excuse me, ladies.
LEADMALE:Hey, guy, lighten up.
LEADFEMALE:Party, party.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry, I'm just a I'm a loser.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a social misfit.
LEADMALE:You forgot ''dud.
OTHERMALE:'' Hey, I understand.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been washed up on Shy Beach before.
SUPFEMALE:I couldn't surf, I couldn't ski.
SUPMALE:I couldn't even ride a mechanical bull.
SUPMALE:Let's face it, I was a pretty shallow guy.
LEADMALE:What'd you do? Put my act together.
LEADFEMALE:Props, little wardrobe, but most important of all, style.
LEADFEMALE:What's style? - You see the way you're dressed? - Well, yes.
LEADFEMALE:That's not it.
OTHERMALE:Tell you what, guy.
LEADFEMALE:You stick with the master, and in no time, I'll make you just like me from top to bottom.
SUPMALE:I guess I got a good head start because my bottom looks like your top.
LEADMALE:So how's Mork been lately? Well, I haven't seen much of Mork lately.
LEADMALE:Seems I've unleashed a singles monster on Boulder.
SUPMALE:I thought that's kind of what you wanted.
SUPMALE:You're seeing new people, Mork's seeing new people.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but we sure aren't seeing much of each other.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I mean, come on, Mindy, he can't be busy every single minute.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Wait a minute, I wanna show you something.
LEADMALE:- Wait till you see this.
SUPMALE:- What is it? - Monday.
SUPMALE:- Monday.
LEADFEMALE:''Eight-twenty a.
OTHERMALE:m.
OTHERMALE:, breakfast.
SUPMALE:Ten-forty-eight a.
OTHERFEMALE:m.
SUPMALE:, comparative lip-gloss tasting.
OTHERMALE:Eleven-oh-six a.
LEADMALE:m.
LEADMALE:, co-ed mud wrestling.
LEADFEMALE:'' My goodness, he is busy every minute.
OTHERMALE:Oh, not again.
SUPMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:No, Nikki Sue, Mork isn't here right now.
LEADMALE:He's at the floating Jacuzzi backgammon tournament.
SUPFEMALE:What? No, no, no, the finals are at 6:34.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, bye.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, Mindy.
LEADMALE:- Well, maybe it's good for Mork.
SUPMALE:I mean, he's getting out, he's meeting people.
SUPFEMALE:- So why am I so bugged? - Because maybe you feel left out? Maybe I feel left out.
OTHERMALE:According to this, Mork is gonna be at Glenda's party tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:It starts at 8:41 .
LEADMALE:Why don't you meet him over there? You know, kind of check out the situation.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
OTHERMALE:I was invited too, along with the rest of Boulder.
LEADMALE:I wasn't really planning on going.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Now, you have got to be just a little bit curious to see old Mork in action, huh? Oh, yeah, I am.
LEADMALE:But if I go to that party and he says to me, ''Hi there, chicky baby, what's your sign?'' I'm gonna kick him in the big dipper.
SUPMALE:Anybody here? Glenda? Mork? Mind.
SUPMALE:How are you? Star-spangled surprise and amber waves of joy.
SUPMALE:Hollywood kiss.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Oh, lovely.
LEADMALE:- What an interesting party.
LEADFEMALE:- Yes.
OTHERMALE:- You having fun? - Oh, for sure, for sure.
SUPFEMALE:Does Norman Lear make great jets? Oh, Mindy, I'm so glad you could make it.
LEADMALE:Let me get you a drink.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you'd like to try the specialty of the house? Morkaritas? - Morkaritas? - Well, they're named after me, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:It's tequila and balogna.
LEADMALE:Mustard around the rim is optional.
SUPMALE:I think I'll just have a meatless drink.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, but I've gotta go mix and mingle now to look for that deep relationship like you wanted me to.
LEADFEMALE:We'll catch you later when the energy's right.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, how are you? Have you ever had deep feelings about velour? Hey, Hit Man, huddle time.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, we'll do lunch one day.
LEADFEMALE:We'll bag it and call each other.
LEADMALE:I've told you the secrets of the opposite gender.
LEADMALE:Now's the time to rub them tender.
LEADMALE:- We bad, we bad.
LEADFEMALE:- We bad, we bad.
LEADMALE:- Hit Man? - He's a hit with all the ladies.
SUPMALE:Maybe I will have a Morkarita.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, you're not upset with me because I introduced Mork to all my friends, are you? Oh, no, of course not.
SUPMALE:Well, look at him.
LEADMALE:He's having such a good time.
LEADFEMALE:You know, chicky-boo, my sixth sense tells me that we've met in a previous life.
LEADMALE:You were Cleopatra and I was Richard Burton.
SUPFEMALE:You know, chicklet, I have seven cents that says we met, like, in a previous life.
LEADMALE:And you were Lady Godiva and I was Mister Ed.
LEADFEMALE:One day we'll go to Nautilus Centre and hold our breath.
OTHERMALE:Hey, baby, how'd you like to go up to my place for a nightcap? Hey, sweetheart, how'd you like to go over to my place for a night crawler? - I live at your place.
LEADMALE:- Oh, wow, Xanadu.
OTHERMALE:I've got a live one.
SUPFEMALE:We bad.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Why do I feel like I should be wearing abutton? Hi, I couldn't help overhearing because I was listening, but are you and the Hit Man living together? Oh, yeah, but it's not what you think.
SUPMALE:Oh, you'll have to tell me.
LEADMALE:I'm not into thinking.
OTHERMALE:You see, he and I are just friends.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, friends.
LEADMALE:In that case, Hit Man? I think she likes me, Mind.
LEADMALE:Isn't she nice? For sure, for sure.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't she? Isn't she really gnarly? You know, Mork, maybe it's time I got into the swing of things.
LEADFEMALE:Do you mind if I mix with your friends? - Oh, sure, Mind, go for it.
SUPFEMALE:- Will you hold this? Thanks.
SUPMALE:Hey, TNT, wanna have a megaton of fun? Hey, baby, I'm here for the taking.
SUPMALE:You get the Jell-O, I'll bring the birdcage.
LEADMALE:Mind, what are you doing? Just trying to mix and mingle because I'm single.
SUPFEMALE:- Party's moving to my place.
SUPFEMALE:- Party's at Pepper's.
LEADFEMALE:Wouldn't you like to be at Pepper's too? Hey.
LEADMALE:Come on, foxy.
OTHERMALE:Jump on the Silver Streak to singledom.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:You can be the caboose if you can get loose.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think we're on the same track, jack.
OTHERMALE:After this commercial message, we'll be back with Night Owl Theatre.
LEADMALE:Hey, crazy lady.
LEADMALE:Hey, Hit Man, you're home early.
LEADFEMALE:It's only 4:1 5.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Mind, you wanna know why I came home from roaming? You had to change for the predawn donut dunk.
LEADMALE:No, I saw that you left the party and I came to bring you back.
OTHERMALE:- Why did you leave, Mind? - I wasn't in the mood for a big party.
LEADMALE:But it looks like you're having a good time with all your new friends, especially that girl Pepper.
SUPMALE:Pepper? - Yeah, the girl who kissed you.
LEADMALE:- Oh, a lot of girls kissed me, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I guess they're just load-testing their lips.
SUPFEMALE:This is the first time we've sat together on this couch in over a week.
SUPMALE:Yeah, it feels pretty good.
SUPMALE:Mork, I'm glad you found a way of life you can really enjoy.
LEADFEMALE:Are you happy? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it makes me happy to make you happy.
LEADFEMALE:And you wanted me to meet new people.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but not as a career.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I thought making new friends would help us grow together, not grow apart.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Mind, I really missed you.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna be your cuddly little caterpillar, not somebody's social butterfly.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, that's so nice.
SUPMALE:Well, I'd rather be your cuddly caterpillar too.
SUPMALE:I realised that the first time I walked in Glenda Faye's building.
LEADMALE:You know, I like making new friends, but you're my best friend.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, I needed to hear that.
SUPFEMALE:- Yeah, me too.
LEADFEMALE:You know what's really nice? It's nice having you talking to me rather than at me.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's really great to make new friends, but don't forget who you are in the meantime.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, I promise.
LEADMALE:I'll just be my little old bozo self.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, one thing.
OTHERFEMALE:Can I keep the new friends I made? - Sure, they're fun.
LEADMALE:- Oh, really? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:- You hear that? She likes you.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, O jumbo jet setter.
LEADMALE:- Please, Mork, no fat jokes tonight.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
LEADMALE:Beebs is my best audience, sir.
LEADMALE:He's kind of like my George Jessel.
SUPFEMALE:What a lovely thing this ball of fur can be.
LEADFEMALE:- y our report, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:This week I've been running with Earthlings who have no mates, sir.
LEADFEMALE:- We like to call them ''singles.
LEADFEMALE:'' - y ou mean you left your Earthling? Oh, sir, bite your tongue, hush your puppies.
OTHERFEMALE:No, sir, actually, we just met other Earthlings, well, to enrich our own relationship, sir, and now, sir, we're closer than ever, if you know what I mean.
OTHERMALE:lnteresting concept, Mork.
LEADMALE:On Earth, you can be separate and still be together.
LEADFEMALE:Yes siree-do-da, sir.
SUPMALE:Sir, the most amazing thing is I found out that it's no fun to be single alone.
SUPFEMALE:I guess that's why all those singles flock together.
LEADFEMALE:Until next week, sir, na-no, na-no.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:''Well, Grandma, that about wraps things up here.
LEADMALE:Mork is fine.
LEADMALE:'' I should say Mork is Mork.
SUPMALE:You never know what he's gonna do next.
SUPMALE:- It's terrible.
LEADFEMALE:- But I think I'm about to find out.
LEADFEMALE:Mind.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, it's so terrible.
SUPMALE:Mind, I can hold my breath until I turn chartreuse.
LEADFEMALE:''Blue,'' Mork.
LEADMALE:Hold your breath until you turn ''blue.
SUPMALE:'' No, we Orkans hold our breath until we turn chartreuse just before we reach critical mass and explode, Iike Scanners? Well, please don't explode.
LEADMALE:I just vacuumed.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, what are you so upset about? All right.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I met these two singers named Rick and Ruby.
SUPMALE:And they drove all the way out here from Akron.
SUPFEMALE:And then they got out here and then the guy that hired them fired them just because Ruby's rabbit died seven months ago.
LEADMALE:What? Wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:They fired her because she's pregnant? Really? Who'd do such an insensitive sexist thing like that? Remo.
OTHERFEMALE:That explains it.
LEADFEMALE:Since when has Remo had entertainment at the restaurant? Oh, I don't know, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:I guess he wants to try and improve business somehow.
SUPFEMALE:But they came and he fired them, and now they don't have any money, they don't have any place to live, no place to go.
LEADMALE:- You mean they're stranded? - Oh, yes.
SUPMALE:Oh, God, no wonder you're so upset.
OTHERFEMALE:That makes me mad.
OTHERMALE:I mean, so what if she's pregnant? If a woman can work, she should be allowed to work.
OTHERMALE:You wouldn't turn someone like that out in the street, would you? Of course not.
LEADMALE:- What? - No way would I turn them out.
SUPMALE:She says it's okay, come on in.
LEADFEMALE:- Mind, meet Rick and Ruby.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi.
SUPFEMALE:We're sure glad you're taking us in.
SUPFEMALE:- Well - It's really nice of you.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we're total strangers and everything.
SUPFEMALE:For all you knew, we could have been a couple of real ding-dongs.
SUPFEMALE:- I guess I just lucked out.
SUPMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Or even worse, we could have been robbers or axe murderers or game-show hosts or something.
OTHERFEMALE:To tell you the truth, we're not really all that trustworthy even ourselves.
SUPMALE:We're not sure this baby is mine.
SUPMALE:Ricky, would you give me a little hand with this, you think? - Sure, honey.
SUPMALE:- It's so heavy.
SUPMALE:Thanks a million.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, anytime, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Why don't we go take a nap? I'm beat.
LEADMALE:Let me show you to your room.
LEADFEMALE:- This way, please.
LEADMALE:- Sure.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, pardon me, pardon me.
LEADFEMALE:- It's right in there.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, that's my bedroom.
LEADMALE:I know, Mind, but they both can't sleep on the couch.
OTHERMALE:Ruby will sleep on the couch and you can Rick can-- - The bedroom's right through there.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't you worry.
LEADMALE:The next three months are just gonna fly right by.
LEADFEMALE:Three months? It's gonna be so much fun.
SUPMALE:You know, sharing beauty hints and stuff.
LEADMALE:I just think it's so great to live in a country where you can actually have hair like this and still be allowed to reproduce.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm telling you that not hiring Ruby because she's pregnant is sexist.
OTHERMALE:And I'm telling you the only reason you're saying that is because you're a woman.
LEADMALE:- That remark is sexist.
LEADFEMALE:- I'm not a sexist.
LEADMALE:I'm a man.
LEADFEMALE:Jeanie, get over here.
LEADMALE:Get some water on Table 8, would you? Go stuff your manicotti.
SUPFEMALE:Even she's down on me.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what's going on here.
LEADMALE:Look, my dad taught me that pregnant women should be taken care of.
LEADFEMALE:They shouldn't work.
OTHERMALE:I respect women.
LEADFEMALE:If you respect women so much, why don't you let Ruby make the choice? I'm telling you, Remo, you are a real chauvinist.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, Remo, you're a real chauvinist.
LEADMALE:What do we mean by that, Mind? Well, in Remo's case, it's a general attitude that women are inferior.
SUPFEMALE:- Yeah? - Well, they aren't.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know that, Mind.
SUPMALE:I mean, they sew better, they cook better, they clean better.
OTHERMALE:- I'll talk to you about this later.
LEADMALE:- Okay.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Remo has always been like this.
SUPMALE:Whenever we played king of the hill, he was always the king.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:- I was always the hill.
SUPMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:Sexist.
LEADMALE:- I understand what's going on here.
LEADMALE:- Oh, good.
LEADMALE:Now, Remo, imagine what the worst thing that could possibly happen.
LEADFEMALE:Let's say you hire Ruby and the little lady's up there singing on-stage and all of a sudden, she hits a high note, and we all realise that she's not singing.
SUPFEMALE:That couldn't happen because she's seven months pregnant.
LEADMALE:Even if she does give birth on-stage, do you realise how many people would pay to come see her do that again? Mork, listen, I don't think pregnant women should work.
LEADFEMALE:That's the way I feel about it.
LEADMALE:I'm the one that has to live with it, and that is that.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, that is that? - That's it.
OTHERMALE:Well, Remo, I'm sure there are a lot of women's groups around Boulder who'd love to hear about the way you feel.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna make phone calls.
LEADFEMALE:I bet you you'll have a picket line outside your restaurant.
OTHERMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:That's your right.
LEADFEMALE:Just make sure none of them are pregnant.
LEADMALE:- What a chauvinist thing to say.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'll get a couple of men's groups together and we'll be out there tomorrow with you.
LEADMALE:Well, you can cheer us on from the sidelines and keep us supplied with coffee and those little sissy sandwiches.
SUPMALE:Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
SUPMALE:Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
SUPFEMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:They got half the town out here.
LEADFEMALE:Even Thelma Jenkins.
SUPFEMALE:I got a date with her tonight.
LEADMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Dinner and a cold shower again.
SUPMALE:You wanna get rid of the pickets? You hire Rick and Ruby.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not gonna hire a helpless pregnant woman.
LEADMALE:I'm standing on principle here.
LEADFEMALE:Remo, you're 27 years old.
LEADMALE:Why start now? Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
LEADFEMALE:Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
LEADMALE:Don't-- Lunch break.
LEADMALE:Boy, am I hungry.
OTHERMALE:I'd like three burritos and lots of ice cream.
LEADMALE:Well, at least we have one customer.
LEADFEMALE:Jeanie, would you? Sorry, but I'm on my lunch break too.
LEADMALE:I'll see you in an hour.
SUPFEMALE:Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
OTHERMALE:Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
LEADFEMALE:My own sister? You know, I could be mad at that Mindy.
LEADMALE:Why, if she's just doing what she thinks is right? And here comes the cause of my problem.
SUPMALE:What are you doing on your feet walking around? Will you sit down? Mork, what are you doing? We're picketing this place so people don't eat here.
LEADFEMALE:You crossed the picket line.
LEADMALE:If you chicks had made those sandwiches, I wouldn't be so fammed out right now for sure.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm pretty hungry too.
SUPFEMALE:I'll have whatever he's having, okay? I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:We're all out of burritos and ice cream.
LEADMALE:Rats.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe this.
SUPFEMALE:I don't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we invite the whole picket line in here? Okay, but everybody's gonna have to go Dutch.
SUPMALE:Mindy, come on, let's get together on this thing, huh? All right.
SUPMALE:Mork, you've heard their side, but you haven't heard mine.
LEADMALE:- Now, try and be objective, all right? - Kay-o.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:By the way, where's Rick? He's home asleep.
SUPMALE:He said this whole thing was my fault so I should be the one to picket.
SUPMALE:Sounds fair to me.
OTHERMALE:No, it doesn't.
OTHERFEMALE:None of this is fair.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, besides my feelings, this is a business.
SUPFEMALE:No one's gonna pay good money to see someone in her condition sing.
SUPMALE:- He's got a point, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- No, he doesn't.
LEADMALE:Her condition has nothing to do with her ability to sing.
LEADMALE:She's got a point, Remo.
LEADMALE:Mork, I mean, besides risking losing my customers, I have to pay them a salary.
LEADMALE:If Mindy were in my place, she wouldn't do it.
SUPMALE:- Would you pay them? - Of course.
LEADMALE:- She said she'd pay them a salary.
SUPMALE:- She's on.
LEADFEMALE:What? Hey, wait a minute, I didn't say-- I knew you'd do the right thing, you're always on the side of the right.
LEADFEMALE:- No, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:- Thanks, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:We could really use the money.
LEADFEMALE:Hold it.
OTHERMALE:What I meant-- Mind, you're not going back on your word.
LEADMALE:You're not going to be a shiksa giver, are you? No, no.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Okay, I'll make a deal with you, Remo.
SUPMALE:If they chase away customers, I'll pay their salary and if they don't, you pay it.
LEADMALE:- Okay.
LEADFEMALE:You got it.
LEADFEMALE:- Okay.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:- That's it.
LEADMALE:- It's not a big deal.
LEADFEMALE:- No.
OTHERFEMALE:- After all, this isn't exactly Vegas.
SUPMALE:I mean, how much could it be? - How much do they make? - Five hundred a week.
LEADFEMALE:Five hundred? Five hundred.
LEADFEMALE:So? It's okay.
LEADMALE:It's all right, Remo, because in the end, talent will out.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna talk to you about their talent.
OTHERMALE:Do you know the name of their group? - No.
LEADMALE:- Ask her.
OTHERMALE:Ruby, - what do you call your group? - The Stupids.
LEADFEMALE:The what? The Stupids.
LEADMALE:See, what we do is we get up on-stage and we act like we're real dumb.
LEADMALE:It's real hard too.
LEADMALE:If you think that being stupid is easy, you really ought to try it sometime.
LEADMALE:Besides being stupid, what else do you do? We sing songs that no one wants to hear.
SUPFEMALE:Don't most performers sing songs that people wanna hear? Oh, well, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:They do if they're smart.
SUPMALE:But we're The Stupids, see? Why aren't Rick and Ruby on the stage? Well, I think they're in the kitchen changing, Mind.
LEADMALE:You're not gonna believe this.
LEADMALE:Rick and Ruby are back there arm wrestling.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, no.
LEADMALE:- Arm wrestling? That's unfair.
LEADFEMALE:It's two against one.
LEADFEMALE:They got into an argument over what to call the baby and the winner gets to pick the name.
LEADMALE:Okay, I'm ready to go.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me tell you something, baby.
LEADFEMALE:You may be strong, but I got it up here.
LEADMALE:God, what are all these people doing here? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:The food must be pretty good, huh? Let me tell you something else.
OTHERFEMALE:No matter how many times you pin me, we're not gonna name the baby Trigger.
SUPFEMALE:It's a good name.
LEADFEMALE:It works for either a boy or a girl.
SUPMALE:If you guys are late one more time, I'm taking the waggon and going back to Akron.
SUPMALE:Now, do you want me to introduce you or not? Well, of course, Raoul.
OTHERMALE:Guy thinks we're stupid or something.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Is it okay if we play a little flamingo guitar? Ladies and gentlemen, The Stupids.
LEADMALE:The name was their idea.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:One, two, three-- Wait, I have an idea.
SUPMALE:Why don't we just sort of take a vote and let these people decide what to name the baby? No way, jose.
LEADMALE:We're in Colorado.
LEADMALE:These people will go for Trigger.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, but I'm not paying you to bicker.
OTHERMALE:In fact, I may not be the one that pays you at all.
SUPFEMALE:Just sing.
LEADMALE:God, we gotta tell him how to run his restaurant.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, one, two, three-- I really am sorry.
LEADMALE:You know, my mind just keeps wandering and that's not so bad, but then it comes back again and I'm sort of stuck with it.
LEADFEMALE:One, two, three, four.
SUPFEMALE:When you were a young boy Did you have a puppy That always followed you around? Well, l'm gonna be as faithful As a puppy l'm never gonna let you down 'Cause it gets higher Higher than a mountain goes lt gets harder, heaven knows - Do l love you, my, oh, my - My, oh, my - River deep, mountain high - River deep, mountain high - y eah, yeah, yeah - y eah, yeah, yeah - lf l lost you, would l cry? - lf l lost you, would l cry? - Oh, l love you, baby - Oh, l love you, baby - Baby, baby, baby - Baby, baby, baby l love you, baby Like a robin loves to sing l love you, baby Like the flower grows in spring l love you, baby Like a schoolboy loves his pie And l love you, baby River deep, mountain high - Do l love you, my, oh, my - Do l love you, my, oh, my - River deep, mountain high - River deep, mountain high - y eah, yeah, yeah - y eah, yeah, yeah - lf l lost you would, l cry? - lf l lost you would, l cry? - Oh, l love you, baby - Oh, l love you, baby - Baby, baby, baby - Baby, baby, baby That was terrific.
LEADMALE:That was just great.
SUPMALE:I gotta admit it, I was wrong.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot, Remo.
SUPMALE:I have a small announcement.
LEADFEMALE:I'm having a baby.
LEADFEMALE:Ruby, these people may be hicks, but even they can see you're gonna have a baby.
OTHERMALE:No, no, you don't understand.
LEADMALE:I'm having a baby now.
SUPFEMALE:- Now? - Sorry.
OTHERMALE:Just my luck.
SUPFEMALE:My first full house, it's 2-cent beer night.
OTHERFEMALE:I got a lead singer dogging it in the hospital with a little bundle of bliss named Trigger.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think spending the day in the hospital because you've had a baby is exactly dogging it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she lied to me.
LEADFEMALE:Told me she was seven months pregnant.
OTHERFEMALE:Turns out she was nine months.
LEADMALE:She started counting when she found out she was pregnant.
LEADMALE:Anyone could make that mistake.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know whose fault it is.
SUPFEMALE:I just know I need a singer.
SUPMALE:I can do it.
SUPFEMALE:I sing all the time in the shower, even upside down.
SUPMALE:Thanks, but I need more than a singer who performs in the shower.
LEADFEMALE:I sing in the bathtub, but it sounds different.
LEADMALE:It's more like: Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:What's wrong with us? - Ruby can't perform.
OTHERFEMALE:- Well, so what? I sing.
SUPMALE:Raoul sings.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:She's the only one I ever heard sing.
LEADMALE:I can sing.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna be a star.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, Fats Domino, move over.
LEADFEMALE:All I need is six guys to help me to move Fats over.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, let me handle this.
LEADMALE:Now, Ruby's a pretty lady and a wonderful singer, but let's get something straight.
SUPMALE:I'm the talent of the group.
SUPMALE:So just introduce us, okay? I don't know if I trust a guy who plays a pink guitar with a beak.

OTHERMALE:I'm going: Shouldn't there be something betweenand? Well, yeah, but that's Ruby's part, but she just had a baby.
LEADMALE:What are you, stupid? I knew this wasn't gonna work.
LEADFEMALE:Folks, we don't have a lead singer, so maybe we ought to just close up for tonight, huh? Wait, I can sing.
LEADMALE:I can sing, Mr.
SUPMALE:DaVinci.
LEADMALE:- Let me try it, please.

LEADFEMALE:You have never sung in front of an audience before.
SUPFEMALE:What do you call a rubber duck and a washcloth, chopped liver? - Now, come on.
LEADMALE:- Mork.
LEADMALE:I don't know about this.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not used to working with amateurs.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know about it, either, but yourain't selling diddly.
LEADMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not responsible for this.

LEADMALE:And a one and a two and a three.
LEADMALE:Roll on Roll on, roll on I'm really sorry, I don't know the words to that one.
LEADMALE:- What song do you know? - Well, all the way through? That would be nice.
LEADFEMALE:Then we could all finish together.
LEADFEMALE:Well Well, I know this one, ''This Heart is Closed for Alterations''? Wow, I can't believe it.
OTHERMALE:That's our theme song.
OTHERFEMALE:Here.
SUPFEMALE:Here's Ruby's hat.

SUPMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Jack Prude, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Jack Prude, thank you all.
LEADMALE:Oh, bless you, bless you.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I never dreamed that you knew how to sing like that.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you got in front of all these people you never met before, and cool as a cucumber, you just sang your heart out.
LEADFEMALE:- Talk about nerves of steel.
SUPMALE:- Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Glad we finally understood each other.
SUPMALE:I have a little question I'd like to ask.
LEADMALE:What's it mean when your legs get kind of weak and you feel queasy and you kind of black out? It sounds like you're gonna faint.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, good, because I thought I was gonna have a baby.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Your Big Daddyship.
LEADFEMALE:l hear you, Mork.
SUPMALE:Why the cigar? Well, sir, I have reason to be proud, Your Stogieness.
SUPMALE:This week, I helped an Earthling get a job.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, isn't that nice there? - Congrats and huzzah, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Oh, thank you, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm especially proud, sir, since this Earthling was being discriminated against.
LEADMALE:She was, as they say on Ork, with test tube.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:- Yep.
SUPMALE:Earth pregnancy.
LEADMALE:- y ou explained it to me once.
LEADFEMALE:- Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Starts with the birds and the bees.
SUPFEMALE:Ends with pickles and ice cream.
LEADMALE:- One moment, Mork.
SUPMALE:- Sir? Are you saying Earthlings can't work in that enlarged condition? Oh, of course they can, sir.
LEADFEMALE:It never stopped you.
LEADFEMALE:l wouldn't know.
LEADMALE:l'm not pregnant.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on now, sir.
SUPMALE:Come on now.
LEADMALE:You could be about to hatch an entire village.
LEADMALE:- Get on with it, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Yes, indeed-do-dah.
OTHERMALE:Basically, I realised that the expectant mother knows what's best for her.
LEADMALE:Sounds reasonable.
OTHERFEMALE:lt is her pregnancy.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you won the magic prize, Your Perceptive Pudginess.
SUPMALE:You see, most Earthlings think that this is the end of a woman's career, when actually, it's just a pregnant pause.
OTHERFEMALE:Until next week, sir, na-no, na-no.
LEADFEMALE:Say good night, Bebo.
LEADMALE:That's close.
SUPFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mindy, dinner was delicious.
LEADFEMALE:Since Kathy's away, I'm grateful for any meal that doesn't begin with the word ''instant.
LEADMALE:'' You certainly are in a good mood today considering Uncle Dave is coming into town tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, we never got along very well.
LEADFEMALE:It's just, well, he's always accomplished more than I did and he let me know about it.
SUPFEMALE:He's always been a little eccentric.
LEADMALE:Is that why every time you see him, you break out in hives? Yeah, maybe this time it will be different.
LEADMALE:After all, it's been seven years since I've seen him.
SUPMALE:And he reminded me of his island in the Caribbean.
OTHERFEMALE:And my mortgage in Boulder.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you can stop scratching, Dad.
LEADMALE:I'll make him a great dinner and tell Mork not to cut his meat with his finger.
LEADFEMALE:Am I home yet, Mind? Yes, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, thank goodness.
OTHERFEMALE:This is the sixth house I've backed into.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I'll ask.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, why are you walking backwards? What? I'm celebrating my heritage, Mind, this is National Backwards Day.
SUPFEMALE:It something that everyone looks forward to on Ork.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm in big trouble.
LEADMALE:Oh, Pops, nice not seeing you.
LEADFEMALE:So you've been out walking around all day backwards.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't people stare at you? I don't know, Mind, I don't have eyes in the back of my head.
LEADMALE:Well, I have to go.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, just make sure you turn him around by the time Dave gets here.
LEADMALE:Oh, Pops, don't start scratching yet.
SUPFEMALE:That holiday's not until next month.
LEADFEMALE:So, Mork, how long does National Backwards Day last? - In Earth years, Mind? - Mork It's over, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, who's Dave? Oh, Dave is Dad's brother.
OTHERFEMALE:Pop has a biological brother? Is he older, younger, male, female? Well, he's older.
SUPMALE:And brothers are almost usually always male.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, not Dr.
SUPMALE:Joyce Brothers.
OTHERMALE:It's been years since we've seen Uncle Dave and Aunt Caroline.
LEADMALE:Dad really wants to impress his brother, so please try to act like an earthling.
SUPFEMALE:You got it, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Who do you want me to be? Catchy tune.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's here, it's my package from Ork.
LEADMALE:I ordered it special delivery.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, and no tip.
SUPMALE:You were slow opening.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind.
LEADMALE:- What--? - Ceremonial food for Backwards Day.
SUPFEMALE:- What is it? - It's called flek.
SUPMALE:- Flek? What's that? It's like nargle, except when you eat it, you don't grow feathers.
LEADMALE:It sure doesn't look like food.
LEADFEMALE:Well, these are seeds, Mind.
LEADMALE:You just plant them and up comes flek.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:There, little one And time and growth will know Mork, on Ork, do all plants grow that fast? Yes, Mindy, but on Ork, even the begonias have stretch marks.
SUPMALE:- Hello, Caroline.
SUPFEMALE:- Fred, dear, how nice to see you.
SUPMALE:Hi, Aunt Caroline.
LEADMALE:- And this can't be Mindy.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
SUPMALE:Oh, my, what a big girl you've grown up to be.
SUPMALE:So where's that big brother of mine? Oh, Dave, dear, Fred and Mindy are here.
LEADMALE:Oh, he just can't wait to see you.
LEADMALE:Junior, as I make it, you're four minutes late.
OTHERFEMALE:I've bought companies in less time.
LEADFEMALE:Well, yes, I know, Dave, but it's wonderful to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:This is Mindy, of course.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:What a pretty little girl you are.
LEADFEMALE:The outfit's a little strange.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know about the sweater.
SUPMALE:Doesn't make any difference, doesn't matter.
LEADFEMALE:- Uncle Dave, well, it's nice to see you.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, good.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll save those.
LEADMALE:Well, now you just move your little Adidas into the kitchen and let's get some goodies, huh? Yes, Daddy dear.
SUPMALE:Oh, I don't know what I'd do without her.
SUPFEMALE:I think I'll keep her.
SUPMALE:Tell me something, junior, where's your ball and chain? - My what? - I think he means your little wifey.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, well, Kathy's in Chicago this weekend.
LEADFEMALE:You let her travel? By herself? Oh, she plays flute in a chamber group.
LEADMALE:How fascinating.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:No, they're very good.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, junior.
SUPMALE:You're kidding me.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you got your wife playing the flute in Chicago, putting a stick in her face? You can't cut it on your own? Hey, tell me something incidentally, how's the arm? It itches.
LEADMALE:I mean, you're the maestro, the guy with the baton.
SUPFEMALE:How about a little building up of the biceps? Oh, well, no, no, Dave, come on.
LEADMALE:I think we're a little old for all of this, don't you? What do you mean, ''a little old,'' junior? Oh, no, no, you're never too old for the taste of victory.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right.
SUPMALE:Here we go, okay? Okay? One more for me.
SUPMALE:Now you have a real disadvantage.
OTHERMALE:Okay, all right, ready? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Dave McConnell here.
SUPFEMALE:About what? You want me to speak to the Boulder Association? - Uncle Dave.
SUPMALE:- Oh, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:I thought you and Aunt Caroline were having dinner at my house tonight.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's right, but what time are we eating, sweetheart? Seven-thirty? Seven-thirty.
SUPFEMALE:Seven-thirty.
LEADMALE:Listen, how about 9? Okay, boys? I'll be there.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see, where was I? Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess some things never change.
LEADFEMALE:Wrong, junior.
LEADMALE:No, this time you didn't cry for Mommy.
LEADMALE:Let's take a look at it.
LEADMALE:This smells good.
SUPFEMALE:That's good.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, how do my pants look? - Mork, very nice.
LEADFEMALE:- I pressed them myself.
SUPMALE:Do you think I'd get a better crease if I take them off first? Possibly.
SUPMALE:Mork, could you help me finish setting the table? - All right.
OTHERFEMALE:- Uncle Dave is in a hurry.
OTHERMALE:He wants to eat as soon as he gets here.
SUPMALE:Well, maybe we should start out by serving frog's arms.
OTHERFEMALE:We're not serving frog's arms.
LEADMALE:See, we're already ahead of schedule.
LEADMALE:I don't know why we're going to all this trouble for Uncle Dave.
OTHERMALE:I mean, he hasn't been very nice to Dad.
LEADMALE:I'm making this big meal and you made this delicious dessert.
SUPFEMALE:By delicious, Mind, are you inferring that some of this has passed by your lips? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It's good.
SUPMALE:Mind, that was flek.
SUPMALE:- Flek? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:- No earthling's ever eaten it.
LEADFEMALE:- I'm gonna be all right, aren't I? Just be calm and tell me where you keep your stomach pump.
LEADFEMALE:Stomach pump? I didn't mean to frighten you.
LEADMALE:We'll have to use the plunger.
LEADMALE:Open.
LEADMALE:- Mork, come on.
LEADFEMALE:- Mind, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:You're overreacting.
LEADFEMALE:I just ate a tiny piece and I feel fine.
SUPMALE:Oh, will you sign a statement to that effect, Mind? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:I guess if it's okay for Orkans, it's all right for you.
SUPMALE:There's nothing wrong with me that getting through this evening won't cure.
SUPMALE:I'll get it.
LEADMALE:I wonder if Uncle Dave would mind if I tied her to a chair.
SUPMALE:Mork, what did I just do? Something like this: It must be the flek, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:But I feel perfectly normal right now.
SUPMALE:Mindy, it's Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Mork, if I start acting strange again, just cover for me, all right? - Dad's got enough on his mind.
OTHERMALE:- All right, be calm, be calm, be calm.
SUPMALE:- Hello.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'll just put this over here.
LEADMALE:Mindy, you look beautiful, and Mork, you look almost human.
LEADFEMALE:And I really wanna thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I appreciate this.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, will you get up here? - What? What? Will you look at that wall there? - What are we looking at? - Right there at that wall.
SUPFEMALE:It's amazing how the floor and the ceiling kind of butt together right there.
LEADMALE:Mork, that is interesting, but I think maybe tonight it might be a good idea if we don't discuss wall appreciation with Dave.
LEADMALE:That's fine.
LEADFEMALE:Let see, I think we-- Help me here.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Why don't we sit down and have a little snort before dinner? You know how it always relaxes you.
OTHERFEMALE:It relaxes me too, you know.
LEADMALE:How about a little toddy for the body? Mindy, are you all right? Mork, I can't seem to control myself.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, why does this have to happen tonight? I don't know, Mind That's Dave.
OTHERMALE:He never has time to knock twice.
SUPMALE:Oh, I shall get it.
OTHERFEMALE:No, let me.
OTHERMALE:I'll answer it.
OTHERFEMALE:What's she doing? The bunny hop.
OTHERMALE:Listen, Mindy, what's going on around here? - Hello.
SUPMALE:- Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Caroline.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Dave.
LEADMALE:Hello, my name is Mork.
SUPMALE:I'm the Caucasian help this evening.
LEADFEMALE:I do not live with Mindy and it's a pleasure to have you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Well, come on, let's eat, junior.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, time is Krugerrands.
OTHERFEMALE:It's nice having you here, Uncle Dave.
OTHERFEMALE:My dear, what a lovely apartment.
LEADFEMALE:I just love way-- Please, please, you keep chattering, Mother, and we're gonna miss dessert.
LEADMALE:Well, Dave, I certainly hope you're hungry, because Mindy's prepared a wonderful dinner.
OTHERMALE:Incidentally, Mother, do you wanna pass along this fine bottle of sauce to junior? ''Chateau Lafitte McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:'' Your own vineyard.
LEADFEMALE:That's quite impressive, Dave.
LEADFEMALE:The fact is it's Mother's and mine, isn't it? Just north of Napa, a huge monastery, about 50 monks.
LEADMALE:We lost four.
OTHERFEMALE:Jumped a bus or something, I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Any rate, long about late July, early August, those little devils come out.
OTHERMALE:Jumping up and down their little feet and pressing out these grapes.
LEADMALE:Of course, there are no women at the monastery, are there, Mother? No, there are not.
LEADFEMALE:So you just see them jumping up and down, their little feet going away, stepping on those little grapes.
LEADMALE:Oh, Uncle Dave, sir, Aunt Caroline, can I show you the rest of the house? There's the attic up there, there's the bedroom over here.
LEADMALE:This is our living room, or as we like to call it, our ''living space.
OTHERMALE:'' Mindy, are you all right? Yes, I'll explain it to you later, but, Dad, I'm fine.
OTHERMALE:No, no, no, dinner's ready.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, well, let's all sit down, shall we? - Okay, let's go there.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go over and sit down.
SUPFEMALE:This is a very special occasion.
SUPMALE:Normally we have duck in a bucket.
SUPFEMALE:Here you are, Mother.
LEADFEMALE:Beat you to it, jelly belly.
LEADFEMALE:Get some therapy for her.
SUPMALE:Therapy.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, are you all right? She normally likes to do this, it's kind of like punk grace: ''Can you light the poo-bee?'' Mindy.
SUPMALE:Mindy, I am all hungry.
LEADFEMALE:Could I have something to eat? Would you like an olive? Yes, I'd like an olive.
LEADMALE:Good, good.
LEADFEMALE:Bombs away.
OTHERMALE:I wanna tell you something.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna tell you something.
LEADMALE:Fit her for an electric bonnet now.
LEADFEMALE:Set it at 580.
SUPMALE:Dave, I think that's just Mindy's way of making a little joke.
OTHERMALE:You should see her when she touches her tongue to her eyebrow.
LEADMALE:We haven't had a fly in here in three years.
SUPMALE:I'm telling you, you should put a muzzle on her and send her to an obedience school.
OTHERMALE:Hey, pickle puss.
SUPFEMALE:That does it.
SUPMALE:That does it.
SUPMALE:That does it.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Caroline, let's go.
LEADMALE:Let's get the coats.
SUPFEMALE:Next thing, she'll be howling at the moon.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:- I don't think she would do that.
LEADMALE:- No, please.
SUPMALE:- Would she? - I'm not sure.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait, Uncle Dave.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Dave, come back.
LEADMALE:Please, Aunt Caroline.
OTHERMALE:I don't know what came over me.
SUPFEMALE:Neither do I.
LEADMALE:Oh, I really apologise.
LEADMALE:You haven't even finished dinner and this means so much to Dad and me.
LEADMALE:Dave, look, I don't know what's come over Mindy, but please stay.
LEADMALE:Are you kidding? I told Caroline, I told you, coming in on the plane, this was gonna be a bummer of a reunion.
SUPMALE:And it's a bummer.
SUPFEMALE:I want out.
LEADMALE:I want out.
SUPFEMALE:But, Uncle Dave, sir, you can't leave with bitter memories in your mind.
LEADMALE:Why not leave with something sweet? Like, I have this dessert I made.
OTHERFEMALE:And you have to try it.
LEADMALE:Please? You know, incidentally, you seem like the only normal one here.
LEADFEMALE:Not bad, not bad.
LEADMALE:A little on the tart side, kind of gritty.
SUPMALE:Uncle Dave? Are you feeling all right? Right, right, right.
OTHERMALE:Of course I'm feeling all right, right, right, right.
LEADMALE:Left, left, left, company! All right, little girl, these are the trenches.
SUPMALE:Not easy to ride a horse in a trench, is it? Go on back in the tents there with the young children.
LEADMALE:Stay in that barn until the war's over.
LEADMALE:You, help with the walking wounded.
LEADFEMALE:They must be walking, however.
OTHERMALE:Crossed in front of a horse.
LEADFEMALE:Easy.
LEADFEMALE:All right, easy.
LEADFEMALE:Men, take a look at it.
LEADMALE:It's Whitey.
LEADMALE:No, the horse.
LEADFEMALE:There.
LEADMALE:Sergeant Major.
LEADFEMALE:Good to see you.
SUPFEMALE:Captain Bevre here.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, First Imperial Fusselieres.
LEADFEMALE:They were ready These are the trenches, of course.
LEADMALE:Hey, man, what's going on? I'm an American.
SUPFEMALE:Cheers, cheers.
SUPFEMALE:What division? Rainbow division.
OTHERMALE:Come on, man, shape up or ship out.
OTHERFEMALE:Love you, love you.
LEADMALE:Let's attack anyway.
SUPFEMALE:Brian, Brian.
LEADMALE:Oh, black people.
LEADFEMALE:Please, come over here.
LEADFEMALE:God bless you.
LEADFEMALE:I was kicked out of Sanders.
LEADFEMALE:They found me in a dress.
LEADMALE:Doesn't make any difference.
LEADMALE:Found you in what? - A gown.
LEADFEMALE:- A gown's better.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Father, look, thousands of Huns.
SUPFEMALE:- Bosch.
LEADFEMALE:- Yes, Bosch, Germans and Bosch.
SUPFEMALE:- Well - What's the Bosch? We're out of small soup with beets.
LEADFEMALE:I suppose.
LEADFEMALE:- We have some tools in the back.
LEADFEMALE:- Where? Where are they? How about this? Oh, my hand.
LEADMALE:My hand.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Hey, get it out.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, I'm hurt.
SUPFEMALE:I'm hurt.
LEADMALE:- I know you are, but you've killed the old man with four fingers in his head.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like the bloody war's over.
SUPMALE:- No, sir.
LEADMALE:- What a shame.
SUPFEMALE:And I've had no action.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I can't-- No, it's my medallions.
LEADMALE:We'll see you after the war, probably in a VW.
SUPFEMALE:Did somebody switch brothers on me? Oh, I've never seen him act like this before.
LEADMALE:Oh, I don't mean to pry, dear, but are you back from the war yet? Dave, what's come over you? Oh, I don't know, junior.
LEADMALE:I was just playing.
LEADFEMALE:You never did that with me.
LEADMALE:I mean, you never played with me when we were kids.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I know that.
LEADMALE:When I came along, as you know, I was first.
OTHERFEMALE:I was first.
LEADFEMALE:I knew at three years of age, I was first.
SUPFEMALE:They gave me a little kitty and a little doggy, and then Daddy would bounce me on his knee, left knee and then on his right knee.
SUPFEMALE:Then Mommy would just bounce me, she'd dribble me: And shoot me, and I'd say: And then you came along.
SUPFEMALE:I suppose I was jealous, insanely jealous.
OTHERFEMALE:I saw your little body in a 50-by-20 bed.
LEADMALE:They played with you, painted you up, made you a bizarre child.
SUPFEMALE:I began to hate you, hate you, hate you.
LEADMALE:And I don't like you anymore.
LEADMALE:I don't like you, Freddie.
LEADMALE:Don't like you, junior.
LEADMALE:You wonder why I'm different? Why I'm twisted and bent out of shape? Because you took my parents from me.
SUPFEMALE:Now, don't worry, Aunt Caroline.
SUPFEMALE:If anybody can find Uncle Dave, Mork can.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork, any luck? - No, I found him.
SUPFEMALE:You'll never guess where.
OTHERMALE:Time's up.
SUPMALE:Top of the flagpole, city hall.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Dave, dear, are you all right? Dave, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Now, Dave.
SUPFEMALE:Dave, look.
LEADFEMALE:Wait Well, excuse me, I think Dave needs me.
OTHERFEMALE:To yell at.
SUPFEMALE:It was the flek, Dad.
LEADMALE:He'll calm down.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Flek or no flek, Dave's right.
SUPFEMALE:We've never gotten along.
SUPMALE:We never will.
LEADMALE:But he's your brother, and he happens to feel like you've robbed him of something special.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want me to say to him? He doesn't listen.
SUPFEMALE:I'll talk to him, Pops.
LEADMALE:Who talked him out of the lobster tank at the Seafood Shanty? Now, Dave, I think Well, I guess he can't make it any worse than it already is.
SUPMALE:All right, let's go.
SUPMALE:Wait, wait, wait, Mind.
SUPMALE:Wait, wait.
SUPMALE:Let me tell you what Uncle Dave said first, he said: ''Tell junior, when I walk out, I don't wanna see him in this room, any room, anywhere, that even includes a sleazy hotel in Bangkok.
LEADMALE:'' It was wonderful seeing you and it's a good thing we did, because we'll probably never see you again.
LEADMALE:Dave, I don't want it to end like this.
LEADFEMALE:Just tell it to the doorman downstairs.
SUPMALE:Oh, now, you just hold it, brother.
SUPMALE:All my life, you've ignored me.
SUPFEMALE:You've humiliated me and you've made me itch like the devil, and I never stopped trying to win your approval.
LEADMALE:Do you know what it's like to love a brother and he doesn't love you back? It hurts.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, Dave.
SUPFEMALE:I still wish you well.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, kids, let's go.
LEADMALE:Oh, Daddy, you're so good at negotiating.
SUPFEMALE:Say something.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, junior.
LEADFEMALE:Give me a minute, will you? I learned a lot this evening.
LEADFEMALE:I really did.
LEADMALE:You made a fool out of me, man.
SUPFEMALE:I came off looking bad.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it's better that way, but I don't want it that way any longer.
SUPMALE:I want it to be right.
OTHERFEMALE:Folks are gone, and You and I are still brothers and we're still alive, still very much alive.
OTHERFEMALE:I want your love as bad as you want mine.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, come on, put it there, Freddie.
SUPMALE:You're still a dynamo.
LEADMALE:Oh, you rascal.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, why don't I take us all to dinner? Get your purse, will you, sweetheart? What's that for? For giving my father a brother.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, O mighty sequoia.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you call me sequoia, Mork? Well, sir, it's the fattest tree that I know.
OTHERMALE:- y our report, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Yes, sir.
SUPMALE:This week, sir, I learned about competition.
LEADFEMALE:The type of competition between different branches of the same family tree.
LEADFEMALE:You see, sir, how that it all ties it in, tree, roots, things like that.
LEADFEMALE:y ou told me earthlings were very competitive, but l didn't know they brought it home with them, Mork.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, sir, you see, sibling rivalry has been around for a long time.
OTHERMALE:Started with Cain and Abel competing for God's attention right through Donny and Marie competing for the same hairdo.
SUPMALE:Oh, Donny, why? But isn't competition a healthy thing? Well, sir, it can be.
SUPMALE:You see, I think a family should be like a team.
LEADFEMALE:They shouldn't be forced to wear pads to protect each other from contact.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone should be rooting each other on.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why don't they? Your Spruce Gooseness, it starts with one person comparing himself to another and he forgets that the only standards he has to meet are the ones he sets for himself.
SUPFEMALE:But isn't it through competition that greater heights are reached? Yes, sir, but I don't think you should use your family as stepping stones.
SUPMALE:Until next week, sir, na-no.
LEADMALE:Announcing the red-carpet treatment for Grandma's return home.
OTHERMALE:All this is going to be the most exciting of parties since the inauguration.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm celebrating too, but not quite as flamboyantly.
OTHERMALE:I'm trying to make Grandma's favourite dessert, peach cobbler.
SUPFEMALE:It looked so easy when she made it.
SUPMALE:A peach cobbler.
LEADFEMALE:Can he make me a little fuzzy pair of shoes, Mind? I know, that one was the pits, huh? I'm really looking forward to her visit.
LEADMALE:I've got my bedroom all cleaned and ready for her.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about that.
SUPMALE:I've turned my armoire into a hospitality suite.
OTHERFEMALE:If she can stand living with my moth collection.
LEADMALE:Let me show you.
OTHERMALE:Don't worry about that.
LEADFEMALE:Come on down, sweetheart, let's fly.
LEADFEMALE:Fly like the wind, fly like the wind.
SUPFEMALE:Let me show you what I've got for her now.
LEADFEMALE:First of all, I have a new trapeze to sleep on.
LEADMALE:And to make her feel really at home, her favourite pinup boy Thank you, Judy and Cissy, for that lovely iguana dance of love.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, that's really sweet, but I think Grandma would prefer to sleep horizontally.
LEADMALE:Why, Mind? You said she joined a swinging seniors club.
LEADMALE:This is not that kind of swinging.
LEADMALE:See, it's a group of active older people who believe that life doesn't have to be dull after 60.
LEADMALE:Oh, unless you watch Tom Snyder.
OTHERFEMALE:Look who's here.
OTHERFEMALE:- Grandma's back and you got her.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, Gram, it's so good to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, me too, Gram, that goes double for me.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, back off.
LEADFEMALE:Well, hi, Mork, how's my favourite spaceman? Oh, wonderful, Gram.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, bravissimo.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this is really a royal welcome.
SUPMALE:A banner, a red carpet and peach cobbler? Yeah, the kind that Grandma used to make, I hope.
OTHERMALE:Can you stay forever? Can you stay forever, please? Oh, that's sweet of you, Mork, but no.
SUPMALE:I can only stay three days.
OTHERFEMALE:And then I'm going on to Vegas.
SUPFEMALE:My group is having a convention.
LEADMALE:Yes, and it's her turn to pop out of the cake.
OTHERFEMALE:I only do that for the Shriners.
LEADMALE:Come on over here and tell us all about how you like living in Boston.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Boston is really the best.
LEADMALE:Here, you got a little something on your face.
OTHERFEMALE:- There.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:But living with my little sister Mildred is never easy.
SUPMALE:Well, you know how it is when they're that age.
OTHERMALE:They think they have all the answers.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I suppose I was the same way when I was 70.
SUPFEMALE:But enough about me, now tell me, what's the poop around here? Oh, let's scoop.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, we'll dish till dawn.
LEADFEMALE:First of all, Mindy got a job, I got a job, Carter lost a job.
LEADFEMALE:I wondered why peanut butter was getting so expensive.
LEADFEMALE:And Brooke Shields turned 40 on her 1 5th birthday, coleslaw's hard to reheat, and also, they put Walter Cronkite out to stud.
LEADFEMALE:Watch out, Grandma.
OTHERMALE:Well, you did ask what was new.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma, we've planned a special luncheon for you tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:We've got a lot of new friends in town and we've told them all about you.
OTHERMALE:Not all, dear.
OTHERFEMALE:The best hasn't happened yet.
LEADFEMALE:Well, dear, I do want to meet all your friends, yes, but, say, I'd better get out and bring in the rest of my things.
LEADFEMALE:Can I carry your barbells? Yes, dear, if you're sure they're not too heavy for you.
LEADMALE:You know, honey, your grandmother has been so sweet to me.
LEADFEMALE:Not one insult all day.
LEADFEMALE:I guess absence does make the heart grow fonder.
SUPMALE:Well, Fredzo, are you going to give us a hand, or are you just going to stand there like a wiener? Well, and so I told him, I said, ''Take your hand off my knee, buster, or you'll land a half hour before the plane does.
LEADMALE:'' Oh, Mindy, she's such a treat.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you get your spunk? Oh, I go to a clinic for spunk shots.
OTHERMALE:You know, Cora, you remind me of my grandmother.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, except you don't have a moustache.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, Remo, that's not nice.
LEADFEMALE:- Would be if she'd wax it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, look at her laugh.
SUPMALE:Isn't she cute the way her little cheeks shake? Mindy tells me that you're off to Las Vegas for a convention of swinging seniors? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:- I don't think I ever heard of them.
LEADMALE:Well, we travel a lot to promote the rights of the retired.
LEADMALE:It's something like the Grey Panthers, only we have leather shawls.
LEADFEMALE:Our slogan is: ''Bert Parks lives.
LEADFEMALE:'' Oh, gosh.
SUPMALE:Hey, I feel just like one of the girls.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, Cora, you know, that sounds like a really fascinating group.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it does.
OTHERMALE:- It'd make a great subject for a story.
OTHERMALE:- It would.
OTHERMALE:Grandma, would you do an interview with me down at the TV station? - Me on television? - Yeah.
SUPMALE:There'd be a lot of people out there who'd love to hear about you and your group.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy, nobody's going to be interested in me.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll have to get a new hat.
LEADFEMALE:Mind? I looked through every nook and cranny and I couldn't find Granny.
OTHERFEMALE:I just don't understand it.
LEADFEMALE:She was just gonna go out and buy a new hat then come straight back here and get ready for the interview.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? Listening for thundering beat of sensible shoes.
SUPFEMALE:- I'd better just go look for her myself.
LEADMALE:- Oh, let me go with you, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Grandma, are you all right? Oh, I guess so, but I never was so frightened in all my life.
LEADMALE:Oh, here, sit down.
OTHERMALE:- Look at my new hat.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, what happened? Oh, children, it was dreadful.
LEADMALE:Well, I was just walking through the park on my way home, and I was mugged.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's awful.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, Grams, you're home now.
LEADFEMALE:Ma'am, we'll do our best, but don't get your hopes up.
LEADFEMALE:- We can't be everywhere at once.
LEADFEMALE:- I know.
LEADMALE:You know, there's so many of them and too few of us.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
SUPMALE:Good night.
SUPMALE:- Thank you.
LEADMALE:- Good night.
SUPMALE:ls that what they call a cop-out, Mind? You know, that really ticks me off.
LEADMALE:Three guys mug Grandma in broad daylight and the police can't even do anything about it.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, I hope you won't mind, dear, but I don't feel up to doing that interview tonight.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, I understand, Grandma.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, can I get you anything? How about a nice cup of tea? No.
LEADMALE:No, thank you, dear.
LEADMALE:Well, how about some Jell-O with corn? No.
SUPFEMALE:No, dear, I think I'll just go and lie down for a while.
LEADFEMALE:It just hasn't been my day.
LEADMALE:Oh, Grams, if you don't like that one, how about some tapioca with peas? Mork, thank you, but no.
LEADMALE:What's wrong with Grams? It's like they've let the air out of her life.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, Mork, mugging's a terrible thing.
LEADMALE:- It's too bad it's not like on Ork.
LEADFEMALE:There, mugging is when someone follows you and goes, ''Hey, mister:'' Well, on Earth, you get roughed up and robbed and it's really scary.
LEADFEMALE:Why would they wanna do something like that to Granny, though? Well, it's much easier to pick on the elderly, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:They're less likely to put up much of a resistance.
SUPFEMALE:You know, this is the only planet in the universe that has no respect for its elders.
LEADFEMALE:- That's not much to be proud of, is it? - No.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I gotta go to work.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I sure hate to leave Grandma after she's been through all this.
SUPMALE:- Don't worry, I'll take care of her.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I'll make sure she's well protected.
SUPFEMALE:I've also realised one thing, Mind.
SUPMALE:Granny's a member of an endangered species.
LEADFEMALE:They're gonna expect me to fill the time with an interview at the station.
OTHERFEMALE:- What are you gonna do? - I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I'll fill it with an editorial.
SUPMALE:Yeah, and I think I have a real strong topic.
LEADMALE:- Good luck.
SUPFEMALE:- Thanks.
OTHERMALE:Cora's still asleep, thank goodness.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of planet are you running? If this happened back on Ork, we'd have those thugs recycled into bedpans.
LEADMALE:Look, here's Mindy's spot.
LEADFEMALE:The following is an editorial and does not necessarily reflect the opinions of KTNS television, or its management.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy, wasn't she great? Good evening, everyone.
SUPMALE:This is Mindy McConnell.
SUPMALE:And tonight l had planned to interview one of Boulder's outstanding senior citizens.
LEADMALE:However, she's unable to be here tonight because of a senseless, unprovoked crime.
LEADFEMALE:She was mugged.
LEADMALE:This incident occurred in broad daylight in a park where she has felt safe for over 50 years.
LEADFEMALE:Crimes against the elderly increase every year in this country.
LEADFEMALE:What is the value of a longer life expectancy if we're forced to spend it behind locked doors? Well, today my grandmother was a victim.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow it could be you or yours.
LEADFEMALE:l don't have any answers, but something has to be done about it now.
LEADFEMALE:We must get involved and we have to do it now.
SUPMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADMALE:What a girl.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, that should get some action.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're not kidding, Pops.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're not kidding there.
LEADFEMALE:Yessiree, bobcat.
LEADFEMALE:Boy.
SUPFEMALE:I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:What do you mean? No, sir, I don't have a mother.
SUPMALE:That makes me mad too.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean my mother? Oh, that's it.
LEADMALE:What happened? What's all that yelling? Oh, I'm sorry, Grams.
LEADMALE:But Mindy just goosed my civic consciousness.
LEADFEMALE:She was just on TV, Cora.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy gave an inspiring editorial on protection for the elderly.
LEADMALE:Oh, bless her heart.
LEADMALE:But I don't know how much good it'll do.
LEADMALE:It just is not safe outside.
OTHERMALE:I'm scared.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm going back to Boston.
SUPMALE:Oh, but what about your swinging seniors? Well, they'll just have to swing without me.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'd feel a lot better under my own roof.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I know you both care, but But I just want to go home.
LEADMALE:Well, if that's what you want, Cora.
SUPMALE:But I wish you'd think it over.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yeah.
SUPMALE:- Look, I - I'm afraid I have to get to the concert.
SUPFEMALE:- Okay.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, Grams.
LEADFEMALE:- Is there anything we can do? - I don't think so, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:She's afraid and she doesn't feel safe.
SUPMALE:Maybe a monthly cheque isn't the kind of social security she really needs.
LEADFEMALE:You know, the money those muggers took can be replaced, but the thing that really burns me up is they stole her spirit.
SUPMALE:And how do you get that back? Hey, Gram, now, come on, you can't leave.
LEADFEMALE:That'd be like giving up.
LEADFEMALE:And if you do that, I mean, then you'll be afraid to go anywhere.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what can I do about it, Mork? You heard what that policeman said.
LEADMALE:Oh, I wish those punks could be in my shoes and then they'd know how I felt.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Time out.
LEADMALE:Raindrops falling on the fertile fields of fair play.
OTHERMALE:Mork, what are you talking about? Well, Grandma, I think I have a foolproof plan.
SUPMALE:I just hope I'm fool enough to pull it off.
OTHERMALE:Come along, Clara.
LEADMALE:Coming, Cora.
SUPMALE:You know, dear, I just think I had a blowout in my Supp-Hose.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, do you think this is a good idea? No, no, no, Cora, it's Clara.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, don't let your mind wander, dear.
LEADMALE:Don't let it check out with the baggage again.
LEADMALE:Now, if we're gonna catch these rats, we're gonna have to spread out the Velveeta.
LEADMALE:Come on now, dear.
OTHERFEMALE:And try and act like an old lady.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'll try, but I must admit I am a little nervous.
LEADMALE:In fact, I'm scared to death.
SUPMALE:Oh, don't you worry.
LEADMALE:Now, here, have one of these.
LEADFEMALE:Have a little prune daiquiri.
LEADMALE:- No, thank you, Mork-- Clara.
OTHERFEMALE:- Kidding, just kidding.
LEADMALE:Oh, dear, are you sure you can handle these muggers? No, dear, you're gonna handle them just like we planned.
LEADMALE:Now, come along, honey, come along.
OTHERFEMALE:I remember what my first husband Robert said to me before he died.
LEADMALE:He said, ''Hon--'' My son, the doctor, he never writes me anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:He just sends money.
LEADFEMALE:Lots of cold, hard cash.
OTHERFEMALE:You look tired, dear.
SUPFEMALE:Shall we sit a spell? Oh, honey, let's do that.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just sit.
LEADMALE:Set right down.
LEADMALE:Here we are.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this bag is so heavy.
SUPFEMALE:Too bad I cashed all my T-bills today.
LEADFEMALE:Sure is a shame to carry around this much money, you know.
OTHERFEMALE:We're talking megabucks here.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, enough to feed, like-- Oh, Mork, I think I see somebody coming.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so scared.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't be paranoid, dear.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's a mini mugger, hold on to your bubble gum.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you ladies know you shouldn't be out this late? Well, thank you for your concern, dear, but we're quite all right.
SUPFEMALE:It's dangerous here.
LEADMALE:I'd feel better if you let me walk you home.
SUPFEMALE:Now, young man, don't you worry about a thing because my friend here has brass knuckles and I have an inflatable Doberman in here.
LEADMALE:Now, take a hike.
LEADMALE:- Well, all right, but you be careful.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, we will.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess I'll have to get my merit badge in girl-scout watching.
LEADFEMALE:Dear, this doesn't seem to be working out, Mork.
LEADMALE:Maybe we'd better leave.
LEADFEMALE:Now, Cora, Cora, Cora.
OTHERFEMALE:We came here to get mugged and we're not leaving till we do.
LEADMALE:- There they-- - Oh, my God.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, look, it's the road company from Deliverance.
LEADMALE:Hello, boys.
SUPMALE:Squeal, hug.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you better hold on to your wallets, there are muggers about here, there really are.
LEADFEMALE:Clara, dear, they are the muggers.
LEADMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:Welcome to the park.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Granny, give me that purse.
LEADMALE:No, no.
OTHERMALE:Trust me, it doesn't go with your shoes.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, isn't this the old lady from this afternoon? - Sic them away.
LEADFEMALE:- What's the matter, you old frump? Didn't you get enough? Don't you worry, Grams.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about a thing.
LEADMALE:Give me the bag, you old bag.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, all right, I have a little Orkan surprise for you in here.
LEADMALE:What's wrong with me? I feel like I'm a hundred years old.
LEADMALE:- Me too.
LEADFEMALE:- What? - Mork, they sound so old.
OTHERFEMALE:- Well, they are, Cora.
LEADMALE:You see, I put them in an Orkan age warp.
LEADFEMALE:That way, on the outside they're young, but on the inside, they're celebrating the bicentennial.
OTHERMALE:Grab them, you guys.
LEADMALE:Oh, I gotta sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you just take a little nap and we'll wake you up when the Republicans revoke your pension.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you dare.
LEADMALE:No, no-- - One down.
SUPFEMALE:- Hand over the watch, Granny.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, no, no, please, not that.
SUPFEMALE:My husband gave me that.
OTHERMALE:Come on, Grams.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't have to give them anything.
LEADMALE:Remember, they're in your shoes now.
OTHERMALE:Now, what was I saying? Oh, yes, I said let's have the watch.
SUPFEMALE:Stick it in your nose and blow it out your ear.
LEADMALE:Gram, now you-- That-- - Gram, I didn't know you knew karate.
LEADMALE:- Well, I don't, but I love Bruce Lee movies.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Enter the Granny.
OTHERMALE:I don't know what you've done to us, but you're gonna pay for it.
SUPMALE:All right, here's a down payment, sucker.
LEADMALE:Pick on helpless people, will you? Somebody grab her purse.
SUPMALE:And then carry me to the car.
SUPFEMALE:You hear that, darling? They want your purse.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you just give it to them, dear? Well, you're absolutely right, Clara.
SUPMALE:How rude of me.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, honey, take mine, it's industrial strength.
SUPFEMALE:Look, we got them.
SUPMALE:We gotta quit now.
OTHERFEMALE:There they are, officer.
SUPFEMALE:Slap the cuffs on them and throw the book at them.
LEADMALE:- Oh, you're a good Boy Scout there.
SUPFEMALE:- Come on, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Officer.
LEADMALE:Officer, these men mugged me this afternoon.
LEADMALE:- They did? - Yeah.
SUPMALE:Looks like they picked on the wrong lady.
LEADFEMALE:Straighten up.
SUPFEMALE:- Sure, that's easy for you to say.
OTHERFEMALE:- You really roughed them up.
OTHERMALE:Oh, we did it in a ladylike fashion though.
OTHERMALE:You ladies will have to file a report later.
LEADFEMALE:You got it, blue eyes.
LEADMALE:Young man, you deserve a very special merit badge.
LEADMALE:Who needs merit badges? For this, I'll make the cover of Boys' Life.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
OTHERFEMALE:- Well, Clara.
SUPFEMALE:- Well, Cora.
LEADMALE:Shall we head on home? Well, honey, let's just take a hike ourselves.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:You know, what a day this has been.
SUPMALE:Oh, I better get this girdle back to Mindy, it's starting to ride up a little.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, everybody, let's get going.
LEADFEMALE:Cora, we gotta get to the airport or you're gonna miss that shuttle to Las Vegas.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hold your water, Fredzo.
LEADMALE:''Fredzo.
LEADFEMALE:'' I'm gonna miss that.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm so glad to have my wallet back again.
LEADMALE:You know, they didn't even wrinkle that picture of Willie Nelson.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm gonna miss you, Gram.
OTHERFEMALE:Next time you're just gonna have to stay longer.
LEADFEMALE:- Three days is not long enough.
LEADFEMALE:- No.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I promise, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:Come on, Mork, we're ready to go.
LEADMALE:What are you doing in that outfit? It's not the same outfit, Mind, it's a bolder print.
LEADMALE:Stunning.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're just jealous because you don't have legs like that.
SUPFEMALE:- Mork, enough is enough.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, I know, Mind, I know.
OTHERFEMALE:I should've worn the pink because it would've gone better with the blue hair.
SUPFEMALE:Now, Mindy, don't be hard on Mork.
LEADFEMALE:After all, if it hadn't been for his dressing up to look like me, I'd still be in a blue funk.
OTHERMALE:We owe him a lot.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess you're right.
LEADFEMALE:We do owe you a lot, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:After all, you did help Grandma get her spirit back.
LEADMALE:But, Clara, dear, would you please change the dress for me? All of you, I just want you to know that I have a date with a very wonderful gentleman caller this evening.
SUPFEMALE:- You do? - Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, coming, darling.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:Don't spoil it, don't spoil it.
LEADMALE:Hi, Clara, you ready? Oh, yes, darling.
LEADMALE:Now, we're gonna be crossing a very, very wide street, so don't wait up.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you tell me more about your grandfather? Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't fail me now.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, my main mammoth.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, now what's gotten into you? Oh, spirit's got a hold of me, sir.
OTHERMALE:Gonna make me dance.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Beebs.
LEADMALE:You'd be a better dancer if you had feet, but let's go.
LEADFEMALE:y ou've been warned about Earth spirits.
OTHERMALE:Are you possessed again? Oh, no, sir.
LEADMALE:I'm just dancing to the beat of life.
LEADMALE:This week I learned, sir, that without the right spirit, you don't stand a ghost of a chance.
LEADFEMALE:How do you get the right spirit, Mork? Well, most earthlings are born with it, sir, but the hard part is to keep it.
LEADFEMALE:- How do people lose it? - Well, in this case, sir, old people are sometimes ignored, or they're pushed aside, and most of all, sir, they're targets of abuse.
LEADFEMALE:They don't really lose it as much as it's stolen from them.
OTHERMALE:- That's criminal.
SUPMALE:- I know, sir.
LEADFEMALE:It's my theory, sir, that old people have made a major contribution to society and they deserve a better return than just half-price at the movies.
LEADMALE:If we really wanna make their years golden I think we should pay them with our gratitude and respect.
OTHERMALE:Until next week, sir.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Don't start without me, Mary Lou.
OTHERMALE:Hi, it's time for Shape up with Mary Lou.
LEADMALE:First, some simple warm-ups.
LEADFEMALE:Follow me.
LEADFEMALE:There, there.
SUPMALE:That should build up your bust.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, when I left Ork, I said ''Earth or bust.
LEADMALE:'' Now I've got both, yeah.
OTHERMALE:Now, let's journey to your inner thighs.
LEADMALE:Oh, mondo cellulite.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:y ou beginners can sit this one out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, beginners.
OTHERMALE:Scoff, scoff.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you what you wanna know.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you're home.
SUPMALE:- I have something I wanna ask you.
LEADFEMALE:- Mind, I've something I wanna ask.
SUPFEMALE:- Can you get my legs back together? - What? Oh, okay, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you ever do that again.
OTHERMALE:All right, Mind, shoot.
SUPMALE:Well, I sort of have this problem at work.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Sternhagen, my boss, wants to give me a promotion and a chance to do my own show.
OTHERFEMALE:Mind, oh, you poor pitiful Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, that is a problem.
LEADMALE:How are you ever going to live it down? Mork, that's not the problem part.
SUPFEMALE:See, the rival network came up with this new gossip show and their ratings went sky-high.
LEADMALE:So now Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Sternhagen is hot to do one with me as producer and star.
LEADMALE:- Are we to the problem part yet, Mind? - Yes, Mork.
LEADMALE:See, it is a chance to move up, but on the other hand, I don't know if I can go on TV and gossip about people.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think? In order to give you the advantage of my superior intelligence and computer-like brain, I need one minor piece of information.
LEADFEMALE:What's gossip? I forgot.
LEADMALE:Well, gossip is when people tell personal details about other people's lives.
SUPFEMALE:For instance, if I told you I was having a secret romance with Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley and you told someone else, then that would be gossip.
OTHERFEMALE:You and Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley? Oh, Mind.
LEADMALE:I mean, even in these promiscuous times, I shouldn't care, but I'm always the last to know.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not hypoglycaemic, you don't need a sugar daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, now.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy, all right, I'll leave.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to be excess baggage or a third nostril.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, it's not true.
SUPMALE:That's the point.
LEADMALE:Most gossip isn't true.
SUPMALE:It's like those magazines you see in the supermarket that tell all those intimate details about famous people's lives.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you mean like the ones that have the ridiculous photos that no one would believe.
LEADMALE:Like ones with a picture of Sonny Bono getting a standing ovation.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, also TV has gossip commentators too.
LEADFEMALE:You've seen them.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, that'd be like Dan Rather slinging Roger Mudd.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I think you're starting to get the idea.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, how could I make up stories like that? I mean, I don't even know where I'd get stories like that.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, maybe soaking in a hot bubble bath will make me feel a lot cleaner about the situation.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, say hi to Mr.
LEADMALE:Suds.
SUPMALE:- Okay.
LEADFEMALE:If Mindy can't get those stories and that gossip, I'll get them for her, and the promotion too.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's what I'll do.
LEADMALE:Hello? Information? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, I'd like the truth about M*A*S*H.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, is it true that Corporal Klinger is really Danny Thomas' sister? Excuse me, padre.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Can you tell me about your latest secret romance? Oh, that's all right.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll read about it in True Confessions.
LEADFEMALE:Or maybe Vatican After Dark.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, one more.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hello, there.
LEADMALE:Potato salad.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, Ebony.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:What's my little shutterbug up to now? Looking for gossip.
LEADMALE:Heard the latest? - No.
LEADMALE:- What is it? I was hoping you'd know.
LEADFEMALE:Jeanie, I'm telling you, that guy is a bum.
SUPFEMALE:Nelson, this is your fifth glass of water.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you order something I can charge you for? Remo, do I sense something personal you wanna get off your macho chest? And don't you leave out a titbit.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I'm sorry, but it's Jeanie.
SUPMALE:She's dating another one of those bums, some ambulance-chasing lawyer.
LEADMALE:This guy's got a neck brace as a hood ornament.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:The guy with the license plate that says whiplash.
LEADMALE:That's him.
SUPFEMALE:I'd like to give that lowlife a whiplash.
SUPMALE:Will you stop flashing in my restaurant? Remo, could we sit down and talk about this in the kitchen? - Excuse me, Remo.
LEADMALE:- Hey.
SUPMALE:Boy, hot flashes and dizzy spells.
LEADFEMALE:There's some great scoops here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, a cockroach.
SUPFEMALE:There's plenty of room.
SUPMALE:Don't push.
LEADFEMALE:Garcon, table for 1 2.
SUPFEMALE:The rest of you wait on the burro.
LEADFEMALE:- Exidor.
SUPMALE:- Mork.
OTHERMALE:Is that you? Mork, I've been looking all over for you.
LEADMALE:Have you tried my house? What a novel idea.
SUPFEMALE:Enough of this idle chatter.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I've got great news.
SUPMALE:I've written my life story.
LEADFEMALE:I call it Lauren Bacall: By Myself.
LEADMALE:It worked for her.
LEADMALE:Why tinker with success? It screams bestseller.
LEADMALE:The answer to your question, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Sensationalism.
LEADFEMALE:Why, I've devoted an entire chapter to never dating Shelley Winters.
LEADFEMALE:That sounds hot and heavy.
LEADFEMALE:Can you imagine the movie it'll make? But who could play me? Now, let's see.
SUPFEMALE:Fabian's too old.
LEADMALE:Benji's too short.
LEADMALE:And we can't afford Suzanne Somers.
LEADFEMALE:On to the burro, boys.
LEADMALE:We're off for Tinseltown.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, by the way, did I tell you? The museum wants to do me in wax.
SUPMALE:They say it stops hurting after it cools off.
OTHERMALE:- What am I gonna do? - Honey, listen, I understand.
LEADMALE:It's your decision and it's a doozy, but what's always worked for me through the years is trusting my instincts.
SUPMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:- If he gets mad, he gets mad.
SUPMALE:- He gets mad.
LEADMALE:I mean, so that's life.
SUPFEMALE:That's life.
SUPMALE:Hello, is Mis--? Oh, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Sternhagen.
LEADFEMALE:This is Mindy McConnell.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:Sternhagen, I just can't do that gossip report tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:Why? Well, it's because I feel that No, it's because I really think that I feel that I'm really not feeling very well.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'm not feeling very well.
OTHERMALE:Way to go.
LEADFEMALE:Sort of.
SUPMALE:Hello, Mr.
LEADMALE:Sternhagen.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Mork, Mindy's friend.
OTHERFEMALE:Where is she? Oh, hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Aren't you Mork, Mindy's friend? Yes, and I have all the information here, great photos and some fantastic scoops.
LEADMALE:Aren't you Mork, Mindy's friend? Yes, sir, you're two for two now.
LEADFEMALE:- You seem a bit under the weather.
LEADMALE:- Do you know what? You probably haven't noticed, but I'm a little bit under the weather.
LEADMALE:And do you know why I'm under the weather? Because Mindy McConnell rained-- Mindy McConnell rained on my parade.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, not little Mindy Sunshine.
OTHERMALE:No, little Mindy Monsoon.
LEADMALE:She called me up, and she said she couldn't do the show because she was si Because Because she was sick.
LEADMALE:She don't feel good.
LEADFEMALE:What will this do for her golden career opportunity, though, sir? Oh, well, now, just lookie here.
SUPMALE:This.
SUPMALE:Do you see that fern? - Yes.
LEADFEMALE:- It will be promoted before she will be.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's terrible.
LEADFEMALE:Not as terrible as Dewey Fishbeck's Farm Report.
LEADFEMALE:I have to put that back-- That back on the air and it never got a rating until Dewey tried to milk a bull.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, I've got all the stuff here, and she'll be ready by tomorrow.
SUPMALE:Let me substitute tonight.
SUPFEMALE:You? Fine.
LEADMALE:You have 1 5 seconds.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADMALE:No pressure.
LEADFEMALE:That was a truce.
SUPMALE:And four, three, two, showtime.
SUPMALE:Hello, Hollywood.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, actually, this is Mork, alias Tex Tile, coming to you tonight.
SUPMALE:Well, we've got an earful for you.
SUPFEMALE:First of all, a flash.
LEADMALE:Whoa, watch out.
LEADFEMALE:I have some wonderful things.
LEADFEMALE:Fasten your belts.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know if I can tell.
LEADMALE:Gonna be an earful.
SUPMALE:I can't tell you.
LEADFEMALE:No, well, I can-- No, I can't.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes-- Well, do it.
LEADMALE:Okay, I dragged it out of myself.
LEADMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:What blond bombshell with the initials Glenda Faye Comstock is driving what albino lad to drink? Let's see what we have here? Behold, behold, behold.
LEADMALE:Watch out ''Tacky'' Tom, we're coming at you.
OTHERMALE:Yes, also, what restaurant owner/best friend had to stop him from finishing his fifth? Well, Remo, Remo DaVinci, you get a Mork merit badge, but don't get too attached to that badge, because we might be talking recall.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, watch out here.
SUPFEMALE:Why did you play Raging Remo with your defenceless sister, Jeanie? Let's see how that fits together.
SUPMALE:Watch out there.
OTHERFEMALE:We're not talking too much talky town talk.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what ailing KTNS reporter likes to sing in the shower? Perhaps you should ask her downstairs neighbour why.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, for all these questions, I'm sure you know the answers, Mindy.
SUPMALE:I hope this brought back lots of colours to your cheek.
LEADMALE:We'll be back, Boulder, so keep your stations tuned in and we're gonna dish till dawn.
SUPFEMALE:Terrific, kid.
LEADFEMALE:A star is born.
LEADMALE:Well.
LEADMALE:Congrat-- Congratulations.
SUPFEMALE:I'd have sworn you were Miss Rona if I hadn't seen your hair move.
LEADFEMALE:- All right, where's Mork the Mouse? - Yeah, where is he? - Look, Remo, we're all mad at Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:So let's just calm down, be rational, and find out how high he can bounce.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:- Well - Oh, hold that pose.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, are we all supri--? Wait, is this a surprise party for me just for what I did this evening? - You - Hey! Hey.
LEADMALE:We are all very mad at you.
LEADMALE:Why, because you didn't bring the punch and the cookies? Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:Let's not get physical here.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you guys all should go home and let me handle this.
OTHERFEMALE:That sounds reasonable, Mindy.
SUPMALE:I guess we were taking the law in our own hands.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, it will give me time to find a taxidermist.
LEADFEMALE:Mork will look great above my mantle.
OTHERMALE:I don't know if I can ever call you snugglepuss again.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, wait, wait.
OTHERMALE:Was it something I said? Why do I feel like we're gonna have one of our little talks? Come in, please.
OTHERMALE:Hi, there.
OTHERMALE:Wanna get wet? Look, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley, I can explain this.
LEADMALE:See, Mork was feeling-- Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:I saw Mork's show, and I didn't believe a word of it.
SUPMALE:But I'm happy to report that Boulder does.
SUPFEMALE:The phone hasn't stopped ringing.
LEADMALE:How nice.
LEADMALE:As a famous greeting card writer, I'm used to this kind of sordid innuendo.
OTHERFEMALE:You have no idea how many fans out there are after a piece of the Bick.
LEADMALE:Yes, I think we've heard enough.
SUPFEMALE:Well, kids, I'll be running along now.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm glad you didn't believe that silly story.
SUPMALE:Not a word of it.
OTHERMALE:If you're not busy later on, you know where to find me.
LEADFEMALE:Don't beat me.
OTHERMALE:Don't beat me.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, don't beat me Now do you see what can happen when rumours get started? Well, Mr.
SUPMALE:Bickley was happy, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:He's one out of the whole town.
OTHERFEMALE:That's not a great average, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Do you realize how many reputations you could have ruined tonight? Everyone was happy when I told them juicy pieces of gossip.
SUPFEMALE:I don't even understand why I'm on the endangered Orkan list.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it's not fair, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:It's not fair, not fair.
SUPMALE:Mork, that's because no one likes to hear gossip about themselves.
LEADFEMALE:It's all right when it's about somebody else.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that a little two-sided? Walking the two-sided way of life.
SUPFEMALE:No way, double truths.
LEADFEMALE:Double truths, watch out.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Let me put it to you this way.
LEADFEMALE:How would you like it if I told everyone that you ate eggs? Lying shiksa goddess.
LEADFEMALE:So how does it feel? Well Give me that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I didn't tell any lies, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but you didn't tell the whole truth, either.
SUPFEMALE:And sometimes, half-truths are worse than lies.
SUPFEMALE:How come they do it in the papers and TV and you were about to do it? I didn't say I was gonna do it.
LEADMALE:I didn't say I was gonna do it.
SUPMALE:I just said I got sick.
OTHERMALE:Isn't that a half-truth? The point is, you better do something, or you're gonna lose all your friends.
LEADFEMALE:And I better do something or I'm gonna lose my job.
LEADFEMALE:- What can we do, Mind? - I don't know.
SUPMALE:But we've got a lot of people to apologise to, and we've gotta find a way to do it.
LEADMALE:Well, let's start tonight.
LEADMALE:I'll go get Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Bickley, and I'll meet you in the shower.
LEADFEMALE:Five, four, three, two, we're live.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, I'm Mindy McConnell and the show is Rumour Has lt.
SUPMALE:Today's topic, What Makes a Good Gossip Report? To answer that question, I've invited back yesterday's guest host, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hi, you, Ed.
LEADFEMALE:How about that band, huh? Hey, hey, Doc.
LEADMALE:Hi, Snoozy, Lumpy, Squeezy.
LEADFEMALE:Mork was a little late in getting here.
SUPFEMALE:I was a little late.
SUPFEMALE:How late was I? - So late, the rabbit had been dead-- - Why don't we take a behind-the-scenes look at what goes into making a good gossip report.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thank you, what a wildly spontaneous pre-rehearsed idea.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for setting me up for that one.
LEADMALE:Bless you.
LEADMALE:Yes, to continue, maybe you could tell us, Mork, what ingredients go into a good gossip report? All right.
LEADMALE:First of all, you have to have the right costume.
LEADFEMALE:It's very important to be inconspicuous when you're out searching for information.
LEADMALE:It also takes the right attitude and especially, the right questions.
LEADMALE:For example.
SUPMALE:Hey, are you still beating that dog of yours? What? I don't have a dog.
LEADMALE:Got fed up and ran away.
LEADMALE:Hey, so it's just you and the goat now, huh? What? What goat? Oh, there's more than one? Maybe there's a sheep going, ''Not bad.
LEADMALE:'' As you can see, there's no answering a question like that.
LEADMALE:You got it, dog beater.
LEADMALE:Could we just continue with what we discussed? Like why my stories may appear to be a little dull compared to yours.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, I'll give you a little example right here.
LEADFEMALE:Pick any story and we'll spice it up.
SUPFEMALE:We'll make that sucker sing.
LEADMALE:All right, let's see.
OTHERMALE:I think I have a story right here.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, here's one: ''Last night, young Amy Prescott was rescued from a second-story fire by volunteer fireman Rob Wilson.
LEADFEMALE:She suffered from smoke inhalation and had to be revived by mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
SUPMALE:She is reported in good condition at a County Hospital.
OTHERMALE:'' Boring, Mind.
SUPMALE:Snooze City.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't buy that in a supermarket checkout.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't even buy it for the cat.
LEADFEMALE:What would you do to make that more interesting? Observe, Mindy, watch this place sizzle.
LEADMALE:Young Amy tells all about burning desire of second-story man.
SUPFEMALE:Dateline Sizzle City.
SUPMALE:Watch out.
OTHERMALE:Last night, while Mr.
LEADFEMALE:and Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Boulder were sleeping, Rob Wilson's temperature was rising as he crept into Amy Prescott's room wearing rubber boots and a helmet.
SUPFEMALE:Watch out.
SUPMALE:And all young Amy remembers is his hot sweaty face looming over her as he pressed his parched lips to hers.
SUPMALE:Then he roared off in the night in his long red vehicle, leaving young Amy to wonder where, who, why.
SUPMALE:You know, I think I'm beginning to understand.
SUPFEMALE:And you know what? I don't think I could do that kind of reporting.
OTHERMALE:Even if it means my job.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mind, there's a price we all have to pay and I have had to pay a certain price too.
OTHERFEMALE:I wanna ask you all, what's missing from this picture? That's right.
LEADMALE:All my friends.
SUPFEMALE:I just want to say to all of them, I'm sorry for what I said yesterday because it wasn't true, and I And you're the best friends I have in the world, and I really miss you.
LEADFEMALE:Nelson, Remo, Jeanie and Glenda.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take a picture next time and don't be mad.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the choice is yours, people of Boulder.
LEADMALE:Is this gossip the kind of reporting you wanna see, or would you rather hear the truth? We'll be back after this commercial.
LEADFEMALE:Good stand, Mindy.
OTHERMALE:But I opt for the smut.
SUPMALE:The phones are lighting up, Miss McConnell.
SUPMALE:It's your friends.
LEADMALE:They like your show, and they forgive Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hurray and huzzah.
LEADFEMALE:Too bad you're not working for them.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm sorry, Mr.
LEADMALE:Sternhagen, but I just can't do that kind of gossip reporting.
SUPMALE:Then you leave me with no choice.
SUPMALE:- Oh, I'll take it, Mr.
LEADMALE:Sternhagen.
SUPMALE:- Mork.
LEADMALE:I mean, I've got one more story, some real dirt, some terra firma here.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, sir, but do you know who this is? - Where did you get that? - Let's say I have my sources.
LEADMALE:The story goes like this: What's this Boulder TV exec doing with this bombshell who's not his wife? - Then the story gets hot and intense.
SUPFEMALE:- That's my daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, why tell people that and ruin a perfectly good story? Yes, I see.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Mindy, you're right about this show.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I like about you.
LEADFEMALE:You've got principles.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you take the night off and I'll carry on from here? Thank you, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Sternhagen.
OTHERFEMALE:Back on.
OTHERMALE:Good evening.
LEADFEMALE:And welcome to the Farm Report.
LEADMALE:- Pork bellies are low - Where did you get that picture? I thought you'd learned.
SUPFEMALE:None of your business.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you're right.
OTHERFEMALE:But you know, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Sternhagen's daughter is really beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but I don't think she gets along with her mother well.
OTHERFEMALE:Why would you say that? When Mrs.
LEADMALE:Sternhagen came into the restaurant, her daughter ducked under the table and crawled out the back door.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, oh, Chubby Cheeker.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, why are we whispering? Sir, don't tell a soul.
LEADMALE:I've got a story that's gonna make your toes tingle.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that right, Beebs? What are you talking about, Mork? Well, sir, we're talking about gossip.
SUPMALE:You know, your rumours, your innuendo, your hearsay.
SUPFEMALE:This week, I learned how popular it is with Earthlings unless it's about them.
OTHERMALE:People like to hear things that aren't true? Oh, yes, Your Skinnyness.
LEADMALE:l get your point.
LEADMALE:But you see, sir, sometimes these stories can get out of hand.
LEADMALE:Earthlings are given a special privilege called freedom of speech.
OTHERMALE:But it isn't really free if it costs someone his reputation.
LEADFEMALE:Are you saying this freedom must be exercised with caution? Oh, yes, sir.
LEADMALE:It comes with a responsibility of knowing what not to say and when not to say it.
LEADMALE:lnteresting.
OTHERMALE:And yet you say gossip is popular on Earth.
LEADMALE:Yes, I'm afraid people will always have an appetite for juicy titbits, even though most of it is hard to swallow.
SUPMALE:Until next week, sir, bon appetit.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it.
OTHERMALE:What a morning to be late.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'd like to get my hands on the guy who invented the snooze alarm.
LEADMALE:Morning, morning Oh, Mind, let me help you with those suckers.
LEADMALE:Come on now, hon.
SUPMALE:That's all right.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that lovely? - Here we are.
SUPMALE:- Thanks, Mork.
LEADMALE:But I was trying to put the boot on.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I guess we start off the day on the wrong foot, huh? Well, Mind, I'm really famished.
LEADFEMALE:I feel like Gandhi at a McDonald's.
LEADMALE:Come on now.
LEADFEMALE:I feel I can eat an aardvark's tongue.
LEADFEMALE:Come on now, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Sorry, Mork, but I'm production coordinator on a new show today and I've gotta be at the studio in ten minutes.
OTHERFEMALE:You could fix me a minute steak.
LEADMALE:That'll give you nine minutes to spare.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna have to fix your own breakfast today.
SUPMALE:And maybe dinner too.
SUPFEMALE:It might be another late night.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, red light, whoa.
SUPMALE:Stop, kemosabe.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, you want moi to cook? Yeah, you're a big Orkan now.
SUPMALE:I think you can handle yourself in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:And maybe cleaning up around here too.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, Mind, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:I draw the line right there.
LEADMALE:I will not cook, clean or do windows.
LEADFEMALE:I am man.
SUPFEMALE:Watch me sit.
LEADFEMALE:Where'd you get that idea? Robert Petrie, Jim Anderson and Archie Bunker.
SUPFEMALE:- Who? - Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Television.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Mork, that's a lot of bunk.
LEADFEMALE:TV isn't real life.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, are you kidding? Then Ricky really doesn't love Lucy? Look, Mork, since I've been working, I just don't have enough time to do all the things around the house.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna need your help.
LEADMALE:Enlightened Mork to the rescue.
LEADFEMALE:But, please, don't make me cook, because I'll get thinner than Ronald Reagan's environmental budget.
SUPMALE:Look, you travelled I think that you can pour yourself a bowl of cereal.
OTHERMALE:Listen, I gotta run.
SUPMALE:- Well-- - I'll see you later.
LEADMALE:Don't wait up.
OTHERFEMALE:It might be another late night.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:Big kiss, Mindy-- She used to have time for a big kiss.
LEADFEMALE:Now she hasn't even got time to pucker.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, I knew you'd come-- Is the lady of the house at home? Exidor.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, is that you? Hey, what are we doing just standing here talking? Come on in.
OTHERMALE:My, my, my.
SUPMALE:Isn't this a delightful home? Don't rush me, I'll get to the sales pitch.
OTHERMALE:Good morning, sir or madam.
LEADFEMALE:We represent the Exidor-to-Door Company.
LEADFEMALE:Exclusive distributors of these thingamajigs.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Exidor, but I already have a thingamajig.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right.
LEADMALE:I'll tell him what it does.
LEADMALE:And why? Because this miracle of modern technology can do everything a maid can do, except steal the silverware.
LEADMALE:And next week, we're putting out an attachment for that.
LEADMALE:- Amazing.
LEADFEMALE:- Yes.
OTHERMALE:The revolutionary new Maid-O-Matic.
LEADMALE:Exidor, does this really make housework easier? You don't want it? I know, I know.
LEADMALE:Go to the hard sell.
LEADMALE:You buy this gizmo, or you'll never see your wife and kids again.
SUPMALE:- I'm not married.
SUPFEMALE:- We have an attachment for that too.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I should buy this.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy says I should be helping her - with the cooking and cleaning.
LEADMALE:- What? Did you hear that, boys? The skirt's pushing him around.
LEADFEMALE:- No, she isn't.
LEADFEMALE:- Is.
SUPMALE:- Isn't.
LEADFEMALE:- Is.
LEADMALE:The vote is 1 2 to 1 against you.
OTHERMALE:Well, I guess she is.
SUPMALE:But all I wanted to do was make housework easier.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You whimpering washrag.
LEADMALE:Pull yourself together.
LEADMALE:Who wears the pants in this house? You or the tomato? Well, she does.
LEADMALE:But, well, this man's had enough, though.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not gonna let her push me around, because I'm gonna be the best little wifey Mindy ever had.
SUPFEMALE:But I do draw the line at motherhood.
LEADMALE:Boy, housework is a snap.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know what Erma Bombeck's kvetching about all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, here we go.
LEADMALE:Oh, look, brown and black, Mindy's favourite colours.
SUPMALE:She won't mind.
SUPMALE:It could keep the bugs away.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see.
SUPFEMALE:What we do now? Well, I think I'll make a little salad for my breadwinner.
OTHERMALE:There we are.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see, let's see.
OTHERMALE:Instructions.
LEADFEMALE:''Put vegetables inside.
LEADFEMALE:'' All right, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see.
SUPMALE:''Turn on.
LEADFEMALE:'' Wait a minute! Wait! Vesuvius.
SUPFEMALE:Abandon-- Attention boys, abandon ship, abandon ship.
LEADMALE:Save yourself.
LEADMALE:What is going on? Jiminy crickets.
LEADFEMALE:What in the world is going on here, Mork? What are you trying to do, qualify for a federal disaster loan? Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I was just trying to help, and-- It looked easy at the time I was doing it.
LEADFEMALE:Then all of a suddenlike Krypton.
LEADMALE:Well, what did you expect? Housework isn't easy.
LEADMALE:It's miserable, backbreaking, repetitive, unrewarding, non-paying labour.
OTHERMALE:And look what it's done to my hands.
SUPFEMALE:That's horrible.
SUPMALE:They look like lobsters at a tanning salon.
SUPMALE:Quick, call Madge.
LEADMALE:- Mindy made it always look so easy.
LEADMALE:- Well, it isn't.
LEADMALE:And my wife didn't like it either.
LEADMALE:She wanted to get a job, but I laid down the law.
LEADFEMALE:I told her, her job was to cook the meals and take care of the house.
OTHERMALE:After that, we never had another problem.
SUPFEMALE:- Everything was dokey-okey, right? - Wrong.
OTHERMALE:She left me.
SUPFEMALE:You know, and I still miss the static on the TV when she'd vacuum under my feet.
LEADMALE:I don't want Mindy to leave me.
LEADFEMALE:You'd better call her and find out how to run this place before it's too late.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do that right away.
SUPFEMALE:Five, four, three, two, cue music.
SUPMALE:And Welcome to Talk to Dr.

OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Dr.
LEADMALE:Lincoln, I'm so embarrassed.
LEADMALE:I-- I apologise.
LEADFEMALE:It'll never happen again.
LEADMALE:You must think I'm some kind of a loony.
LEADMALE:No, Mindy, but I might suggest that this Mork come see me at the clinic.
OTHERFEMALE:What is it now, Mork? Oh, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Sternhagen.
LEADMALE:Yes, I'll be right in to see you.
OTHERMALE:I knew it was too good to last.
LEADFEMALE:Mork.
SUPMALE:Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Mork? Oh, there is my lovely, mobile career woman.
LEADMALE:Hello, hon.

LEADFEMALE:Hot potato, hot pota-- Nothing says loving like something from the oven.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, I almost lost my job today.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hon, I know work was such a hard, hard thing today.
SUPMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you just sit down now and relax? You just sit down and rest those little tired bones and tootsies.
SUPMALE:- No problem, there.
LEADMALE:- Mork, I don't-- Whoa, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:There's your little pipe.
OTHERMALE:Here's the sports page.
LEADFEMALE:I cut a few recipes out.
OTHERFEMALE:I hope you don't mind.
OTHERFEMALE:And we've got your little slippers here.
LEADFEMALE:Little teddies on them.
LEADFEMALE:Put those on.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know what a hard day it's been for me.
SUPFEMALE:Trying to put a waxy, yellow build-up on that floor.
LEADMALE:Mork, I don't wanna talk about the floor.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna talk about what happened at work today.
LEADMALE:Work, work, work.
SUPFEMALE:That's all you type-A personalities ever wanna talk about.
LEADFEMALE:You don't even think about me.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing to worry about for me.
OTHERFEMALE:You almost got me fired today.
LEADFEMALE:You embarrassed me on the air, and-- And I just want you to promise that it will not happen again.
LEADMALE:So this is the thanks I get for slaving over a hot stove? And working my fingers to the bone? And wasting the best bleams of my life? Oh, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Mork, calm down.
SUPFEMALE:No, you calm down! Here I am in this house cooped up all day, vicariously living through your exploits.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Look, forget-- Forget I ever mentioned anything about it.
SUPFEMALE:Look, we'll sit down, we'll have a nice little dinner, just the two of us.
LEADMALE:You want your dinner, you eat out.
LEADMALE:Mork, come on, you're overreacting.
SUPMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Don't touch me.
LEADFEMALE:I have a headache.
SUPMALE:And always remember, Carol, that one day, your children will be parents too.
LEADFEMALE:And that's when they'll get theirs.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye now.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that wraps up another session.
LEADMALE:So until next time, this is Dr.
LEADMALE:Joni Lincoln hoping that all your problems are little ones.
LEADMALE:Are we still on the air, Mindy? Oh, no, it's over.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, wrap.
LEADFEMALE:Let's wrap.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Dr.
SUPMALE:Lincoln.
LEADMALE:I really am.
LEADMALE:I don't know where my mind has been lately.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mindy, are you all right? You've been forgetting cues, and whenever the phone rings, you cringe.
LEADMALE:I know I'm not supposed to bring my problems to work with me, but it's the guy I live with.
SUPFEMALE:Mork? Well, he's just not adjusting very well to my working.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I don't mean to be laying this all on you.
OTHERMALE:Oh, please, everybody does.
LEADMALE:It's part of the job.
SUPFEMALE:Lay it on me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's just that the two of us Well, I don't know, everything got turned around somehow.
LEADMALE:- And it was pretty weird to begin with.
SUPMALE:- I see.
SUPMALE:Well, Mindy, in any household, when a woman begins a career, there are always gonna be some adjustments.
SUPFEMALE:I know, I went through it with my family.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but Mork has over-adjusted.
SUPMALE:In one day, he went from being Ozzie to Harriet.
OTHERFEMALE:Could be an identity problem.
LEADMALE:Well, Mork shares in the housework, but I wanna help with those responsibilities too.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want him waiting on me hand and foot.
LEADMALE:How long have you been living together? About three years.
SUPMALE:Is your physical relationship compatible? Well, I-- I guess that-- That all depends on what you call ''compatible.
LEADFEMALE:'' I mean, we kiss and, you know-- But we don't You know.
OTHERFEMALE:But-- But we're compatible.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, Mindy, in any relationship, it takes more than one person to make a problem, and we can talk about a number of ways to help improve things.
LEADMALE:But right now, I'd rather you didn't say a word.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Because I think we're still on the air.
LEADMALE:I'll be right in, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Sternhagen.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mork.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's you.
SUPMALE:How nice.
LEADMALE:Did you happen to see the show today? No, I had an exhausting afternoon at the day-care.
LEADMALE:We had an artistic problem.
SUPFEMALE:There was crayon lodged in Mrs.
LEADMALE:Fowler's ear.
SUPMALE:Well, listen.
LEADMALE:Today I had a long conversation with Dr.
LEADMALE:Lincoln about our problems.
LEADFEMALE:Problems? We have no problems.
LEADMALE:We're as happy as two moths on a porch light, you know: - Oh, Mork, no, we're not.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, yes, we are.
LEADMALE:- And I'm part of the problem.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Mind, you know-- Oh, Mind, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:You don't know what it's like to carry this all alone.
LEADMALE:I thought I was an anchor around your neck.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I was a hangnail on the finger of ambition.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, how can we save the shambles of this relationship? Dr.
OTHERFEMALE:Lincoln suggested some ways that would help us to relate better.
LEADMALE:- They're really more like games.
LEADMALE:- Games? Why didn't you say so? I'll be shirts and you be skins.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:They're not those kind of games.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, actually, they're more like exercises in trust.
SUPMALE:- Let's start with a simple one.
LEADMALE:- All right.
LEADFEMALE:- All right, you stand over here.
SUPMALE:- Okay.
SUPFEMALE:- Now, just stand straight.
OTHERMALE:- Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I want you to fall, and I'll catch you.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds reasonable.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Right, I'll go along with this, Mind, but if it doesn't work, I'm walking.
SUPMALE:No, that's what it's about.
SUPMALE:You've gotta trust me.
LEADMALE:- All right.
LEADMALE:- I promise I'll catch you.
LEADFEMALE:- You promise? - I promise.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Custer.
OTHERMALE:Nice catch, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Mork, you were supposed to fall backwards.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna get the hang of it now, Mind.
LEADMALE:- Mind, something's not right here.
SUPFEMALE:- Okay.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:While you're still in one piece, let's try something else that might help us understand each other.
SUPFEMALE:It's called role reversal.
OTHERMALE:It's where I play you and you play me, and then we act out a scene from our normal daily life.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you mean, I'll be Mindy and you'll be Mork? - There are laws against that, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:- No, no.
LEADMALE:- I think it could only help.
SUPFEMALE:- Well, all right.
SUPFEMALE:Well, give me till tomorrow morning to shave my legs.
LEADMALE:I have to pluck my eyebrows and buy some things.
LEADMALE:I'll be back.
LEADFEMALE:- Morning, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- Morning, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, gosh and golly.
SUPFEMALE:Late again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind.
LEADMALE:Will you fix me breakfast? Will you, huh? Will you? I'm so hungry I could eat Bebo.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I haven't got time right now.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm too busy being a butch career girl.
LEADMALE:Hey, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:That's hitting below the belt.
SUPFEMALE:And stop it, you're gonna stretch out my boots.
LEADMALE:These are your boots? I really had to stuff socks in the front.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, you're so talented and handsome, and you have such great taste in clothes.
OTHERMALE:Hey, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:I never said that.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it would be nice if you did once in a while.
LEADMALE:Mork, Mork.
SUPMALE:Where are my car keys? Did you bury them again? Well, I locked them in the jeep so they wouldn't get lost.
SUPFEMALE:Did I do good? Did I? Did I, huh? Do I get gold star? Absolutely not.
LEADMALE:- Mork, come, sit down.
LEADMALE:- Sense of impending doom.
SUPMALE:Now, here we go.
LEADMALE:Let's sit down and talk.
LEADMALE:Not-- Not on your face.
LEADFEMALE:Now, Mork, Mork Mork, I realise you're an alien that doesn't know his elbow from his raznick.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, but I never would've done it without your patience and understanding.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, really? Phone.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? It's Mr.
LEADMALE:Sternhagen, my boss.
LEADMALE:Yes, Mr.
SUPMALE:Sternhagen? Yes, I'm still here.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:No, I-- I-- I have a little jeep problem.
LEADFEMALE:You're right, that's no reason to lose my job.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Bye, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Sternhagen.
LEADFEMALE:Good news? I have to be at the station in ten minutes or I'm off the air forever.
LEADMALE:All right, here.
LEADMALE:You just have to fix yourself breakfast, and I'll be home before midnight.
SUPMALE:But-- But-- But, Mind Wait a minute, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Don't leave without giving me a big-- Kiss? I've been ignoring you, haven't I? Well, who could blame you? I didn't realise I was that hard to live with.
LEADMALE:As a roommate, I'm no John Ritter.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, you're terrific.
LEADMALE:Different, but terrific.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, our lives are changing, and we just have to do a better job of changing with them.
OTHERFEMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:From now on, I'm only gonna do my share.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, housework is really hard.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna try not to use so much of myself up at the office that I have nothing left to give to you.
SUPMALE:See, I feel better already.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna have to promise each other that we'll always tell each other how we're feeling.
SUPFEMALE:You got it.
SUPFEMALE:I feel happy now.
SUPMALE:- Well, that's good.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah, and now, I feel happier.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, really? - Now it feels like almost joy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it is joy.
OTHERFEMALE:Goodbye, joy, hello, ecstasy.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, anybody home? Mork, l love what you've done with your hair.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, Orson.
LEADMALE:Sir, it's me, Mindy McConnell.
OTHERFEMALE:Remember me? I was here a few months ago with Mork-- Silence.
SUPFEMALE:Where is Mork? What's happened to his report? Oh, well, sir, you see, Mork and I started sharing all our responsibilities lately, so here I am.
LEADFEMALE:But if you'd really rather speak to Mork, I could go get-- Just get on with it.
LEADMALE:Oh, okay.
SUPFEMALE:See, my report is really about my and Mork's relationship.
LEADMALE:Again? Wh--? He told you about it? - What did he say? - Everything.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he couldn't have, sir, because a good relationship is always changing and growing.
LEADMALE:But if a relationship works well, why would you want to change it? Well, sometimes there's no choice.
LEADMALE:I mean, you never know what hurdles life is gonna place in front of you.
LEADMALE:And each one is a test of how much you care.
LEADFEMALE:And sometimes, even if you don't have trouble getting over them, your partner may.
OTHERFEMALE:So you either stop and help them over or you go on alone.
SUPFEMALE:- Did I do all right? - Not bad for an Earthling.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's big of you, sir.
SUPFEMALE:No, I-- No, I didn't mean ''big.
LEADFEMALE:'' I meant, that's good of you, sir.
LEADMALE:Did--? Maybe we can do this again sometime soon.
LEADFEMALE:Don't press your luck.
SUPMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Well, this is Mindy McConnell signing off for Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, attention, everybody.
SUPMALE:I would like to propose a toast to Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley on his birthday.
SUPFEMALE:Happy birthday, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Bickley.
SUPMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Happy Bickday, Birth.
LEADFEMALE:My colleagues and moi have created the world's first Mork-O-Gram.
LEADMALE:utilising the letters of your name.
SUPMALE:Ready? B is for the buddy that you've always been to me.
LEADFEMALE:I is for the illusions you shattered.
SUPMALE:Like when you told me the Easter bunny has rabies.
SUPFEMALE:C is for cake.
LEADFEMALE:When do we eat? Why isn't this working out like I planned? All right, Morkettes.
LEADFEMALE:Plan B.
OTHERMALE:Happy 50, Bicky.
SUPMALE:That's terrific.
LEADFEMALE:Would the Morkettes like a piece of cake? No, thanks, Mindy.
SUPMALE:The moment was enough for me.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, little munchkins.
SUPFEMALE:I'll bring some cake to you at the day-care centre tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:You'd better, buster, or I just may forget I'm a lady.
LEADMALE:That was really sweet of those little girls.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, Mork.
LEADMALE:I didn't have the heart to tell them I was only 49.
LEADMALE:Forty-nine? Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:We called your son Tom, and he said you were 50.
LEADMALE:Oh, he confuses me with Paul Newman.
SUPMALE:Look, I'll show you my driver's license.
LEADFEMALE:That will prove conclusively that I'm really only There, you s Oh, my God, I am 50.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, welcome to the half-century club.
SUPFEMALE:So we're 50, so what? At 50, our lives are just beginning.
LEADMALE:Yes, if you were a tortoise, you'd be just a baby.
LEADMALE:And if you were an elephant, you'd be a teenager.
LEADFEMALE:And if you were a dog, you'd be dead.
SUPMALE:I feel like I've lost a whole year.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I'm 50.
LEADFEMALE:All those things I've never done.
SUPFEMALE:- What kind of things? - You know, stuff you put off.
LEADMALE:Like, well, I've never read the entire Bible.
OTHERMALE:I've never seen the Grand Canyon or Niagara Falls.
LEADFEMALE:You know what really gets me? I never told my son the facts of life.
LEADFEMALE:- How old is he? - Twenty-seven.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he's probably still up.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you give him a call? I'll bet he's with some girl, wondering what to do.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody ever had to tell me the facts of life.
LEADMALE:- Guys know, right, Mork? - Hey, yo, yo, yo.
LEADFEMALE:Let's face it.
LEADMALE:I'm an old man.
SUPFEMALE:So many things I should've done and didn't do.
SUPMALE:Opportunity raced by and left me sniffing its exhaust.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mr.
SUPMALE:Bickley.
SUPMALE:Don't be so hard on yourself.
LEADMALE:I mean, regrets have nothing to do with age.
SUPMALE:We all have them.
LEADMALE:You know, things we didn't do, things we should have done.
SUPMALE:Oh, regrets.
LEADMALE:I've had a few, but I've handled them my way.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, what could you possibly have to regret, you little pixie pants? Well, oh, bless you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the fact that, well, my foot doesn't have a thumb, that my ears don't spin in the wind, that I'll never find out who Rula Lenska was.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you know what might be really interesting tonight? lf we all shared our regrets with everybody else.
OTHERMALE:It'll help Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley.
LEADFEMALE:And we'll all get to know each other a lot better.
OTHERMALE:Oh, please say yes.
LEADFEMALE:I'm for anything that'll help poor old Mr.
OTHERMALE:Bickley.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, it's your apartment.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you go first? lt's always her apartment.
LEADMALE:I live here too.
OTHERMALE:I only regret that I don't have her clout.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, what is it that you regret most in your life? Oh, I'd really rather not go first.
SUPFEMALE:You know, kind of shy and all.
LEADMALE:Would anyone like some coffee? Oh, curiosity at her strange evasion.
LEADMALE:Well, then, I'll go first.
LEADFEMALE:Why did I say that? This is going to be embarrassing.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, go for it, Jeanie.
LEADFEMALE:Well What I most regret in life has to do with a man named Tony.
LEADFEMALE:I remember him.
SUPMALE:He was a big guy, almost 5'8''.
OTHERMALE:He really knew how to talk to me.
SUPMALE:I was kind of quiet and shy, and I really didn't think very much of myself at the time.
LEADFEMALE:But what I saw in Tony's eyes was so much nicer than anything I'd ever seen in my own mirror.
LEADMALE:Can you imagine having somebody make you feel that special? How long did you and this Tony go together? Two months Before I found out he was married.
OTHERMALE:Married? You mean he was cheating on you? Now, wait a second, that guy, Tony, you dated him over a year.
SUPMALE:- That's my regret.
SUPMALE:- Oh, I can't believe this.
LEADMALE:My little sister playing Dallas in the Bronx.
SUPFEMALE:- Mindy, would you like to go next? - Oh, I'd rather not.
LEADMALE:You know, Nelson's dying to go next.
LEADMALE:- He is? - Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I bet the only he regrets is his little pink eyes can't stand this much light.
OTHERFEMALE:Actually, my biggest regret is that Glenda stiff-armed me at the drive-in last night.
LEADMALE:I told you, that's not where the popcorn dropped.
LEADMALE:Come on, Nelson, there must be something in that albino soul of yours that you wanna let out of there.
SUPMALE:Let it out, let it fly.
LEADMALE:Open up, open up, open up.
LEADMALE:Yeah, make us cry.
LEADMALE:Well, there is something.
LEADFEMALE:It's been haunting me for years.
LEADFEMALE:- I was 1 5-- - That's a good one.
LEADMALE:Who's next? And every morning, I'd take the bus to school, the Number 26 bus.
SUPFEMALE:One morning, she gets on.
OTHERFEMALE:She had the prettiest blond hair I'd ever seen, besides my own.
LEADMALE:She took my breath away.
OTHERFEMALE:I watched her as she sat down.
LEADMALE:About the same distance as Mork is sitting now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really? Kind of like this? I couldn't take my eyes off her.
LEADMALE:I kept staring at her, thinking, ''I've gotta meet this person.
SUPFEMALE:'' But before I could think of how to approach her, the bus stopped and she got up to leave.
LEADMALE:She passed in front of me on the way to the exit.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
OTHERMALE:She smiled politely and Got off the bus.
SUPMALE:My heart was pounding.
LEADMALE:I wanted to meet her and get to know her so bad.
LEADMALE:All I had to do was follow her off the bus and say hello, but I just sat there.
LEADFEMALE:The bus pulled away.
OTHERFEMALE:I watched her through the window.
LEADMALE:I saw her grow smaller and smaller in the distance.
LEADMALE:There went my dream.
LEADMALE:All right, well, now, who's gonna go next? Mindy? Oh, I'd really like to, but I have to get the ice cream for the cake.
LEADMALE:I'll go warm up the ketchup.
OTHERMALE:Mind, Mind, I sense a certain aversion to airing your regret.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, am I right, am I wrong? Why do I ask another question? There, I did it again, but Oh, Mork, it's just that it's very personal.
SUPMALE:I'd really rather tell you when we're alone.
LEADMALE:Our sense of intimacy grows.
LEADFEMALE:Well, ever since I was a little girl, I wanted to be a dancer.
LEADFEMALE:I always heard music in my head, and my body just seemed to wanna move to it.
SUPFEMALE:I started with ballet when I was about 5, and I just loved it so much.
OTHERFEMALE:And one day my father said to me, ''Where's the newspaper?'' And I said, ''Over there.
OTHERMALE:'' Then I fell on my tutu.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, after the ballet, there was tap and jazz and modern, and I just felt so free.
OTHERMALE:And then Randolph came into my life.
LEADMALE:And, you know, he loved to dance just as much as I did.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think our feet touched the ground for our entire marriage.
SUPFEMALE:And then I was alone.
OTHERMALE:And I haven't felt like dancing since.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not right to close off a part of you, is it? Glenda Faye, would you dance with me? Oh, you mean now? Well, I've got the music in me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, I don't think so.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:- Sure, come on.
SUPMALE:- No, no.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, my dad's got a barn.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:- Come on.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, no.
SUPMALE:Music, minstrel.
LEADMALE:Well, my regret is that women only want me for my body.
LEADFEMALE:What? Wanna trade regrets? It's not funny, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley.
SUPFEMALE:It's a curse I've had to live with.
SUPMALE:Girls only see me as a plaything.
LEADMALE:I have a mind too, you know.
LEADMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, when I'm on a date, all I hear is: ''Remo, make a muscle.
OTHERFEMALE:Remo, make a muscle.
LEADFEMALE:'' You know how cheap this makes me feel? Hey, look, at heart, I'm an old-fashioned guy.
OTHERMALE:I don't know, these days, all women wanna do is grope, grope, grope.
SUPMALE:I'm tired of being a phone number passed around at the beauty parlour.
LEADFEMALE:You understand, don't you, Mr.
SUPMALE:McConnell? I want a relationship.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry, Remo, but he's already married.
SUPMALE:I can't help that God built me this way.
LEADFEMALE:You know how it feels when a woman looks at my shirt, and then whispers to her girlfriend, ''I wonder if they're real''? Tragic.
SUPMALE:I don't know, I just pray that somewhere, there's some woman sensitive enough to, I don't know, see beyond this classic shell of a man.
LEADMALE:I want her to discover the real Remo, to reach out for me.
LEADMALE:I wanna be talked to, I wanna be held.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm sure there's someone out there somewhere.
SUPMALE:I just hope she's built.
LEADMALE:Yo, yo, yo.
SUPFEMALE:All right, who hasn't spilled his guts yet? Let's see, I think it's Mr.
LEADFEMALE:McConnell and Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, will you go next? Come on, Pops, tell them about the time you were sold into bald slavery.
OTHERMALE:Well, there is something I've lived with for quite some time.
LEADMALE:Even Mindy doesn't know about it.
LEADFEMALE:Really? What is it? It happened November 24th, 1 950.
LEADFEMALE:In Korea.
LEADMALE:lt was late.
LEADFEMALE:We were on patrol.
LEADFEMALE:I remember trudging through the frozen mud in a miserable 5 below.
SUPMALE:Suddenly, the sky lit up with incoming shells, and we all scattered into the woods.
SUPMALE:I'd never seen trees broken off at the top before.
SUPMALE:Or men either.
LEADMALE:Now, the shelling stopped, and I was surrounded by an eerie silence.
SUPMALE:Just then, I heard the frozen mud crunch behind me.
LEADMALE:I looked around, and I saw somebody charging me with a fixed bayonet.
LEADFEMALE:Before he could get to me, I raised my rifle and I shot him.
LEADMALE:And he flew back into a shell hole, dead.
LEADMALE:Mindy, I killed a man.
OTHERMALE:Oh, but, Dad, you had to.
SUPMALE:He would've killed you.
SUPMALE:He was the enemy, Uncle Fred.
LEADFEMALE:When he's three feet away, he's another human being.
OTHERMALE:The look on his face as his life left him There are nights when I still see it.
LEADMALE:I just wish I didn't have to pull that trigger.
LEADMALE:If you didn't, Fred, you wouldn't be here with us.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and you never would've had Mindy.
LEADMALE:Mork, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and I would probably be living with Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley.
OTHERFEMALE:Then I'd really have a regret to share with you all.
SUPMALE:My, some of these regrets are heavy.
LEADFEMALE:You know, but they make me feel so much closer to all of you tonight.
SUPMALE:It feels really very good.
LEADMALE:I never knew exposing myself was such a warm experience.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's been an interesting party, but it's past my bedtime.
LEADMALE:Hey, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Mindy, you haven't told us your regret.
LEADMALE:- Come on, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah, that's right.
SUPMALE:- Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yeah, Mindy, come on.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:She has no regrets.
SUPMALE:She's led a perfect life, thanks to me and her Lady Remington.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you see, I really can't - The door.
LEADMALE:The door.
OTHERMALE:- Regrettus interruptus.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:- Mork, is that you? - It's me, Exidor.
SUPMALE:No, I'm Exidor, you're Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Who is that? - Exidor, the town loon.
LEADFEMALE:I resent that, Curly.
SUPMALE:I don't live in town.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm a Valley guy.
LEADFEMALE:I bring bad news, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:It's not going to be easy.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd better sit down.
OTHERFEMALE:I just got back from the doctor.
SUPMALE:- Which doctor? - Exactly.
SUPFEMALE:He told me in Swahili I've only got 41 years to live.
OTHERMALE:Here's his note describing my condition.
LEADFEMALE:''Your mama.
SUPMALE:'' For goodness' sakes, Exidor, Easy for you to say, cue ball, you've got your health.
SUPMALE:I'm about to punch out.
LEADMALE:That's why I plan to spend my last waning moments here in this house, with my dearest friends.
LEADFEMALE:Imagine our excitement.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll just lie down unobtrusively.
SUPFEMALE:All of you vital people just go on with whatever you were doing.
SUPMALE:Okay, Mindy, what are your regrets? What? Remo, there is a man in a robe lying on us.
OTHERFEMALE:I couldn't help overhearing.
LEADFEMALE:What's this garbage about regrets? We're telling each other things we regret the most.
LEADMALE:Oh, I've got one.
SUPMALE:Besides the fact that Whitey here's got boney knees.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Mork, I've been feeling really down in the dumps since my wife left me.
LEADFEMALE:You must've been awfully shocked when she bit through the leash and got away.
SUPMALE:I was feeling really low there for a while.
LEADFEMALE:I even let my appearance go.
LEADMALE:And then, as fate would have it, I became attached to another woman.
OTHERFEMALE:Deeply attached.
LEADFEMALE:My regret is that I haven't told her my feelings.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, then by all means, go and tell her now.
SUPMALE:Should I, Mork? Should I run to her and risk rejection, not to mention mono? Yes, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Go to her.
LEADFEMALE:Let your heart fly like a moth into a blowtorch.
LEADMALE:I love you, my sweet.
SUPMALE:I wanna have your baby! Oh, no.
LEADMALE:No way, not me.
SUPFEMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye, Whitey, Shorty, Curly.
LEADMALE:You too, Perky.
LEADMALE:You know, Mork, you're the only one here with a normal name.
SUPMALE:Well, I hate to admit it, but this has been the best 50-year-old birthday party I've ever had.
SUPFEMALE:And you've all helped me learn something here tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Age has nothing to do with regrets.
LEADFEMALE:I can do all those things I've always wanted to do starting tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Who the hell's stopping me? - Right, yeah.
LEADMALE:- Come on.
LEADMALE:But tonight, I need my rest.
SUPMALE:I've got 50 years of living starting tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Come on, Frankie, let's see if we can beat these kids to the door.
SUPFEMALE:- Come on.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, the guest of honour is leaving.
SUPMALE:It doesn't take the roof to fall in on my head.
LEADMALE:I know the party's over.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry I didn't get to hear your regret, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, it'll keep.
SUPMALE:- Thank you.
SUPMALE:- Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:- Bye, thanks for coming.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:- Real nice to have friends, huh? - Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:- See you.
LEADFEMALE:- Bye, Remo.
LEADMALE:Yo, yo, yo.
LEADMALE:All right, Mind, you can tell me now.
LEADFEMALE:What was your regret? Come on, now.
LEADMALE:Come on, come on, come on.
LEADMALE:Okay, okay, let me sit down.
OTHERMALE:My regret is that my mother had to die before she got a chance to meet you.
SUPMALE:See, I couldn't say that in front of everybody, because then I'd have to explain that I wanted her to know everything about you, and Well, the fact I came from another planet and everything.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:And that you're as close to me as she was.
LEADMALE:And that you're the most important thing in my life.
OTHERFEMALE:Deeply moved.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my mom would've liked you, Mork, I just know it.
SUPMALE:- I would've liked her too.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I know what I would've said to her too.
LEADMALE:- You do? - Sure.
LEADMALE:Hello, Mrs.
LEADMALE:McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:That's my way of saying shalom.
OTHERMALE:No, ma'am, I don't live around here, I live here.
OTHERFEMALE:With Mindy, yes, ma'am.
LEADMALE:Well, we're very close.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, not that close.
LEADMALE:I don't even know what that is.
SUPMALE:You see, ma'am, I'm a creature from another planet.
LEADMALE:You know: You know, like Alien.
LEADFEMALE:Except that I'm cuter, and I don't skitter across the floor like that.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yes, ma'am, I'm single.
SUPMALE:You know, if it wasn't for Mindy taking in strays, I would never have a place to be.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanna thank you for bringing her into this world.
LEADMALE:Do I love her? Well I wanna give her everything I have and spend the rest of my life with her.
SUPMALE:Is that love? You know, it's kind of funny that I had to come millions of miles to find something deep inside of me.
SUPFEMALE:I wonder if she feels the same way.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I guess you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I should ask her myself.
SUPMALE:Thank you, ma'am.
LEADMALE:Thank you very much.
OTHERMALE:I like you too.
SUPFEMALE:That's what I would've said to your mom.
LEADFEMALE:I had a feeling you were trying to say something to me too.
OTHERMALE:Mork, was my mother really here? She told me to give you something.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:I love you too, Mork.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Na-no, na-no.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I gotta go, Mork.
OTHERMALE:Keep your fingers crossed for me.
SUPMALE:Or whatever you Orkans do for luck.
LEADMALE:Oh, look at all the flowers.
OTHERMALE:Mork, the room looks beautiful.
OTHERMALE:I know, Mind, and not a single Medfly in the bunch.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:- Titter, titter, blush, blush, blush.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, this is so sweet of you to do this for me.
SUPMALE:But you're a little premature.
OTHERMALE:I'm not gonna know about the newscaster job till this afternoon.
SUPFEMALE:But thanks.
SUPMALE:Oh, down, boy.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, down, boy, down, boy.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind Go ahead tell her.
LEADFEMALE:No, I can't.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, tell her.
LEADMALE:Tell her.
LEADFEMALE:I can't.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, tell her.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm cramping up emotionally.
LEADMALE:Just tell her.
OTHERFEMALE:You can do it.
LEADFEMALE:Tell her, tell her Mork, I'm gonna have to wait later.
LEADMALE:Sorry, wait.
SUPMALE:I'm Oh, wait.
SUPMALE:Just tell her.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell her.
SUPFEMALE:It's okay.
OTHERFEMALE:It's all right.
OTHERMALE:Mindy, you hold my three hearts in your two hands.
LEADFEMALE:Basically, what I'd like to say is, will you marry me, Mind? Mind? The shiksa split.
SUPFEMALE:Make a small mental note: It's always better to propose while she's in the room.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork? - Mind, oh, you say the magic words.
LEADFEMALE:Roast.
SUPMALE:Don't forget to put it in the oven.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:All that love for a hunk of meat.
LEADMALE:I blew my big moment.
SUPFEMALE:I was there.
SUPFEMALE:I blew it.
SUPMALE:Fore! This is not the American embassy! Mind if I play through? Exidor, is that you? That's what it says on my scorecard.
LEADMALE:Try a five iron? Pepe, that's why you're a caddy and I'm on the tour.
OTHERFEMALE:I always like playing this course.
LEADFEMALE:So well-tended.
SUPMALE:Those are for Mindy.
SUPMALE:I tried to propose to her.
LEADMALE:- What did she say? - Put the roast in the oven.
SUPMALE:So that's where it goes.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you can join me on my crusade.
SUPMALE:I'm going to take golf from the rich and give it to the poor.
LEADMALE:We'll play in the streets with real hazards, like gang violence and mopeds.
SUPMALE:Exidor, you've got to help me, please.
SUPMALE:I mean, you know everything.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you even know the color of Ronald Reagan's real hair.
SUPMALE:Please, please, how do? How do I propose to Mindy? Ditch the skirt, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, but I love Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't marriage the ultimate commitment, the eternal bond, besides a wicked tax break? It's a sham.
LEADFEMALE:- It's a blessing.
LEADMALE:- It's barbaric.
LEADFEMALE:- It's fulfilling.
LEADFEMALE:- It's a candy mint.
LEADFEMALE:- It's a breath mint.
LEADMALE:- Oh, stop.
LEADFEMALE:We're both right.
SUPFEMALE:Exidor, please, please, pull out your putter and drive me out of this sand trap of life into the fairway of love.
LEADMALE:Mork, there's only two ways to propose.
SUPMALE:B, the old-fashioned way.
LEADFEMALE:You charge into her life on a fiery white stallion, toss the tomato on the back of the saddle and ride off into the sunset.
LEADFEMALE:I guess the old-fashioned way is always best unless you're having a heart transplant, but Well, then you're stuck with C.
LEADMALE:- I don't mean to pry, but what's C? - Hmm? - C? - Oh, C.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mork, I must say that it's a boring choice, but it worked for Prince Charles.
OTHERFEMALE:I look a lot less like Howdy Doody than he does.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:This may shock and even nauseate you.
OTHERMALE:That's all right.
SUPMALE:I subscribe to the National Enquirer.
LEADMALE:Bunny, I may not be the handsomest man, or the brightest, or the wealthiest man in the world, but I've got his phone number.
LEADMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see.
SUPMALE:Did she come in yet? Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:On your mark, get set, propose.
LEADMALE:- Mindy, l - You know, sometimes I wish I was the garbage man, when they wake up in the morning, they expect the world to stink.
LEADMALE:Mind, although we've only known each other now for 26,802 hours, I feel basically Well, I didn't get the newscaster job.
LEADMALE:But am I bitter? No.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Sternhagen said it had nothing to do with my being a woman, it's just that he needed a shortstop for the station's softball team.
LEADMALE:Mind It's hard to propose to a moving target.
OTHERMALE:Mind.
LEADMALE:- Mindy - Oh, I gotta get my mind off this.
LEADFEMALE:I know, let's go do something fun.
OTHERFEMALE:You wanna play tennis? - Oh, l - Or we'll do anything.
SUPMALE:I'd love to play "Space Invaders.
LEADMALE:" Go for some pizza, maybe get married.
OTHERFEMALE:No, we had Italian food last night.
SUPFEMALE:Cute, but not the greatest attention span.
OTHERFEMALE:Eenie, meenie, minie, mo, you die.
OTHERFEMALE:- Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:- Mind, you know, I've traveled all around the galaxy, and I never thought I'd fall for an Earthling.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I don't think I know a nicer or kinder being than you.
LEADMALE:I love you very much, and will you marry me? Mind? Hon, don't check out without the baggage.
OTHERMALE:Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Mind.
LEADMALE:Little Pooter.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:Mind.
SUPMALE:Hello, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:- What's wrong with Mindy? - I don't know, Grams.
LEADMALE:All I did was ask her to marry me and, boom, she's got the personality of lint.
SUPFEMALE:- Marry? - Yes, sir, I think Marry my daughter? Oh, yes, thank you for your blessing.
LEADMALE:Blessing? I'll give you a blessing.
OTHERFEMALE:Wouldn't hit a man standing behind a woman wearing glasses, would you? Married.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I think that we three should have a talk right now.
OTHERFEMALE:- Come on.
LEADFEMALE:- Okay.
LEADMALE:I don't think we should neglect Mindy like this.
LEADFEMALE:- Honey, come on.
OTHERMALE:- Hi, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Pops, wherever Mindy goes, I go, because basically we're a unit, right? Okay, but since we're almost family, I can make one exception.
SUPFEMALE:Now, honey, let me see if I can I can say this tactfully.
LEADFEMALE:Mork is an alien.
LEADMALE:He's an extraterrestrial being.
LEADFEMALE:A UFO with legs.
OTHERMALE:Oh, pipe down, Fredzo.
SUPMALE:You don't mind having that alien sit on your television so you can bring in A television antenna is one thing, a son-in-law is another.
LEADFEMALE:Don't talk to me about a son-in-law.
OTHERMALE:Come on, you two.
OTHERMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Technically, we all know Mork isn't exactly human, but he has a lot more humanity in him than anyone I've ever met.
LEADFEMALE:He's sweet, he's charming, he's sensitive, and I love him.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Mindy, you loved Oliver too, but you got over him.
LEADFEMALE:Oliver was a goldfish.
OTHERMALE:And he went belly-up.
SUPFEMALE:Will you talk some sense into him, please? Oh, Mindy dear, we all love Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, and we don't mind if he still likes to chase cars or sit on his face, but you see, you mustn't let love spoil your judgment.
OTHERFEMALE:Mindy, any mixed marriage is rough.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, but I'm afraid this one is impossible.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, look at the facts.
LEADMALE:Mork can never support you.
SUPFEMALE:So I'll be the breadwinner.
OTHERMALE:I want a career.
OTHERFEMALE:What happens to your career if he's transferred to another planet? I'll commute.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, think.
LEADFEMALE:Mork is an Orkan and he's aging backwards.
LEADFEMALE:You'll be on Medicare, he'll be on pablum.
OTHERMALE:Dear, you will never be able to have a normal life.
SUPFEMALE:And what about having a family? The chances are, you can't.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy, we don't like to see you cheated out of having something as precious as children.
LEADMALE:Honey, it's your decision, and we just want you to be realistic.
SUPMALE:And sometimes that's the hardest thing in the world.
SUPFEMALE:I always thought my life would be like a Doris Day movie, not Barbarella.
OTHERFEMALE:How do I weigh what I feel against what I know is logical? Honey, I think you know exactly what has to be done.
LEADFEMALE:Will you folks talk a little louder? I can't hear a word you're saying! This is gonna be a lot harder than it was to flush Oliver down the toilet.
OTHERFEMALE:Mind, you've been in there all night.
LEADFEMALE:Are you gonna come out? Yes.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:She said, "Yes.
SUPMALE:" Mind, Mind, Mind.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, Mind, Mind, Mind, look.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork.
SUPMALE:Wait, wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, it's a beautiful ring.
LEADMALE:- Look at the jewels, they're sparkling.
OTHERMALE:- Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:- They're glittering.
SUPMALE:- Mm-hm.
SUPFEMALE:- They're moving.
OTHERMALE:- Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Those are his eyes.
LEADFEMALE:He's blinking.
LEADFEMALE:- Him? He's alive? - Yep.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't do that.
LEADMALE:You'll give him whiplash.
OTHERFEMALE:See, the nice thing about it is, if you drop it, he'll follow you home.
SUPMALE:It's a very nice ring, but I can't accept it.
LEADMALE:You don't want the engagement ring? - Oh, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Mind? It's not the ring.
SUPMALE:See, Mork, sometimes in life, no matter how much you dream or you wish for something, it just can't be.
LEADFEMALE:I guess what I'm really trying to say is, I can't marry you.
LEADMALE:Pshaw, Mind, it's a joke, right, like the volunteer Army? Rejection.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:You don't wanna be Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Mork? Mind, Mind, Mind, but Mind, will you give me one reason why we can't get married, bicker, and learn to play canasta for the rest of our lives? I can't lie to you, and it really hurts me to have to say this.
LEADMALE:- It's because you're an alien.
SUPMALE:- And? And? And that's it.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you see? We're from two completely different worlds.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, Mind, that never affected, like, Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier.
LEADMALE:I mean, Pocahontas and John Smith, or Mickey Rooney and pick-a-number.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, come on now.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, I'm not gonna give up.
LEADMALE:- No way, like glue, I'm stuck on you.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, come on.
SUPMALE:Deep down inside, you know there's probably a barrier that shouldn't be crossed.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but you said you loved me, you know, love me.
LEADMALE:You know, L-O-V-V.
SUPMALE:Mork, I said that and I meant it, but I'm sorry, my mind is made up.
LEADMALE:Oh, but, Mind, you took more time to make up your mind about your bathroom wallpaper.
SUPMALE:I mean more to you than that, don't I? You do.
SUPMALE:Well, just Well, just take some time, you know? I mean, just 24 hours.
LEADMALE:Please, Mind, Mind, Mind, please.
LEADMALE:Please, oh, please, oh, please All right.
LEADMALE:Tell you what, tell you what.
LEADFEMALE:It's 11:59 now.
SUPMALE:Because I like what you stand for even when you're sitting, I'll give you the extra minute and make it midnight tomorrow night.
LEADMALE:Okay, but I can't promise anything.
LEADFEMALE:- Right.
OTHERFEMALE:- All right.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Remember, you changed your mind about the wallpaper.
LEADMALE:Mork promo, take one.
LEADFEMALE:You will marry Mork.
OTHERMALE:You love Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Mork loves you.
LEADFEMALE:Mork is great.
LEADFEMALE:He's a today kind of guy.
SUPFEMALE:Lock up when you leave.
SUPFEMALE:- Jake? - Hmm? Let's have a heart-to-heart talk.
LEADFEMALE:You and I haven't had one for a long time.
SUPMALE:We never had one.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then I guess we're overdue.
OTHERFEMALE:See, I have this really important decision that I have to make in about two hours.
SUPFEMALE:Now, logically, I know what the answer should be, but emotionally, I feel exactly the opposite.
LEADMALE:You've been around for a while.
LEADMALE:What do you usually do? Do you think with your head or with your heart? Mindy, a lot of people think of me as just old Jake the cameraman, that I care about nothing except staying in focus and going home early.
LEADMALE:They think I don't care about anybody else's problems because nobody cares about mine.
OTHERMALE:Well, you know something? They're right.
SUPFEMALE:Never did like Old Jake.
SUPMALE:Mork, what are you doing? Mind, I've come to sweep you off your feet.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:- Give me your foot.
OTHERFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:Ugh.
OTHERMALE:Big lunch, Mind? This is ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's romantic.
SUPMALE:We're gonna ride off into the sunset.
LEADFEMALE:The sun set four hours ago.
LEADMALE:I guess we better haul it then.
LEADMALE:- Mork - Mind, Mind, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mork! That's all right, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I'll catch the next one.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you really topped yourself that time, Mork.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I guess you've never ridden a pony through a car wash before, huh? Boy, he scampered when he hit that hot wax.
SUPFEMALE:You haven't had a date like that with an earthman.
SUPMALE:You're right there.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, it's almost midnight.
LEADMALE:I think we should sit down and talk.
OTHERMALE:Mind, there's enough time for the grand finale.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, you don't need a finale.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I sure do, and you'll love this.
LEADMALE:Put the tape in the tape recorder down there, please.
SUPMALE:- This one marked Last Ditch Effort? - That's it.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, you've given me flowers and perfume and horses.
LEADFEMALE:What's left? Broadway! Hit it, Mind.
LEADMALE:Got my top hat Got my vest pressed All I need now is the girl Got my striped tie Got my hopes high Got the time and the place And I've got rhythm All I need now is the girl to go with Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, ho.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, they really screwed this game up when they added the ball, Mind.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, no, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Mind.
LEADMALE:You see this guy This guy's in love with you Seriously, where are you from? Yes, I'm in love What do I do to make you mine? You know it.
LEADMALE:Tell me now Is it so? Don't let me be the last to know Because I want to be happy But I won't be happy Till I make you happy too Oh, no, Mindy, no.
LEADFEMALE:Life's really worth living When you are mirth givin' Why can't I give some to you? You know it's true, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork.
SUPMALE:Did I close out of town? Oh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Before I met you, the biggest choice I had to make in my life was whether to have my hair permed or fix the cat.
SUPFEMALE:This is the hardest decision I've ever had to make.
SUPMALE:Maybe the decision's been made for you, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, think about it.
SUPFEMALE:I crossed five galaxies, came to this little tiny planet and out of all those people in the world, you found me and we fell in love.
LEADFEMALE:Coincidence? I say nay.
LEADMALE:Maybe some infinite intelligence in this cosmos as we peer out, realizes that we were meant to be married and all mankind.
LEADFEMALE:I wish I could believe that.
LEADMALE:I wish you could believe that too, Mind.
LEADMALE:I'll send by Exidor to pick up my clothes.
SUPFEMALE:Why? You don't have to go.
LEADMALE:I don't want you to go.
LEADMALE:You could go, but the lease is in your name.
LEADMALE:Just because we can't be married doesn't mean we have to end our relationship.
OTHERMALE:I mean, why can't we just go on being the way we are? I love you.
SUPFEMALE:I couldn't stay here knowing that you'll never be mine.
LEADMALE:But it doesn't have to be like that.
LEADFEMALE:If it were the other way around, could you stay? No.
SUPMALE:Well, big kiss.
LEADMALE:I know how easily you run down, so don't skip breakfast.
SUPMALE:And don't forget to take your Femiron.
LEADMALE:- Mork.
SUPMALE:- Yeah? Goodbye.
LEADMALE:Mork.
OTHERMALE:You don't want me to go, do you? You can read minds too? No, but I can read your face.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, if I married you, I'd be giving up any chance I might have to have a normal life.
OTHERMALE:But if I lost you - Will you marry me? - What? Will you marry me? This is so sudden.
SUPMALE:I'll need some time.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Your Battle of the Bulgeness.
LEADMALE:- Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Sir.
SUPMALE:Do you always have to report when I'm eating? Well, sir, I could wait, but the Earth's sun does have a limited lifespan.
SUPMALE:After that comment, you'd better have an interesting report.
LEADMALE:Well, sir, you're gonna decorate me for this one.
LEADMALE:You see, Mindy and I have signed up for a full lifetime term in the most noble of all institutions, marriage.
LEADMALE:What? Sir? Do I detect a note of jealousy or are you coughing on a bone? Mork, no Orkan has entered into a marriage since our dark ages.
LEADFEMALE:You've broken one of our most fundamental Orkan laws.
LEADMALE:Correct the matter at once.
LEADFEMALE:All right, sir.
LEADFEMALE:I'll correct the problem.
OTHERMALE:I quit.
LEADMALE:I abdicate my post for the woman I love.
SUPMALE:Mork, you can't abdicate.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm giving you an order.
LEADMALE:- Carry it out or else.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, yeah? I'm marrying Mindy and you just try and stop me.
OTHERMALE:That's a nice try there, sir.
OTHERMALE:Don't you understand though? On Earth when man and woman love each other - Silence! - Sir.
SUPFEMALE:The matter is closed.
LEADMALE:Until next week, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Na-no.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, all right.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:The old silent treatment, eh? I am staying right on this spot until you let me marry Mindy.
OTHERMALE:I have patience.
LEADFEMALE:I can wait.
LEADFEMALE:I once sat through an entire Bobby Vinton concert.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:Na-no, na-no.
LEADMALE:Here, Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Put this on your forehead.
LEADFEMALE:No, dear.
LEADMALE:I'm feeling better now.
OTHERFEMALE:All I want is a glass of water and a small Scotch.
LEADFEMALE:It's 9:00 in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not gonna serve you Scotch.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, yes.
LEADMALE:You're right, dear.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:Got any tequila? Oh, Mindy, I'll be all right.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that I was so shocked at your changing your mind and deciding to marry Mork.
SUPFEMALE:But, dear, if that is what you want, then we are going to give you a most beautiful wedding.
SUPMALE:Well, thanks, Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:I just want a small wedding.
LEADMALE:You know, just family.
SUPFEMALE:Mm-hm.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, you're gonna stay around while I break the news to Dad, aren't you? No.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't need me.
LEADFEMALE:Your father is a kind, loving, compassionate man.
SUPMALE:And, uh, he'll understand.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that helps.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, I don't wanna be here when he freaks.
LEADFEMALE:I feel like a hamster without a wheel.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I feel like a scuff mark on the loafer of life.
LEADMALE:Would you mind if I broke every dish? No! Don't break my dishes.
SUPFEMALE:- What about this tacky lamp then? - Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- What happened to nonviolence? - Mind, wake up.
LEADMALE:The '60s are over.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, why are you carrying on like this? It's really no big deal, except Orson forbids us to get married.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, he does, does he? Since when can Orson tell us whether we can get married or not? Since 2 million years ago when they outlawed marriage on Ork.
SUPMALE:Well, I hope you told him it's legal here on Earth.
LEADFEMALE:You bet.
SUPMALE:- Then what happened? - He lit me up like Times Square.
LEADMALE:Aah! Oh, baby, what's happening? You know, things like that, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you just can't accept his decision.
LEADFEMALE:That really makes me mad.
OTHERMALE:We're getting married.
LEADFEMALE:We don't have to get anyone's permission.
SUPMALE:- Hi, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:- Permission for what? Oh, uh, to tear the tags off the pillows.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:Why don't you sit down? And I'll fix you a nice breakfast.
LEADFEMALE:- Eggs, Danish - Son-in-law.
LEADFEMALE:I'll have a Danish.
OTHERMALE:A son-in-law? Yeah.
LEADMALE:It's not exactly the way I had planned to break it to you.
SUPFEMALE:But, uh, yeah, uh, Mork and I have decided to get married.
SUPFEMALE:Over my dead body.
LEADFEMALE:That'll trip us, Pop, but it won't stop us.
LEADMALE:Fred, that's terrible.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so happy for you and Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You know what? I wanna throw you a shower.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:No happy and no shower.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, I can't believe after our discussion that you would turn around and do anything this Stupid? - Thank you, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- You got it.
SUPFEMALE:Now, get out of her life.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, this isn't your orchestra.
LEADFEMALE:You just can't wave your baton and tell us what to do.
SUPFEMALE:Fred, pumpkin, why are you so against their getting married? It's obvious they're in love.
SUPMALE:Cathy, sweet potato, I know what I'm doing.
LEADMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:Fred, poodle, that's what you said just before you put the garage door on backwards.
OTHERMALE:Look, Cathy, angel face, trust me.
LEADMALE:They can't get married because Mork is from Uh He Uh, they're from two different worlds.
SUPMALE:Fred, there's no reason for us to get upset.
OTHERFEMALE:I understand this is a talk between you and your daughter.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll go run some errands.
LEADMALE:You two discuss it calmly, and I'll abide by your decision.
LEADMALE:Mindy, the shower is Saturday.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, idiot moi.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, obviously you and your dad, like, need some space here, okay? And, uh, who am I to intrude upon your privacy? That's what makes me different from Allen Funt.
LEADMALE:I'll just be up here knitting a Volkswagen.
LEADMALE:Upstairs.
LEADMALE:Remember Broadway? Have great rhythm Now, look, Mindy, let's just get one thing straight here.
LEADMALE:Yes, Dad, lets.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, I love you very much and we sure would like to have your blessing.
LEADMALE:But we don't need anyone's permission to get married.
LEADFEMALE:You know something, Mindy? You were a stubborn little girl and you've grown into a stubborn woman.
LEADMALE:But I'll tell you something.
LEADFEMALE:You've got a lot of You got a lot of moxie.
SUPFEMALE:As a matter of fact, I'd really be proud of you if you weren't making such a tragic mistake.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry you feel that way.
LEADMALE:This is gonna hurt me more than anything I've had to do before, but if I have to, I'll walk down that aisle alone.
LEADFEMALE:You will over my dead body.
LEADMALE:You have my blessing.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, soft touch.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! Oh, mon cher Papa! Oh, I love tweed.
SUPMALE:I love I'm gonna be your son-in-law, and you can just call me Meathead.
LEADMALE:You can count on it.
OTHERFEMALE:I better get back and turn that garage door around or Cathy will never forgive me.
SUPMALE:What have I done? Well, Mork, I've taken care of my half of the galaxy.
LEADFEMALE:The rest is up to you.
SUPMALE:You've gotta talk to Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-mm.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:No way I'm gonna go one on one with the big O.
LEADFEMALE:If you deal with Orson the way I just dealt with my father, you can get him to change his mind.
SUPMALE:Mind, I'd rather join the Libyan Air Force.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Mork, come on.
SUPFEMALE:You just gotta confront Orson.
LEADFEMALE:- And you've gotta do it right away.
SUPMALE:- Mind.
SUPMALE:Look, Mork, our future is in your hands.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:You're right, Mind.
OTHERMALE:We have an industrial-strength love.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna stand up to him! Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, your Winnebagoship.
SUPFEMALE:Be nice.
SUPMALE:Come on, Mind.
LEADMALE:Ors and I go back a long way.
LEADFEMALE:He was my Little League coach and the team bus.
OTHERMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Come on out.
LEADMALE:Show your face.
LEADMALE:No one here? Well, it's always cheaper to call after 11 anyway.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want, Mork? I'm in a hurry.
SUPFEMALE:I was just on my way to the Intergalactic Wine and Cheese Festival.
LEADFEMALE:Well, sir, this will only take a second.
LEADMALE:Remember what you said when I asked if I could marry the marvelous, mercurial Midwestern Mindy? Yes.
LEADMALE:I said no Orkan shall enter into marriage, especially to a lower life-form, one that still chews their food.
LEADMALE:I was hoping you'd forgotten, sir, but I never really wanted to challenge your authority, and I hate to pooh-pooh your will, but there is nothing that you can do to stop me from marrying Mindy.
LEADMALE:In that case, I'm going to miss our little chats.
SUPFEMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:Oh, just kidding, sir.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I don't know what gets into my head sometimes.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I don't really need to marry Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, her cooking tastes like insulation.
LEADMALE:I'm glad to hear you say that, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:But just remember, if you defy me, a hideous fate will befall you.
LEADFEMALE:For example? I will alter your molecular structure into a life-form that will be more obedient.
LEADMALE:Oh, ho.
LEADFEMALE:You want obedience? Obedience are us.
SUPMALE:You say jump, I say how high? You say run, I say how fast? You say "Camptown," I say "doo-dah.
LEADMALE:" I've heard enough, Mork.
SUPMALE:Hold your tongue.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, sir.
LEADMALE:You've got it.
LEADFEMALE:Did I startle you? Not as much as if you'd been Ethel Merman, but What happened? You told Orson, right? You confronted him and told him that we were gonna be married? Well He backed down, right? Because you're strong and brave with the courage of your convictions.
SUPMALE:Well And no force exists that can prevent us from being married, right, Mork? Well, those were my words exactly, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Um, you know, I told him I I really let him have it.
SUPFEMALE:I leveled him.
LEADFEMALE:- You did? - I made him feel lower than the price of pork in Tel Aviv.
SUPFEMALE:Let's just break out the champagne right now.
LEADFEMALE:Let's celebrate.
LEADFEMALE:Let's pop our corks.
LEADMALE:The shampoo is champagne! You're kidding, Mork? We're really getting married? - Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:- Aah! I can't believe it! I'm so proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:Mork has committed a flagrant violation of Orkan law.
LEADFEMALE:He will be severely punished.
OTHERFEMALE:- This is the big day.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
SUPMALE:You want me to help you with that? No, I can get it.
LEADMALE:I'm not one of those nervous brides-to-be.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Honey.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, take it easy.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, come on, sweetie.
LEADMALE:Come on, sit down, sit down, sit down.
OTHERMALE:All right, now just take it easy, honey, and relax.
LEADMALE:Here, I have something for you.
OTHERFEMALE:I gave this to your mother on our wedding day, and I know she'd want you to have it.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dad, her gold four-leaf clover.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I hope Mork doesn't replant it.
LEADFEMALE:It always brought us a lot of luck.
OTHERFEMALE:Look who we got as a daughter.
SUPMALE:Aw, Dad, it's beautiful.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:And thanks for always being there when I needed you.
OTHERFEMALE:And I always will be.
LEADMALE:- Just like that.
LEADMALE:- Just like that.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I guess I'd better get to the chapel.
LEADFEMALE:Just think, in a little while you'll be Mrs.
SUPMALE:Mindy Mork doesn't have a last name.
SUPMALE:Uh, what are you gonna call yourselves? Well, we've been talking about last names.
LEADFEMALE:He's torn between Travolta and Pittsburgh.
LEADMALE:But I think I can talk him into McConnell or Phoenix.
OTHERFEMALE:Work on Phoenix.
LEADMALE:I'll see you there.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, we'd better get going.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing in there? Oh, I'm just trying to work on my hair to achieve that John Davidson look.
LEADMALE:You can do that at the church.
LEADMALE:We really should have been there five minutes ago.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:We don't wanna be late, do we? There'd be 100 rabid bingo fans out there eating our smorgasbord.
LEADFEMALE:Can you give me a hand with the, uh Ah! Oh, yeah, you're probably gonna need some help with that, won't you? What is that? What? Oh, this.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's my morning coat.
SUPMALE:Remember the guy with the accent and the pins in his mouth.
SUPMALE:- No! I'm talking about the hair! - Mind, I told you I was working on it.
OTHERFEMALE:Not just the hair, the ears and the nose.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that.
OTHERMALE:Well, Orson's just turning me into a dog.
LEADMALE:Come on, let's go.
OTHERFEMALE:Orson's turning you into a dog? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You'll have to drive, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna stick my head out the window.
SUPMALE:Orson's turning you into a dog? Um, yup.
SUPFEMALE:Level time, isn't it? Well, Mind, um, I lied to you.
LEADFEMALE:He really didn't give his permission for me to marry you.
LEADMALE:I made my bed, now I have to lie in it, if I'm still allowed on the furniture.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, we are getting married in one hour.
LEADMALE:This is no time for jokes.
OTHERMALE:Ow! Ow! Ow! LBJ! LBJ! - They're real! - Of course, Mind.
LEADMALE:You don't get this kind of quality from a novelty shop.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:This is happening.
SUPFEMALE:This is really happening! Mork, we gotta do something.
LEADFEMALE:What can we do? Well, I'm doing it right now, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I'm using all my will to reverse the process.
SUPFEMALE:It's simply a case of mind over matter.
OTHERMALE:Listen, we're gonna have the wedding just as planned.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, he can't turn me into a dog.
LEADFEMALE:Telegram for Mindy McConnell.
SUPMALE:Stop it.
LEADFEMALE:Sit! Sit! Leave them in the hall.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, it's getting worse.
SUPFEMALE:Your hair's getting longer and you were barking.
OTHERFEMALE:I was? Oh, Mork, I think you're losing control of this.
SUPMALE:I think you're losing the battle.
OTHERMALE:Look at it this way, Mind.
SUPMALE:It might be just a bad cough.
LEADFEMALE:Could be worse.
OTHERFEMALE:He might have turned me into a blowfish or a Stridex pad or a lounge singer.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, come on, you've gotta fight.
OTHERMALE:Try and stand up like a human.
LEADMALE:I can't, Mind, but I can do this.
LEADMALE:How could Orson do this to us? Quick, Mork, we've gotta call him.
LEADMALE:Plug me into your mind with you and I'll talk him into changing you back.
LEADMALE:Off! What you have to do is stick your finger in my ear and with your other hand scratch my head.
LEADFEMALE:- I didn't have to do that the last time.
SUPMALE:- But it sure will make me happy.
LEADFEMALE:Just call him.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in.
SUPFEMALE:Where is Orson? How can he keep us on hold like this? Call him again, Mork.
SUPMALE:I guess I'm in this by myself.
LEADMALE:Mindy calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Where are you? This is an emergency! I'm here, Earthling.
LEADMALE:What's the problem? Don't they allow pets in your building? Down, boy.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, sit! Out! Out! Ah, you've kept his name.
LEADFEMALE:I thought Scruffy would be more appropriate.
SUPMALE:How can you be so cruel? You've stripped him of his dignity! You just can't go around turning people into Mork, I'm trying to make a point.
LEADMALE:Fetch, Mork! I called the house.
OTHERMALE:They don't answer.
LEADFEMALE:I called the police, the hospitals.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:They were behind me when I left them.
LEADMALE:I don't know what happened.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, dear, I'm getting worried.
LEADFEMALE:That's gotta be Mork.
LEADMALE:Nobody knocks on a church door.
SUPFEMALE:It's about time you answered.
LEADFEMALE:I was getting a headache.
LEADFEMALE:- Was he invited? - Unfortunately he's the best man.
OTHERFEMALE:I would have been here sooner, but it's a little tough hitchhiking in this outfit.
LEADMALE:Interesting jacket.
LEADFEMALE:It's a suit.
LEADMALE:I lost the pants crawling over the wall.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, did you see Mork and Mindy when you came in? Not unless they're wearing little red jackets and parking cars.
LEADMALE:You mean they're not here yet? Well, lucky for you I'm an emcee.
OTHERMALE:You were about to lose your crowd.
OTHERMALE:Dear friends we are gathered here in this house of worship, just two blocks south of the House of Pies.
LEADFEMALE:And speaking of pies, would someone please explain to me what is meant by Black Forest cake? Where is the Black Forest? Do they have cakes hanging from trees in the Black Forest? But most important, Padre, whatever happened to Forrest Tucker? Orson, I'm pleading with you.
LEADFEMALE:How can you do this? If you give Mork back to me, he'll show you the values of being human.
LEADMALE:If I had emotions, I'd probably be very touched right now.
SUPMALE:Then you're not gonna change him back? He broke the law.
LEADFEMALE:Orson, we came here Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Mork? Here boy! All right, Orson.
LEADMALE:I just want you to know one thing.
LEADMALE:You may have changed Mork physically, but underneath all this fur, he's still Mork.
LEADMALE:He risked everything for me so we could be married, and your little punishment isn't gonna change my plans.
LEADMALE:I still love him and I'm going through with this ceremony.
SUPFEMALE:You're going to marry a dog? No, I'm marrying Mork.
OTHERMALE:We'll see, but she sure is a spunky little alien.
LEADMALE:If you're not busy after the reception, would you like to catch a white sale? - I don't think so.
LEADMALE:- I see.
LEADFEMALE:How about washing my hair? Where's the groom? Who invited a dog? Phillipe, you're not supposed to be here.
SUPFEMALE:You're supposed to be home taping the Ram game.
LEADMALE:Oh, forget it.
LEADMALE:Sit in the pew.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Uncle Ernie, you're out on parole, good to see you.
OTHERMALE:Aunt Tilly, bleached your mustache.
LEADFEMALE:Wonderful.
SUPMALE:Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join this man and this woman in the holy bond of matrimony.
LEADMALE:Be there anyone here who opposes this union, let them speak now or forever remain silent.
LEADMALE:Phew.
LEADMALE:The rings, please.
LEADMALE:Psst.
LEADFEMALE:The rings.
OTHERFEMALE:Talk to one another.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be right with you.
LEADFEMALE:I hope your next wedding's casual.
LEADMALE:And now, instead of reciting the traditional vows, Mork and Mindy have a few words to say to one another.
SUPMALE:Mindy.
OTHERMALE:Mork, when you entered my life, you brought me happiness, joy and laughter.
OTHERMALE:My love for you transcends time and space.
OTHERMALE:Grow with me, the best is yet to be.
SUPMALE:Mind, you're my friend, my love, you're my life.
LEADFEMALE:Supposed to be more but the lady in the card shop said, "Buy or get out.
LEADFEMALE:" I don't know the right words.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, I don't think there are enough to describe how I really feel about you.
SUPMALE:"Love" is a small word but I think it covers so much.
OTHERMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:By the power vested in me, by the state of Colorado, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
LEADMALE:You may kiss the bride.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome to my world, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Pittsburgh.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:We really got married.
SUPFEMALE:Just think, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:In 24 hours, we'll be on a plane to Acapulco.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Acapulco is tres passé, Mind, that's for bottled water salesmen.
SUPMALE:We're gonna spend 25 days and one beautiful night on Ork.
LEADMALE:Ork? Mind, Mind, Mind I've never been in outer space before.
LEADMALE:Will I even be able to breathe on Ork? Beats me, Mind, but we'll find out.
OTHERMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Na-no, na-no.
LEADFEMALE:This has been a day to remember.
LEADMALE:Mindy was such a beautiful bride.
SUPFEMALE:But, Cora, they're honeymooning on Ork.
OTHERMALE:Why can't they go to the Poconos? Well, I think it's exciting to go to another planet.
LEADMALE:And I'd rather have a frontal lobotomy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, go for it.
LEADFEMALE:- Hello.
LEADFEMALE:- Hey.
SUPMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:It's almost time to blast off.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy, honey, won't you reconsider? I mean, we're talking about space travel here.
LEADMALE:Going off to some strange planet.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Dad, it's where Mork grew up.
LEADFEMALE:He just wants to share it with me.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, well, couldn't you just thumb through his yearbook? Dad, I'm a journalist.
LEADFEMALE:This is the opportunity of a lifetime.
LEADFEMALE:To boldly go where no man has gone.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, I'm thrilled.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I'm exhilarated.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm scared to death.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, that's a catchy tune.
SUPMALE:I just wish I could remember the words.
LEADMALE:Are those special glasses to shield our eyes from the ultraviolet rays? No, no, Mind.
LEADMALE:I just bought them because they're gnarly.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that's great, Mork.
SUPMALE:Are you crazy? You can't let this man pilot you millions of miles through space.
SUPFEMALE:He doesn't even have a driver's license.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on now, Pops, come on now.
SUPMALE:I've been to the four corners of the universe, I've charted 16 solar systems, and I can refold a road map correctly.
LEADMALE:Well, there's another thing, Mork.
LEADMALE:Mindy doesn't travel all that well.
LEADMALE:- She got sick in her baby carriage.
LEADMALE:- Aw.
LEADMALE:Oh, that little "neener pooter.
SUPMALE:" Don't worry about her.
LEADMALE:We're gonna be traveling first class.
SUPMALE:It's here, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy.
LEADMALE:Boy, we're gonna go in style! We're gonna go Oh, shazbot.
LEADFEMALE:They sent the compact model.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, we'll just have to make do.
LEADFEMALE:Now, now, now, just a minute, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:The words "deep space" and "make do" don't go together.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, mon papa, ma familia, don't you worry about a thing.
LEADMALE:I have prepared for everything that can be planned.
LEADFEMALE:I've packed plenty of Dramamine and Tang.
LEADFEMALE:Has anyone seen my Dramamine and Tang? Uh, I packed it.
OTHERMALE:My wife.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'll keep her.
SUPMALE:I packed a lunch for you.
LEADMALE:And there's a piece of your wedding cake in there too.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, Grandma.
SUPMALE:And we'll both bring you back something from Ork.
SUPFEMALE:Where are you going to stay up there? We're going first class.
SUPMALE:We're staying at the Hotel And Spa.
LEADFEMALE:- You have reservations? - No, it seems like a nice place.
LEADFEMALE:Well, just remember, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:That's pretty valuable cargo there.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you're right.
OTHERFEMALE:I really am proud of this suitcase.
OTHERMALE:He meant me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Don't you worry.
LEADFEMALE:Your little girl is in very good hands.
SUPMALE:Don't touch that! You'll kill us all! Good evening and welcome to Air Ork's intergalactic traveler, the Huevos Grande.
LEADMALE:Now that we're in flight, be aware of the total lack of safety measures.
SUPMALE:First of all, we have no exits, either front, back or side.
LEADFEMALE:In case of emergency, a brown paper bag will fall from the ceiling, - which means absolutely nothing.
LEADFEMALE:- Heh.
LEADFEMALE:On this flight, our in-flight movie will be The High and the Mighty and Fate is a Lonely Hunter.
OTHERFEMALE:Airport '7ç.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:My turn.
LEADFEMALE:I spy with my little eye something starting with the letter J.
OTHERMALE:I spy the planet Jupiter.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADMALE:- Very good.
LEADMALE:- That's hard to miss.
LEADFEMALE:It's so huge.
LEADMALE:Okay, I spy with my little eye something beginning with the letter K.
LEADFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:I see a meteor coming right at us.
LEADFEMALE:- You're supposed to say, "I spy," not - No! Besides, meteor begins with M Yeah, it's a Meteor! Mind, Mind, wake up.
LEADMALE:Look on the scanner.
SUPMALE:We're here.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:Ork is beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, yeah.
SUPMALE:Just think, me, Mindy McConnell, the first woman in space.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're not the first one.
LEADFEMALE:There was a Russian lady, but you're the first one that shaves her legs.
SUPMALE:Aren't we going awfully fast? Yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, Mind, isn't it a kick? Oh, there's the city now.
LEADMALE:I better slow down.
OTHERFEMALE:Pity.
LEADFEMALE:Welcoming you to Squelm in the Elm Memorial Airport.
LEADFEMALE:There will be a brief delay due to the controllers' strike.
LEADFEMALE:Don't stand up until we're completely docked at the gate.
LEADMALE:And observe the "No Screaming" signs.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Mork, Ork is just amazing.
SUPMALE:- I know, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Look at this hotel.
SUPMALE:Everything is just so futuristic.
SUPFEMALE:This is one of the old downtown hotels, Mind.
LEADMALE:You should see the ones on the Strip.
LEADMALE:Boy, Kenahara.
LEADMALE:What are we gonna do first? I just wanna do everything.
OTHERMALE:We'll go see my old neighborhood, if you don't mind digging with your hands.
LEADFEMALE:What? Ha, ha.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Na-no.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Na-no.
LEADMALE:What's? What's that all about? Oh, that's our version of the National Enquirer, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Here you'll be a celebrity, because they've never seen an Earthling before.
OTHERMALE:There's gonna be a little giggling and gawking.
LEADFEMALE:Like an Alexander Haig press conference.
LEADFEMALE:Na-no.
LEADFEMALE:I suddenly feel very tired and very out of place.
SUPMALE:- Let's go to our room.
SUPFEMALE:- All right.
LEADFEMALE:- What did you say? - I said you weren't that contagious.
LEADMALE:And also I said you were housebroken too.
LEADMALE:May I help you? Uh, yes.
SUPFEMALE:We have reservations under the name of Mork.
OTHERMALE:Mind, why are you talking to him? He asked about our reservations.
LEADMALE:Mind, that's a penguin.
LEADMALE:They don't talk.
LEADFEMALE:They hardly ever take reservations.
SUPMALE:Yes, Mork.
OTHERMALE:And this must be your wife, the Earthling.
LEADMALE:Well, it takes all kinds.
LEADMALE:Orlando, this is taken care of through, uh, Orson's office.
OTHERMALE:We'd like the special room overlooking the ice machine.
LEADFEMALE:The room won't be ready for 30 micro-bleems.
LEADFEMALE:Na-no, na-no.
LEADMALE:Doesn't he look amazingly like Elton John, Mind? Mork, Orson carries a lot of weight around here.
LEADMALE:Couldn't we get him to lean on the snippy little guy? Listen, I'm your husband.
SUPMALE:I don't need Orson's weight.
OTHERMALE:I have a lot of clout around here.
LEADMALE:I used to be the dinner diver in the lobster tank.
OTHERFEMALE:If that penguin gives you any trouble, wait right here.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, I'll just browse.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Why do I feel like the Elephant Man? Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:On Earth we don't poke people we don't date.
LEADMALE:Okay, that's enough.
LEADFEMALE:No more poking.
OTHERMALE:Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, officers, they didn't mean any harm.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure they've just never Wait a minute! Mork! Wait.
SUPFEMALE:I'm an American.
SUPMALE:Help! Mork! Help! Mind? Mind, I've arranged for the room, hon.
LEADFEMALE:Peekaboo.
SUPMALE:Hope she didn't go in the pool.
LEADMALE:It hasn't eaten yet today.
LEADMALE:Hello, police? My wife is missing.
LEADFEMALE:She's an Earthling.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, she'll be the only one who knows who Claude Akins is.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, never mind.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Mind.
LEADMALE:Mind.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Mind.
LEADMALE:Hope you're all right.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, I was dragged out of here by the space cadets.
LEADFEMALE:And taken someplace for this physical examination.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, they paraded me around and asked me questions I didn't understand and gave me this.
SUPFEMALE:I guess it's some sort of a visa or something.
SUPMALE:That wasn't a customs office.
SUPFEMALE:That was a pet show.
LEADFEMALE:What? You didn't do too badly.
LEADFEMALE:You took fourth place.
LEADFEMALE:A pet show? Oh, I'm so humiliated.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, I know.
LEADFEMALE:You should have at least won in the obedience class.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, I don't know what to Thank you.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, I'm really sorry about that.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I wanted to make the honeymoon very, very special.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, no, it's not your fault.
LEADMALE:It's just been such a long trip.
SUPMALE:And And our rooms weren't ready.
LEADFEMALE:In fourth place.
LEADMALE:Mind! Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I went to school with his father.
OTHERFEMALE:I just need some rest.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go to our room.
SUPMALE:I admit I love your attitude.
LEADMALE:You're hanging in there with me.
LEADMALE:No wonder they call you the better half.
SUPMALE:Now the room's all set to go and let's go upstairs and we'll play newlyweds, you know, count our savings bonds.
LEADMALE:This is an intergalactic class hotel.
LEADMALE:They modify each room to satisfy the needs of the specific alien.
LEADMALE:It's gonna be like any Ramada Inn on Earth, right down to the little paper sash on the commode.
LEADMALE:Mork, it's customary to be carried over the threshold.
LEADMALE:Oh, all right, Mind, but I'm a little heavy.
LEADMALE:Me, not you.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, Mork, that was real romantic.
SUPMALE:Well, Mind, this is just like any room on Earth.
LEADMALE:I mean, lots of rooms I've seen on Earth with floor paper and wall rugs.
SUPMALE:- Ceiling chairs.
SUPMALE:- Mork.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Mind, they screwed it up! I'm sorry! It looks like it was decorated by Fools-R-Us.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, how could they do this to me? Oh! Too much coffee, Tom? - Mork, it's all right.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, it is? No, but you're distraught.
SUPMALE:We'll talk about it later.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, Mind.
OTHERMALE:I just wanted our honeymoon to be very, very special.
LEADMALE:Oh, I know.
LEADMALE:Look, the important thing is that we're together, and it is our honeymoon.
LEADFEMALE:Aw.
LEADFEMALE:In the dictionary it says, "Compassionate, see you.
SUPMALE:" - I love you, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- I love you, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:- Dong-ding? - Dong-ding? They can even screw up a doorbell.
SUPMALE:Oh, maybe it's the bellhops with our luggage.
LEADMALE:- Do you tip bellhops here on Ork? - No.
LEADMALE:They're robots.
LEADFEMALE:If you tip them, they can't get back on their feet.
LEADMALE:- Surprise! - Surprise! Oh, gosh, Mind! It's the Peevee clones, Six and Seven.
SUPFEMALE:- It's nice to meet you.
SUPMALE:- You must be Mindy, his wife.
LEADMALE:Whatever that is.
LEADFEMALE:We heard you were back.
OTHERFEMALE:We could hardly wait to get up here.
LEADFEMALE:Six thought it'd be funny if we brought in your luggage.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we had to tip the robot.
LEADFEMALE:He's still out there.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, he's out there.
OTHERFEMALE:His little feet just flailing away.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, the clones and I, we go way back.
LEADFEMALE:Remember? Rick 'em, rack 'em, ruck 'em, ruck 'em, get that ball and really fight! We used to sneak into the school bathroom and tell, like, jokes, and l Well, you know, I got caught for being funny, and that's why I was sent to Earth.
LEADFEMALE:Wait till you hear our latest Orson joke.
OTHERMALE:This is really gonna shorten your circuits.
LEADMALE:Okay, now, watch those sides.
SUPMALE:Here goes.
SUPFEMALE:Orson is a big - Fatso! - Fatso! I can see why you were the only one caught.
SUPFEMALE:We might as well make ourselves at home.
SUPMALE:Might as well.
SUPFEMALE:We've got a lot of catching up for Mork to do.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Mork, your human friend is really going to appreciate this one.
SUPFEMALE:How many Earthlings does it take to screw in a light bulb? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:How many Earthlings does it take to screw in a light bulb? - One.
LEADMALE:- One.
LEADFEMALE:They're gone, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Mork, I've had colds that didn't hang on as long as the Peevee clones.
OTHERMALE:I thought they'd take the hint when we put on our nightgowns.
SUPFEMALE:I thought they'd take the hint when we told them to get out.
OTHERFEMALE:Especially after they referred to me as "your creature.
OTHERFEMALE:" Well I guess we're alone now.
OTHERMALE:I guess so.
LEADMALE:Just the two of us, huh? Yep.
SUPFEMALE:Looks that way.
SUPMALE:- On our honeymoon night.
LEADMALE:- Yep.
SUPFEMALE:Sure is dark.
LEADMALE:Sure is.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's our wedding night.
SUPMALE:I'd better not put this off any longer, huh? Guess not.
LEADMALE:Bette Davis eyes Night, Mind.
LEADMALE:What was that? That's the ancient Orkan honeymoon ritual.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:The honeymoon ritual is a little different on Earth.
LEADFEMALE:What's different, Mind? No mask? Hardly.
LEADMALE:My father gave me this marriage manual to give to you.
OTHERFEMALE:I told him he was crazy.
SUPFEMALE:That's one for Dad.
LEADFEMALE:- Read this.
LEADFEMALE:- Now? Please.
LEADFEMALE:Cute pictures.
SUPMALE:Just read, Mork.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:Mm-hm.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, all done.
OTHERMALE:Is there anything you don't understand? No, clear as a bell, Mind.
SUPMALE:L I'm just gonna step in the bathroom for just a minute.
LEADMALE:Mork.
SUPMALE:Mork, are you all right? - Did that book upset you? - No! Not at all.
LEADFEMALE:Really, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just gonna sleep on the bathroom floor tonight and maybe forever.
LEADFEMALE:That's ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:You're not gonna sleep in the bathroom.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, come out here.
SUPMALE:I wanna talk to you.
LEADMALE:No way, Jose.
SUPMALE:No chance, Lance.
LEADMALE:Not tonight, Irving, I have a headache! Mork, you're my husband.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna let you sleep in the bathroom.
LEADMALE:If you don't come out, I'll come in there and get you.
LEADFEMALE:Aha! I'll lock the door.
LEADMALE:Stupid Orkans forgot to put a lock on the door! They probably didn't think we'd need one.
LEADFEMALE:Now, come on, Mork, come out of there.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:Mork? All right, I'm coming in there.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork! Mork, come back.
SUPMALE:Don't run away.
LEADFEMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:We should have gone to Niagara Falls.
OTHERMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:Mork, where are you? I know you're here someplace.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, this is our honeymoon.
LEADMALE:Is this really the way you wanna start out our marriage? Mork not here right now! Mork, will you come out here, please? I need to talk to you.
SUPMALE:I can't, Mind Oh, he can't! Mork.
LEADMALE:Mind.
LEADFEMALE:You knew it was me all along, didn't you? Psychic.
SUPMALE:Well, I wasn't really running away.
LEADFEMALE:I just like to hyperventilate alone.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Mork, I think I realize for the first time how you must feel on Earth.
LEADFEMALE:- I don't know how you cope.
LEADFEMALE:- I've got you to take care of me.
OTHERFEMALE:Aw.
LEADMALE:I haven't told you this, but, you know, I think Ork is really a lovely planet.
SUPMALE:I mean, the three moons are very romantic.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hm.
LEADMALE:And this garden, it's It's beautiful.
SUPMALE:Look, these flowers look almost exactly like Earth roses.
LEADFEMALE:They should look exactly like Earth roses.
LEADMALE:I've been sending them here for three years now.
LEADFEMALE:You see, I wanted to share a little bit of Earth's beauty with Ork.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, you never told me that.
LEADFEMALE:That's so nice.
LEADFEMALE:They're not as beautiful as you are, though.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you wanna tell me what's bothering you? I'm scared.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:Come over here.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, everyone's scared of getting married.
LEADFEMALE:It's a new experience.
SUPMALE:It's a normal emotion.
LEADFEMALE:- It is? - Sure.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, just think, someday we might have children and I'm scared to death of that.
LEADMALE:But I know that you'll be there to help me get through it.
SUPMALE:See, that's the really wonderful thing about marriage, is you have a friend who loves you and a partner who helps you through the rough times.
LEADMALE:This friend and partner isn't ashamed of the other friend and partner? No, not if they love each other.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, trouble, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:- For picking a rose? Yeah, we better walk fast.
LEADMALE:This is a national monument, Mind.
LEADMALE:Picking that rose would be the same on Earth as if you plucked one of Brooke Shields' eyebrows.
LEADMALE:Back in the room again, huh? - Looks that way.
LEADMALE:- Yeah, looks that way.
LEADFEMALE:Well, back in the room again.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:Sounds like a Willie Nelson song.
LEADFEMALE:Well, um, wanna watch a little TV, Mind? Orson Knows Best is on.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mork, I'd rather talk.
SUPMALE:You know, Mork, until today, I never really realized what it's like to be a stranger on a strange planet.
OTHERFEMALE:But as bizarre and as scary as Ork has been to me, at least I've been here with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, you got it there, kid.
OTHERMALE:It's just you and me, sweetheart.
OTHERFEMALE:Guess again.
LEADMALE:- They're back.
LEADFEMALE:- No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind.
SUPMALE:That was Peevee clones Six and Seven.
LEADMALE:These are One and Two, the originals.
LEADFEMALE:Do you wanna hear our latest Orson joke? Mind, you think Six and Seven are funny, these clones wrote the book.
SUPMALE:Okay, now, hold onto those sides.
LEADMALE:Here goes.
LEADMALE:Orson is a big Fatso.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Fatso! - You didn't laugh the first time.
LEADFEMALE:- I know, Mind, but I just got it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, your delivery's incredible.
LEADFEMALE:"Fatso.
LEADFEMALE:" Just the way you said "fatso.
LEADFEMALE:" - She's funny.
LEADMALE:- She's funny.
LEADFEMALE:You think she's funny, wait till you read this.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPFEMALE:Check that one out for a week, and let me know when you figure it out.
LEADMALE:Check that one out.
SUPFEMALE:Rick 'em, rack 'em, ruck 'em, ruck 'em, get that ball and really fight! - They're gone.
LEADMALE:- They're gone.
LEADMALE:- Here we are in the room again.
SUPFEMALE:- Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:- Just the two of us.
SUPMALE:- Looks that way.
LEADMALE:I just want you to know I think I understand your Earth customs.
LEADFEMALE:- You do? - Yeah, and I really do care.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:Just one thing.
SUPFEMALE:Would you wear the chicken head tonight? - You're doing great, Mind.
LEADMALE:- Thanks.
LEADMALE:- Just stay in your lane.
LEADMALE:- Okay.
SUPFEMALE:We should really send Orson a nice thank you note.
SUPMALE:- Yeah.
SUPMALE:- Because I had a great time.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, me too.
SUPFEMALE:Mork! You know what my favorite part was? - What? - Guess.
LEADFEMALE:- The pillow fight? - No.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, well No, my favorite part was My favorite part was waking up in the morning and seeing you laying there next to me and knowing for the rest of my life your face will be the first one I wake up to every morning.
LEADMALE:Oh, ditto, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- And I've got one thing to say to you.
OTHERMALE:- What? Meteor!
OTHERFEMALE:Na-no, na-no.
LEADFEMALE:I feel so nauseous.
SUPMALE:Oh, my stomach feels like cat drool on a dog lip.
LEADMALE:Yes, this seltzer shall be the eraser on the blackboard of life.
LEADFEMALE:It shall help.
LEADFEMALE:Why am I talking like a character in a Tennessee Williams' play? I don't know.
LEADMALE:It doesn't matter.
LEADMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:Here I go.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, what a head rush! For sure.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, more tiny bubbles than a Don Ho medley.
SUPFEMALE:Morning.
LEADMALE:Little hugger squash.
OTHERMALE:- Happy one-month anniversary to you.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh.
SUPFEMALE:What do you give someone for their one-month anniversary? Styrofoam.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I bought you a boogie board.
LEADFEMALE:That's romantic.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I have a little surprise for you.
OTHERFEMALE:The Hammond family is doing a TV special in Boulder, and I'll cover the dress rehearsal.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you might wanna come with me.
LEADFEMALE:The Hammond family? Oh, Mind, the All-American Hammonds? Oh, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I especially love Donna and Mario.
SUPMALE:They're my favorite.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, that's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:That Pass.
OTHERMALE:Pass? But, Mork, it's our anniversary.
LEADMALE:I mean, I know, but I've got millions of things to do, and I have to send a condolence card to Morris, the cat's mother.
LEADMALE:At least come down and have lunch with me.
SUPMALE:I said I was busy! - Whoa.
LEADMALE:Aren't we snippy today.
LEADFEMALE:- Mind, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:You know how I get before the opening of trout season.
OTHERMALE:We'll have a lovely dinner tonight, won't we, hon? Maybe? - Okay, I accept your apology.
SUPMALE:- Aw.
LEADMALE:I gotta run.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll see you after work.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:- Big kiss.
SUPMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:- Bye, little "pooter.
SUPFEMALE:" Oh, what a performance.
SUPFEMALE:My stomach feels like it has a Greek Orthodox wedding going on in it.
LEADFEMALE:Doctor, is that you? Patient! Is that you? Mork, I'm glad you called.
SUPMALE:I don't ordinarily make house calls.
LEADMALE:I had to make an exception in this case.
SUPMALE:I don't have an office.
LEADFEMALE:Exidor, I don't feel very well.
LEADMALE:I'm Go no further.
LEADMALE:First I need you to sign this waiver.
OTHERMALE:It clears me of any wrongdoing in the event of death or permanent disability resulting from my total ignorance of the medical profession.
OTHERFEMALE:But you're a doctor.
LEADMALE:The only reason I became a doctor was to get MD plates, so I could park in front of Bloomingdale's.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, moment, open your mouth wide.
OTHERFEMALE:Nurse Ryan, will you come in, please? What are you gawking at? Haven't you ever seen a naked man before? Hmm.
LEADMALE:Three fifteen, that's a tad high, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:It'd be perfect if I were a rump roast.
LEADFEMALE:Exidor, do something just as long as I don't have to have anything shaved.
LEADMALE:Relax.
OTHERMALE:You better turn your head.
LEADMALE:This might hurt a little.
LEADFEMALE:Damn, I'm good! Exidor, I feel strange and wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:I feel kind of achy and I mean I have cravings for, like, Teflon bananas.
LEADMALE:I feel kind of queasy and short-tempered! What is it? What is it? Well, either you're turning into Billy Martin, or you're pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:- That's - That's That's it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm preggers.
SUPFEMALE:I've got a bun in the oven.
LEADFEMALE:Nonsense! And that's me saying it.
SUPMALE:Wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no! You don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:You really don't understand.
LEADMALE:You see, I think I really am pregnant.
LEADMALE:I could be pregnant.
SUPMALE:You see, an Orkan and an Earthling have never mated before.
SUPMALE:It's possible.
SUPFEMALE:You know, if it is, it's a miracle.
LEADFEMALE:Every patient thinks that their case is special.
SUPMALE:All right, come into my consultation room.
LEADFEMALE:We'll talk it over.
SUPMALE:Just sit here.
LEADMALE:I feel so weak in the knees.
SUPMALE:Mork I'm pregnant, I'm really pregnant.
SUPMALE:Oh, I can't wait to tell Mindy and Omni magazine.
SUPMALE:Mork, as your personal physician and doubles partner, I suggest that you break it to your wife gently.
LEADMALE:And work on that serve.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I just felt a sharp pain, Exidor.
LEADFEMALE:Another one too.
LEADMALE:What does it mean? Well, it means you're in labor and I'm playing singles.
LEADFEMALE:My little bundle of joy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look.
LEADMALE:My little bundle's here.
LEADMALE:Oh, say hello to the world.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know if it's a boy or a girl.
SUPMALE:We won't know till it hatches.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:And look, I have a navel.
OTHERFEMALE:That's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:And no stretch marks either.
LEADMALE:Hello, little "nooter.
SUPMALE:" I'm a mother, and I'm gonna give you everything except an Oedipus complex.
LEADMALE:And I can read Harlequin books now, and stay up all night for no reason.
SUPMALE:Yay! Come on now.
LEADFEMALE:Smile.
SUPFEMALE:Say, "Cheez Whiz.
SUPFEMALE:" There you go.
LEADFEMALE:A picture of you and mom.
LEADMALE:Oh, boy, Mindy is really gonna love you.
LEADMALE:That is, if I get up the nerve to tell her that you were born.
OTHERMALE:- Hi, Mork, I'm home.
LEADFEMALE:- Nap time.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I've got this great idea.
SUPMALE:How to make our one-month anniversary even better than our three-week anniversary.
LEADFEMALE:Wanna hear it? You can't really top Andy Warhol's 3D Hamlet.
LEADMALE:"Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave am I.
SUPFEMALE:" Interesting.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we're gonna get all dressed up, and we're gonna go out and do something we've never done before.
LEADMALE:That's fine.
SUPMALE:Put on your prom dress and I'll put on my Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Peanut outfit.
SUPFEMALE:Then we can have a very candid, sober discussion about family.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mork, I wanna go out and do something romantic.
OTHERFEMALE:Like, I wanna go ride the carousel, or I know.
OTHERMALE:Let's put on warm clothes, go out and make angels in the snow like in Love Story.
LEADMALE:The sad thing about that movie was that she became an angel before she ever had a family.
LEADMALE:You know what's making a big romantic comeback? - The family unit.
LEADFEMALE:- Don't talk to me about family units.
LEADMALE:I just spent the whole day with the Hammond family, all nine of them.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mork, let's just go out, you and me.
LEADMALE:I mean, we're young, we're in love, we're newlyweds.
OTHERFEMALE:You're absolutely right, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe we should have a little tête-à-tête and then sit and talk.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with going out and having some good old-fashioned fun? We could talk in Latin if you want.
LEADMALE:Mork Mind, Mind.
SUPMALE:Mind, Mind, how can we lead such frivolous lives? I mean, when you consider what's going on in the world today.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, trouble in El Salvador, cruise missiles.
LEADMALE:I mean, bad line-calls against John McEnroe.
LEADMALE:And the family.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you keep bringing up family? I'd like to have one, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Right now.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna have a family someday just as badly as you do.
SUPFEMALE:But a family is something you plan for.
LEADFEMALE:We're just starting out.
LEADFEMALE:We're not really ready emotionally or financially.
SUPMALE:My gosh, my career's just getting off the ground, and yours Well, this is America.
SUPMALE:Mork, if we had a baby right now, it wouldn't be fair to the child in the long run.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe down the road a bit.
LEADMALE:Now, let's just go out, you and me, - for a good time.
SUPFEMALE:- You don't understand.
OTHERMALE:Time is of the essence.
SUPMALE:Pakistan has the bomb and all they have to do is roll it down the hill.
LEADMALE:Mork, we just got married.
LEADFEMALE:It's the time for the two of us, so let's work on that a while, all right? Now, I'm gonna go get changed, and we're gonna go have a nice candlelight dinner.
LEADMALE:And then maybe go for a sleigh ride.
OTHERMALE:Okay? And then maybe come home and thaw each other out.
LEADFEMALE:There's gotta be some way we can get you and Mindy together.
LEADMALE:Too bad it's not Easter, huh? - Do you know what time it is? - I swear I heard somebody.
LEADMALE:I didn't hear anything.
OTHERFEMALE:- There it is again.
LEADFEMALE:- Who could it be at this hour? Maybe it's a Jehovah's Witness with the Watchtower with the late scores.
LEADMALE:There's nobody there.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:It might be Claude Rains, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Hey, you! Come back here! No, mister, take good care of him.
LEADFEMALE:Look.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, somebody left a baby on our doorstep.
LEADFEMALE:Somebody would leave a A baby? It's just an egg.
LEADMALE:Just an egg, Mind? Shouldn't we not be prejudiced? Look.
LEADMALE:There's a note down here too.
LEADFEMALE:"I have left my child because I know you'll take good care of it.
LEADFEMALE:You are good, kind, understanding people, especially you, Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:" Let's see, it's about 2:30 a.
SUPMALE:m.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I think that's a good time for an explanation.
SUPFEMALE:All right, Mind, this is merely conjecture, but I'll give it a try.
LEADMALE:A poor, unwed mother is cast out of Boston by her WASP parents.
LEADMALE:"Muffy, Tad and I believe that you have to leave, but we packed your few Lacoste shirts and your penny loafers.
LEADFEMALE:" She wanders around Boston, selling her own hair and a few Springsteen tickets to raise enough money to buy milk for her child.
LEADFEMALE:That's real That's real interesting, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Now, how about the truth? The truth is, Mind, that she was an unwed mother from Thailand whose Buddhist parents said, "Bung How, you have forgot your mantra for the last time.
LEADFEMALE:" The truth.
LEADMALE:Okay, you want the truth, I'll give you the truth, vérité.
OTHERMALE:In your hand you are holding our child.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Enough for tonight.
LEADMALE:It's going back in the refrigerator.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind! The world is cold enough as it is.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy didn't mean that.
SUPMALE:Mork, this would be one of your better jokes, except men don't have babies, and for sure they can't lay eggs.
SUPMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:You know that I am a test-tube child without a navel.
SUPFEMALE:And look, wait a minute, let me show you here.
LEADMALE:What's that? See, Mind, I'm telling you the truth.
SUPMALE:I'm not lying.
LEADMALE:What? Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Well, you mean No.
SUPFEMALE:You mean, you and l? When And I? And then you? And here it is? You should work for Reader's Digest, Mind.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:No, I have to sit down.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:All right, assuming that I am not dreaming and that is our child, what is that gonna be? I don't know, but he's gonna have his own affirmative action program.
OTHERMALE:I don't think there's anything that has happened to me in my life that could possibly prepare me for the fact that that is our child.
OTHERFEMALE:Not even all the Twilight Zones I've watched.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, you told me it wasn't the right time, so I tried to find other parents for it, and then I realized the best parents in the whole world would be you and I.
LEADMALE:Mind, we'd love this.
LEADMALE:I mean, can we keep him? Can we, Mindy? Can we? Well, of course we'll keep it, Mork.
LEADMALE:I mean, I'd love anything you and I made together.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, you weren't too crazy about that bookcase.
LEADMALE:That was different.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, at last we have someone we can cherish and have someone who can test our will.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, someone that we can put medication out of reach of.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, is something wrong? Why would you say that? Well, I've never seen anyone grit their back before.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, there we go! No, everything's great.
LEADMALE:Mind, you're not really too convincing in that.
LEADFEMALE:You sound like Nancy Reagan saying she doesn't spend a lot of money on new dishes.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I don't know, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that I had this insane idea that when you and I decided to plan a family, I would be the one who had the baby.
SUPMALE:I don't know, l Maybe I was I looked forward to knowing that there was a baby inside, and craving strange foods and getting fat, and not being able to see my feet.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mind, come on now.
OTHERMALE:Just because you're not the mother, doesn't mean that it doesn't need your love.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, I know, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, you're gonna be the prettiest, softest father a kid ever had.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I just I just need some time to get used to this.
SUPMALE:It's just pretty strange.
SUPFEMALE:Mind.
OTHERMALE:L - I think you'd better hurry, Mind.
LEADMALE:- Why? Because our child is growing faster than a Russian athlete on steroids.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Didn't know I could knit, huh? It's amazing with a little love how much you can grow.
LEADFEMALE:What is in that egg? I don't know, Mind, but I hope it's healthy.
SUPFEMALE:I just wanna know if it's a boy, girl or pterodactyl.
SUPFEMALE:Pterodactyls are nice, but they're hard to potty-train once they're airborne, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:How can you be so calm? Don't you think that thing is a little gigantic? Well, some people show more than others, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- When do you think it's gonna arrive? - Well, by the look, about 24 hours.
SUPFEMALE:Twenty-four hours! But humans get nine months.
LEADMALE:Elephants get two years.
SUPMALE:I get 24 hours? It takes longer than that to get Peking duck.
LEADMALE:Boy, he can sure kick, Mind.
SUPMALE:Are you related to Bruce Lee? I guess there's not much for me to do at this birth.
SUPFEMALE:Come on now.
LEADMALE:You've gotta be a parent too.
LEADMALE:Now, come over here and touch it.
SUPMALE:Now just pat it.
LEADMALE:You know, put your arms around it.
LEADFEMALE:Have you hugged your egg today? - Oh, Mork, I feel silly.
SUPMALE:- You should.
LEADMALE:I told you to hug an egg.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, come on, come on.
LEADMALE:- It's nice and warm.
LEADMALE:- It should be.
LEADFEMALE:I sat on it all night.
LEADFEMALE:- I can hear a heartbeat.
LEADFEMALE:- Why don't you talk to it? Oh, I don't think so.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on now, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:You talk to your plants including that wandering jew.
SUPMALE:"Where are we today? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:" Hello.
SUPMALE:This is Mindy, your mother.
LEADMALE:Uh, your father.
OTHERMALE:One of your parents.
SUPMALE:I feel like Shari Lewis without Lamb Chop.
LEADMALE:Mind, isn't it wonderful? We're parents now.
SUPFEMALE:We get to say things like, "Don't put that in your mouth! You don't know where it's been!" That's true.
LEADMALE:Mind, have you thought of a name yet? Well, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'd kind of like to name it Beth, after my mother.
LEADMALE:If it's a girl.
SUPFEMALE:And it doesn't have wings.
SUPMALE:I have a certain sentimental attachment Attachment to a name if it's a boy.
SUPFEMALE:- What's that? - Rodan.
SUPMALE:- No, I don't think so.
SUPMALE:- Oh, a little too ethnic? Well, how about Jennifer, or maybe Mustafa Joaquin? Oh, Mork, how are we gonna explain to people that you laid an egg, and we hatched a baby? And only after one month of marriage? We'll tell them we had to get married.
SUPMALE:I've been thinking about this and I think we should keep this our little secret.
LEADFEMALE:- Mind, are you ashamed of our child? - Oh, no.
OTHERMALE:No, Mork, but what if somebody found out it was part alien? Who knows what they'd do to it? And then they'd find out you're an alien and who knows what they'd do to you? Federales! Federales! Shh.
OTHERMALE:Who is it? - A sad and desperate man.
SUPMALE:- Oh, no, it's Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Bickley.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh Uh, we'll be right there.
SUPMALE:We're not decent.
LEADMALE:I don't wanna see you.
SUPMALE:I wanna talk to you.
LEADMALE:- What do we do? - The bedroom.
LEADMALE:No, not now.
LEADFEMALE:We have company, Mind.
SUPMALE:- I meant the egg.
SUPMALE:- I know that.
OTHERMALE:I was trying to give a little comic relief in these moments of tension.
OTHERFEMALE:Easy, easy, gentle, gentle.
SUPMALE:- Mind, Mind, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- Uh, we'll be right there.
SUPMALE:Be careful.
LEADMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:Why do I feel like we're at a company picnic on Saturn, Mind? I'm counting to five.
LEADMALE:Open the door, or I'm climbing into the trash compactor.
LEADMALE:- I think it's beginning to crack.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Mind, I'll stay here with the egg.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's almost time now.
SUPFEMALE:I hope all this rolling around hasn't turned him into a quiche.
LEADMALE:Look, I'll get rid of Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley.
SUPMALE:- What a nice suit.
LEADFEMALE:- Thanks, I'm about to be buried in it.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley, you dropped in at a bad time.
LEADMALE:- I was washing my hair.
LEADMALE:- Please, Mindy, - I don't wanna talk about it.
LEADMALE:- Oh, then I respect your feelings.
SUPFEMALE:- Bye.
SUPFEMALE:- I met Dorinda at a Club Med luau.
LEADFEMALE:The second I laid eyes on her, I knew I had to make her mine.
LEADMALE:Sure, she was a lot younger than me, but she loved older men.
SUPMALE:Oh, it is a nice story, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley, but maybe you can tell me it tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Our romance blossomed, and we decided to get married.
LEADMALE:So last night I took her to meet Dad.
OTHERMALE:That's when the trouble started.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, your father objected? - No, she ran off with him.
LEADFEMALE:That's too bad, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley.
LEADFEMALE:"Too bad"? You call that pity? Where's Mork? Oh, uh Uh, Mork's in the bedroom having breakfast.
LEADFEMALE:Rice Krispies.
LEADMALE:Hi, Bick.
SUPMALE:Nice suit you got there.
SUPMALE:How's life treating you? It all started when I met Dorinda at a Club Med luau.
LEADMALE:She told me she loved What? What is that noise? Oh, I'm just listening to my Exorcist soundtrack.
SUPFEMALE:Little Linda's head is just starting to spin around.
LEADMALE:Mind, could you give me a little moral support and maybe a ball-peen hammer? What's going on in there that's more important than me? No! You don't wanna go in there.
OTHERMALE:- It will only remind you of Dorinda.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, you're right.
LEADMALE:Everything does.
LEADMALE:I'll never be able to look at my family album, or eat suckling pig again.
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley, you've got to know that those gray skies are gonna clear up.
LEADFEMALE:So put on a happy face and remember, there's always more fish in the sea.
LEADFEMALE:But I want a girl just like the girl that ran off with dear old Dad.
SUPMALE:Mindy, I don't wanna upset you, but I think there's a great big nest over there.
SUPFEMALE:- What? - Don't you see it? - Yes.
LEADFEMALE:- What is it? It's a great big nest.
SUPMALE:What the hell is it doing there? Boy, is Mork gonna be upset.
SUPMALE:His pet condor got away.
SUPFEMALE:Why do I come here? It's going to happen.
LEADFEMALE:You don't wanna miss this like you did Beverly Sills at Marineland.
SUPMALE:This is it, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't it much nicer having the baby at home rather than in a hospital? Now, it's important that we don't panic, and if we panic, it's important we're not loud.
LEADFEMALE:I just hope it's healthy.
LEADMALE:I just hope it doesn't eat the bedroom set.
OTHERMALE:- I love you, Mind.
LEADMALE:- I love you too, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:It's a boy.
LEADFEMALE:It's a man! 
SUPMALE:
SUPMALE:I don't believe it.
OTHERFEMALE:Our baby is a full-grown man.
SUPFEMALE:Things like this just don't happen in the Midwest.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call Dad.
LEADFEMALE:He'll know what to do.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, he won't.
LEADFEMALE:That child is astounding.
LEADMALE:Absolutely phenomenal.
LEADFEMALE:This is the first time a baby has ever given me a perfect footprint for the birth certificate.
LEADMALE:Look at that beauty.
LEADFEMALE:Not a smudge on it.
OTHERFEMALE:Great, Exidor.
SUPMALE:That's Dr.
LEADMALE:Exidor.
SUPMALE:Now, I know you have a lot of questions for your pediatrician.
SUPFEMALE:This has got to be the most bizarre thing that's ever happened in my entire life.
OTHERMALE:Don't you think that baby is unusually large? Baby? What baby? Why wasn't I consulted? I'm talking about our baby.
LEADFEMALE:The distinguished-looking gentleman in the diaper.
OTHERMALE:Oh, him.
LEADFEMALE:Rather unique.
LEADFEMALE:He seems so alien.
SUPMALE:I wonder if there's anything Earthling about him.
SUPFEMALE:Why do new parents always ask that question? Your baby is half-Orkan.
LEADFEMALE:That means he's aging backwards, and he has three hearts.
LEADFEMALE:But he does have some human characteristics.
SUPMALE:For instance, he seems to enjoy a good story.
LEADFEMALE:What? Oh, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, I'm a mother.
LEADMALE:Huzzah, huzzah! Here, have one.
LEADMALE:They're Tiparillo lights.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I couldn't have done it without you.
LEADMALE:I couldn't have even lifted him without you.
SUPMALE:This has just all happened so fast.
LEADMALE:I really think we need to talk about this.
LEADMALE:Alone.
OTHERMALE:I suppose I'm not invited to dinner either.
LEADMALE:Well, I've got to finish my paper for the medical journal.
OTHERMALE:Anyway, I'm going to be the best dance critic they ever had.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, I have to admit, he's the most beautiful child you've ever seen.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, wait till you see the little overalls I got him.
OTHERMALE:He looks just like Lester Maddox on steroids.
LEADMALE:Yeah, he's cute, Mork, in a mature sort of way, but our baby isn't exactly what I was expecting.
SUPMALE:Oh, we'll have a girl next time, Mind.
LEADMALE:No, that's not what I meant.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, he's different.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, he has the body of a 50-year-old and the mind of an infant.
SUPMALE:Well, you said you always liked Jerry Lewis.
OTHERMALE:Mork, having a child is difficult under normal circumstances, but, Mork, rhinos have smaller babies.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, do I sense a little note of trepidation there? Now, come on, now, he's a little helpless innocent child.
LEADFEMALE:- Well - Come, there's nothing to be afraid of.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:No, he's just a little nooter.
SUPFEMALE:Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, he can walk.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, he can destroy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, isn't it amazing? Isn't he magnificent? I mean, who ever stood after being only an hour old? Black Beauty.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
OTHERFEMALE:Come to Mama.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, there we go.
LEADMALE:Another one for Baby News.
SUPFEMALE:One more, there we go.
SUPFEMALE:There's one.
OTHERMALE:There One for Parents' World.
SUPMALE:There's another.
LEADMALE:There.
LEADMALE:Now, a little nother one.
LEADMALE:There we go.
LEADMALE:Oh, good, good.
SUPMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:There.
SUPFEMALE:Playboy.
LEADFEMALE:One for Playboy.
LEADFEMALE:There we go.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's okay.
LEADMALE:After Dark.
SUPFEMALE:One for After Dark.
OTHERMALE:Oh, little pooter, little pooter.
OTHERFEMALE:Neener-neener-neener.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind.
LEADMALE:Oh, isn't he the most beautiful? Oh, little pooter, come on, now, pucker up.
LEADMALE:Come over here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, there we go.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa! Oh, Mind, isn't he beautiful? I mean, he's got your eyes and Charles Bronson's beard.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Now, make nice, make nice.
LEADMALE:There.
LEADMALE:Hi there.
SUPFEMALE:I'm your, uh, father.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's nice.
SUPMALE:I think I've thought of a name for him, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh Ow! - No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Here's the name.
LEADFEMALE:Here's the name.
LEADFEMALE:You combine Mork, Mindy and Earth equals Mearth.
OTHERFEMALE:Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth McConnell.
LEADMALE:- Well, it is unusual.
LEADFEMALE:- Right.
SUPFEMALE:But then, so is he.
LEADMALE:Heh, heh.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
SUPFEMALE:No, you have to bite off the tip first.
LEADMALE:No! No, he'll choke on that.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mearth.
SUPFEMALE:Mearth, Mearth, Mearth, look over there.
LEADMALE:Mearth, look.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:He hasn't eaten since he arrived.
OTHERMALE:What do you think he eats? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:He's got all of his teeth.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe a little beef jerky.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, I think he'd rather eat my comforter.
LEADMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:No, Mind, Mind, Mind.
OTHERMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:No, Mind, I think he wants the flowers in the comforter, not the comforter.
LEADFEMALE:- Are you sure? - I know my own son, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Here we go.
OTHERFEMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:Hare Krishna, Hare Lama Hare Krishna Hey there No.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Let's hope there are no bees on there.
OTHERFEMALE:- Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:- Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Bathe the baby, bathe the baby.
LEADFEMALE:I told Mork he wouldn't fit in the sink.
LEADMALE:- Who is it? - It's me, honey.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:Look at you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm just on my way to play a little Dixieland.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, yeah? - So how's the new bride doing? Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:Heh, heh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's an interesting piece of sculpture.
LEADFEMALE:Is it a wedding gift? Oh, no, it's not a present.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, it's a piece of a great big eggshell.
LEADMALE:What was in it, a Buick? Close.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess there's no putting this off any longer.
SUPFEMALE:I've got something to tell you.
OTHERMALE:And I think you better take this sitting down.
SUPFEMALE:Well, okay, honey, fire away.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see, how should I put this? Remember when I was 11 and you told me where babies came from? Yes.
LEADMALE:You lied.
SUPMALE:Well, now, Mindy, I may have glossed over a few major details, but I never lied.
LEADFEMALE:Right, that's true.
OTHERMALE:We've always been truthful with each other, so I'm just gonna lay this right out.
LEADFEMALE:See, for some strange Orkan reason, Mork got pregnant, laid an egg, and now we're parents.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:Boy, I'm glad that's over with.
LEADMALE:Uh, are you trying to tell me that I'm the grandfather of a chicken? No.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, it's a baby.
LEADFEMALE:It's a 6-foot 225-pound middle-aged baby named Mearth.
SUPFEMALE:Are you serious? Dad, don't fall apart on me.
OTHERMALE:You're the only one I can talk to about this.
SUPFEMALE:- Are you serious? - I know it's a shock.
LEADFEMALE:It was for me too.
LEADMALE:I mean, where am I gonna find size 46 Pampers? Where is he? Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, um, uh Mork took him to the park for lunch.
LEADMALE:They're grazing in a flower bed.
SUPFEMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:- To the park? - No, we're going to the airport.
LEADFEMALE:By tomorrow morning, you can be in Brazil.
LEADMALE:Dad, I'm not gonna run away.
LEADMALE:I mean, he's my son.
LEADMALE:I know it's kind of weird now, but I'm sure in enough time, I'll grow to love every hair on his chest.
LEADMALE:Won't I? Well, honey, if that's what you wanna do.
LEADMALE:Oh, sure, you will, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you never were afraid of new experiences.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you married an alien and you went to another planet, and you were the first girl in Boulder to play Little League baseball.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you're right.
LEADMALE:You have to realize that most squirrels don't normally fly like that.
LEADMALE:My God, it is true.
LEADMALE:Say hi to Grandpops.
LEADFEMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:Say "Hi, Grandpa.
LEADFEMALE:" There you go.
LEADMALE:Neener-ner.
SUPMALE:Quick, Mindy, call Air Brazil.
LEADMALE:Well, there he goes again, every hour, on the hour, just like clockwork.
LEADFEMALE:Yep.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll give him his bottle.
LEADFEMALE:But this time, you burp him.
SUPFEMALE:I think I threw my shoulder out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Look, Mork, he tossed out his bottle again.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's your bottle.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
LEADMALE:Powdered.
LEADFEMALE:Powdered? It's not powder, it's He spoke! Oh, Mind, he's a genius.
SUPFEMALE:Our little baby can talky-awky.
OTHERMALE:Don't patronize me.
LEADMALE:Where would he learn such big words? Well, William F.
SUPMALE:Buckley was hosting The Muppets this evening.
LEADMALE:Let me see the quality, the porcine and porcupine quality, of the tiny bubbles as the hands motivate the motion.
OTHERMALE:Mearth, watch Daddy.
LEADMALE:Mearth, what's Daddy bouncing on? - What is it? - Tush.
LEADMALE:I was shooting for bed, but he's right.
LEADFEMALE:Of course he is, Mind.
LEADMALE:He's half a superior being.
LEADMALE:What? All right.
LEADMALE:And who are you? - Who are you? - Mearth.
OTHERFEMALE:- And who am I? - Mommy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Mind, I feel just like Anne Bancroft in The Miracle Worker.
LEADFEMALE:And now the big question, no pressure, though.
SUPFEMALE:- Who's this? - Mm - Shoe.
SUPMALE:- Shoe? Hey, isn't that wonderful, Mind? His first non sequitur.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork, he called me "Shoe.
LEADFEMALE:" - Funny, you don't look Shoeish.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, now.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, now, my little Mearth, my little whiz kid.
LEADMALE:Say "Daddy.
OTHERFEMALE:" Daddy.
LEADMALE:Tired.
LEADMALE:Mind, he's bilingual.
SUPFEMALE:Great, he's bilingual.
LEADMALE:You're Mommy and I'm Shoe.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:He still loves you.
SUPMALE:Besides, he'll be up again in another hour and we'll try again.
LEADFEMALE:- Good night, hon.
SUPMALE:- Good night.
SUPMALE:Night, Mearth.
LEADMALE:You know, Mork, now that he's talking, we're gonna have to be careful no one finds out he's an A-L-I-E-N.
LEADFEMALE:If anyone should find out that Whoa! Mind, what are you doing on the floor? Looks like I got squeezed out.
SUPFEMALE:- I just wanted to cuddle.
OTHERFEMALE:- Aw.
SUPFEMALE:He's just afraid, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:We saw The Shining today, remember? I don't wanna go now.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that's all right.
SUPFEMALE:There's not room for the three of us.
LEADFEMALE:I'll sleep on the couch.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, no, no, you do the honors.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be more comfortable on the couch.
LEADMALE:- Night, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Night, Mind.
SUPMALE:- Night, Mearth.
SUPMALE:- Night, Shoe.
LEADMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:Mork, what happened? Have you been robbed? No, Mearth and I were just playing Morkie Dearest.
SUPMALE:Three-hundred-dollar dress on a wire hanger? - Let me untie you.
LEADFEMALE:- No, no, no, that's all right.
OTHERFEMALE:It's the only way I can sit through Phil Donahue.
LEADMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Mork, little Mearth I mean, big Mearth kind of took me by surprise, but the bottom line is, I am his grandfather.
LEADFEMALE:He's my grandson, so it's about time I started spoiling him.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, football.
SUPFEMALE:He's gonna love that.
SUPFEMALE:- No, Mork, it's baseball.
LEADFEMALE:I knew that.
LEADMALE:That's what you do before you start selling coffee machines.
LEADFEMALE:Well, okay.
LEADFEMALE:So where's the bride? Oh, Pops, you'll be so proud of her.
OTHERMALE:Perfect American father.
LEADFEMALE:She comes home late, never plays with the kids, and brings in the paycheck.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Mork, I don't think you understand what a good father is.
LEADMALE:You see, good fathers wanna be there as much as they can be.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh.
SUPFEMALE:- It's wonderful to watch your children grow up, and it's It's wrong that she's missing it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:On third thought, Pops, I guess you're right.
LEADMALE:If it wasn't for Mr.
LEADMALE:Sternhagen forcing her nose down to the grindstone, she'd be here right now.
OTHERMALE:- What are you talking about? - He asked her to work the night shift.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, no, he didn't, Mork.
LEADMALE:Didn't Mindy tell you that she volunteered for the night shift? Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:I feel like I've gotta sit down.
LEADMALE:Oh, you are sitting.
LEADFEMALE:Just bend your legs.
SUPMALE:How convenient.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy asked to work the night shift? - Do you know what that means? - I'm afraid I do.
LEADMALE:Will you tell me? All right, Mork, I'll try.
SUPFEMALE:Uh I think Mindy is confused and apprehensive about being a parent to Mearth.
SUPFEMALE:What she needs is time to be close to the child, and then love will take care of the rest.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:You're right, Pops.
LEADMALE:No house of mine's gonna become a broken home.
OTHERFEMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, Houdini, watch out.
LEADMALE:Mearth, come on, now.
SUPMALE:We're gonna go find Mindy.
LEADMALE:Well, give me a head start.
SUPMALE:It's gonna take me a while.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Mork, you're not gonna let him go out like that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth, go put on your jacket.
SUPFEMALE:Well, isn't this an exciting feature? We'll be back after this commercial to the KTNS Science Fiction Festival and the dramatic conclusion of It Came From Diablo Canyon.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go, come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, I got here as fast as I could.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, what are you doing here? And why is Mearth up so late? I have to make a report to O-R-S-O-N.
OTHERFEMALE:- About what? - Sagittarian women.
LEADMALE:What? Wait.
OTHERFEMALE:- Mind, I can't talk.
LEADFEMALE:- You can't leave him here like this.
LEADMALE:Take care of him.
LEADFEMALE:Take care of him.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mearth.
LEADMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:So, Mearth, where did Mommy take you for lunch today? To a Japanese restaurant, and I had tempura and sashimi and bonsai tree.
LEADFEMALE:Bonsai tree? Oh, yeah, that sounds nutritious.
OTHERFEMALE:So, what do you think of where Daddy works? Pathetic.
LEADFEMALE:I have better stuff than this in my room.
LEADFEMALE:Fake.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, don't touch that.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy didn't mean to scare you.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that Daddy's rocket ship is not a toy.
OTHERMALE:When's Mommy coming back? Well, soon, I hope.
LEADMALE:Mearth, you have on your pitcher's mitt upside down.
LEADFEMALE:Here, let me help you.
LEADFEMALE:Did Mommy teach you how to play baseball? No? You put it on right Give me your Here, give me your hand.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Mearth, look over there.
LEADFEMALE:Now, give me your hand.
LEADFEMALE:Help me.
LEADFEMALE:Want me to teach you how to play catch? Yeah? Okay.
SUPMALE:Come over here and Daddy will teach you how to play catch.
OTHERFEMALE:Whew.
LEADMALE:Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth, we're gonna I'm gonna throw the ball, and you catch it, okay? Okay? Now, you keep your eye on the ball.
LEADMALE:Mearth, watch the ball and catch the ball.
LEADMALE:Here you go.
LEADFEMALE:One, two, three.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh! Mearth, look over there.
LEADFEMALE:What's that? What's that over there? Yeah.
LEADMALE:We're gonna try this again.
LEADMALE:Whew.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's all right.
LEADFEMALE:Tickle, tickle, tickle.
SUPMALE:This time I'm gonna throw it, and you catch it in the mitt, okay? You catch it in the mitt.
LEADMALE:Okay? Here we go.
SUPMALE:Watch the ball.
LEADMALE:One, two, three.
OTHERMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:And they call this the national pastime? Mearth.
SUPMALE:This time, Daddy knows you're gonna catch the ball.
LEADFEMALE:Put the mitt like this, okay? Here we go.
LEADMALE:One, two, three.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, he caught the ball! - Oh! Ah! Daddy.
LEADMALE:Daddy, Daddy, Daddy - What'd you say? - Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:That's great, son.
LEADFEMALE:- You did real good.
LEADFEMALE:Wanna try again? - No.
LEADFEMALE:Room for one more? Mork, I'll bet there wasn't an emergency at all, was there? Yes, there was, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't feel part of the family.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I have been running away.
OTHERFEMALE:But you know what? I'm gonna quit this night job so I can spend all my time with you two.
LEADMALE:Oh, this is a wonderful moment.
SUPMALE:We're so much happier than the Jeffersons.
SUPFEMALE:You know what would make me really happy? If Mearth would call me Mommy.
SUPMALE:Mearth? Mearth.
OTHERFEMALE:Mommy, Mearth.
SUPFEMALE:- Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:- Mommy.
SUPMALE:- Mommy.
OTHERFEMALE:- Mm-hm.
LEADMALE:Daddy.
LEADMALE:Shoe.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Your Grandioseness.
SUPMALE:Hello, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You seem to be in an unusually good mood.
LEADFEMALE:Hitting the ginger ale again? Oh, no, sir.
LEADMALE:I'm high on life.
SUPFEMALE:Just hold on to your fish sticks.
LEADMALE:I had a baby boy.
SUPMALE:A baby? What a completely outdated concept.
LEADMALE:Oh, sir, come on, now.
LEADMALE:I know you're gonna love him because judging by your size, he could be yours.
LEADFEMALE:Sir, I just happen to have a few photographs here with me.
LEADFEMALE:Can I show them to you, please? Here they go.
SUPMALE:Eh-ee.
LEADMALE:Here he is at 2 hours old.
LEADMALE:He seems very alert for a child his age.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, sir.
SUPMALE:Eh-ee.
LEADMALE:Here is his first piggyback ride.
SUPFEMALE:And here's a family portrait.
LEADMALE:Eh-ee.
SUPFEMALE:This one was snapped just before we were airborne.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mork, I must admit, he is rather exceptional.
SUPMALE:Oh, sir, I'm glad you think so.
OTHERMALE:Because Mindy and I want you to be the godfather.
LEADMALE:Me? Absolutely not.
OTHERFEMALE:I am not getting involved in your barbaric Earthling matters.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I see.
SUPFEMALE:He does look a little like me, doesn't he? Well, sir, especially around the equator.
SUPMALE:Oh, a check.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you, godfather.
SUPMALE:Mm-mm.
SUPMALE:Oh, sir.
LEADMALE:Oh, this will assure him of a college education, or at least a hamburger and some onion rings.
SUPFEMALE:Until next week, sir, na-no.
SUPFEMALE:A buck thirty? Such a big man, and he gives so little.
SUPMALE:Well, it's been about two and a half hours since we've seen Superman.
SUPMALE:I think it's about time you guys came in for a landing.
OTHERMALE:Come on, Mom, you can join in with us.
SUPFEMALE:Just because you're a girl, you know, we won't make fun of you.
SUPFEMALE:- You can fly just like we can.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah, Mind.
LEADMALE:Lots of women can fly.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, look at this: There's Tinker Bell, there was Grace Slick.
LEADFEMALE:There was, I mean, Amelia Earhart.
LEADMALE:She still may be up there, but her luggage always arrived.
LEADFEMALE:Even the Wright Brothers came down for milk and cookies, Mearth.
OTHERMALE:Oh! So you liked your first movie, huh, Mearth? Well, I really did enjoy the movies.
LEADFEMALE:You know something, I've been thinking, Mom.
LEADMALE:Now, as I understand it, - Superman has two jobs, right? - That's correct.
LEADFEMALE:- Okay.
LEADFEMALE:And Mommy has one job.
OTHERFEMALE:- Correct.
LEADMALE:And Daddy watches General Hospital.
LEADMALE:Well, no comment.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, Mearth, your daddy has a job.
LEADFEMALE:He watches you.
OTHERMALE:Not during General Hospital.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, you know something? I hope when I grow up I'll be just like Superman.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you wanted to grow up to be just like me.
SUPFEMALE:Why? - Oh, Mearth - Take it out real slow, son, real slow.
SUPMALE:Mearth, your dad's wonderful.
LEADMALE:No, come on, that's all right.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take it over.
LEADMALE:Son, I have lots of wonderful qualities.
OTHERMALE:I'm prompt, I'm Jump in any time, Mind.
SUPMALE:Your father is loving and special and unique.
LEADMALE:- Yeah, but he can't fly.
LEADFEMALE:- Just because I can't fly doesn't mean I don't have a lot in common with Superman.
LEADMALE:I mean Well, I mean, he's an alien from the planet Krypton and Does the planet Ork mean anything to you? Whoo.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, Mearth, I think it's way past your bedtime.
LEADMALE:So why don't you take your milk and cookies and go upstairs and put on your Dr.
SUPMALE:Denton's? - Okay.
SUPFEMALE:- Okay? Oh, boy, back up to that Fortress of Solitude.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, I tell you, I'm gonna really plug in that electric blanket tonight and, mm, watch kitty go "rawr!" Mork, I thought you agreed that we wouldn't tell Mearth you're an alien until he gets younger.
SUPFEMALE:I know, but he's been talking up that guy in the tights again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, listen, I mean, even Superman can't do this.
LEADFEMALE:Watch.
LEADFEMALE:Eee Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Tsk.
LEADFEMALE:- Mind, I bet he can't do the carioca.
LEADFEMALE:- The what? Got the carioca Mork, you don't have to prove anything.
LEADFEMALE:You have your son's respect.
LEADMALE:Listen, all kids go through a form of hero worship.
LEADFEMALE:Believe me, it'll pass.
LEADMALE:I guess you're right.
LEADMALE:But just to be on the safe side, from now on, I'm only gonna take him to hear Slim Whitman sing Aida.
LEADMALE:What you doing, Mind? Oh, just brushing my hair and making some notes.
LEADFEMALE:Doing that both at the same time? Boy, you're one up on Gerald Ford.
LEADMALE:What are the notes for? Well, Governor Lamm is taking a skiing vacation up in Aspen, and Dewey Fishbeck's going up to interview him, so they asked me to write questions for him to ask the governor.
LEADFEMALE:How come he's not writing his own? Well, Dewey's the anchorman.
SUPMALE:All he knows how to do is joke about the weatherman's sports coat.
LEADFEMALE:Well, time for me to hit the old sack.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just gonna leave the light on for a few more minutes, okay? Oh, that's all right with me, Mind.
LEADMALE:I've slept through an eclipse.
LEADMALE:Heh, heh.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, you know Ugh! Can't sleep.
SUPFEMALE:Insomnia! Oh, oh.
LEADMALE:The restless Oh, the tossing, the turning.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you know what's wrong, Mind? I don't have my little guy's respect up there, and R-E-S-P-E-C-T, that's what it means to me.
LEADMALE:He's just infatuated with a movie.
LEADFEMALE:Just like you were with the midget wrestlers.
LEADMALE:Terry the Teeney Terror didn't have a spit curl and red boots.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, will you forget the movie? You have your son's respect.
SUPMALE:No, I don't, Mind, and why should I? I mean, you bring home the bacon.
SUPMALE:All I do is collect the grease.
LEADMALE:You have the biggest responsibility of all, raising a child.
OTHERMALE:Gloria Steinem didn't buy that one, Mind, and neither do I.
SUPMALE:I mean, I want my son to look up to me.
SUPFEMALE:Even though he does have the height advantage.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, I've gotta go out and get myself a job, a legitimate job.
OTHERMALE:Mork, you already have a job, and that's being an observer for Ork.
LEADFEMALE:My gosh, that's like being an ambassador to the entire planet.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but I can't tell anybody, especially my own son, Mearth.
LEADMALE:I mean, Mind, I want to have a job I can talk about.
OTHERMALE:I mean, come home and complain about the boss, hang around the water cooler, chat with friends, flirt with my secretary, get drunk at the Christmas party and make a fool out of myself.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, something a son can really respect.
LEADMALE:Mork, listen, if your mind's made up, it's fine with me.
SUPFEMALE:I just want you to realize it's not that easy to get a good job.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, I am a superior being.
SUPMALE:I mean, I can get any job I want, and if by some fluke of fate I can't, well, I can always write a diet book.
LEADMALE:- Hi.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:Little boodle bugger.
LEADFEMALE:What a day it is outside, huh? I mean, I'm talking about blue, blue, blue sky, Paul Newman blue, you know, like "bing.
SUPFEMALE:" It stretches all the way to the Flatirons.
SUPMALE:If John Denver isn't writing a song now, he's missing a million-seller.
LEADMALE:Yeah, mm-hm.
LEADFEMALE:Good day job-hunting? Oh, heh.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, the possibilities are infinite.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh.
LEADMALE:- I've narrowed it down to two things: Either giving blood every day for the rest of my life or the job at Remtec of nocturnal surveillance official.
SUPFEMALE:Nocturnal sur Could that be anything like night watchman? Oh, well, that's a generic term, yes, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I know the profit sharing, the pension plan, the perks aren't what they should be, but I do get along very well with the Doberman.
LEADMALE:Well, at least you have options.
OTHERMALE:Yes, oh, Mind, Mind, it's so good to know that I can expand my knowledge into so many fields and have the ultimate security and confidence to carry on like that.
LEADFEMALE:And what is one suitcase packed and ready to go? Well, I have to go away for the weekend to Aspen.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's fine, Mind.
LEADMALE:I'm about to lose my son's respect for life, and you're off barrel jumping with Peggy and Rhonda Fleming.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, it's a business trip.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're deserting me for business, Mind.
SUPMALE:That makes me feel a heck of a lot better.
SUPFEMALE:I thought it was personal.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, come on.
LEADMALE:I love you, and I'm not deserting you, and here comes Mearth.
LEADMALE:We'll talk about it later.
OTHERMALE:- Hi, Mearth.
OTHERFEMALE:- Hello, son, hello.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute, pilgrims.
LEADFEMALE:Just stay away from that water hole.
LEADFEMALE:It's contaminated.
LEADFEMALE:And don't fill your canteens until I tell you.
LEADMALE:Mork, I think his voice is changing.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Mearth, do you have a frog in your throat? No.
LEADFEMALE:I have John Wayne in my throat and I have a frog in my pocket.
LEADMALE:Daddy, I wanna ask you something.
SUPFEMALE:I was upstairs watching TV - and I saw a Western.
SUPMALE:- Hmm.
LEADMALE:I wanna ask you, have you ever? Have you ever strung up Well, I once stopped a lady in the express line who had too many items.
LEADMALE:Boy, I bet everybody at the supermarket sure thanked your daddy.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, I was wondering, is somebody going bye-bye? - Yeah, I am.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh.
LEADMALE:See, Dewey Fishbeck had an allergic reaction to his toupee, and his head is covered in hives, and so I have to go to Aspen to interview the governor.
OTHERFEMALE:Interview the governor? Oh, my gosh, that is important.
OTHERMALE:Daddy's doing something important.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy's making macaroni tonight with cheese.
LEADFEMALE:- Mm! - Mm.
LEADMALE:Not nearly as important as what you're doing.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's American cheese.
SUPMALE:Oh, American cheese, Mearth.
LEADMALE:Boy, I wish I could stay here with you and your daddy and have macaroni.
OTHERMALE:Mom, go on and see the governor.
SUPFEMALE:Incidentally, do you think you could get his autograph? And if you can't, I'd just as soon have yours.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth, could you help Mommy by taking her skis down to the car? It'll be an honor.
LEADMALE:Now, Mork, I don't want you to overreact.
OTHERMALE:He's just a child, and he's easily impressed.
LEADFEMALE:Tomorrow his hero will be Reggie Jackson.
LEADMALE:Oh, good, another person I can't compete with.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I really feel like I should stay.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't be silly.
SUPMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:I mean, you know, I'm the eternal optimist.
OTHERMALE:I can be down right now.
LEADMALE:Life's just a seesaw.
OTHERFEMALE:I can be down one moment and then, whoop, back up again.
LEADMALE:Hello? Speaking.
SUPFEMALE:Remtec Corporation? Shh, shh, shh.
LEADMALE:I scored very high on the IQ test? I had to play dumb.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:The personnel director liked me? Nothing can stop me now, Mind, I got it.
LEADFEMALE:Nee-nee-nee Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hm.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:You did it, Mork, you did it.
SUPFEMALE:What makes you say that, Mind? Well, you just said that the personnel director liked you and you scored highly on the IQ test.
LEADFEMALE:Well, when they put my personality profile through the computer, they found out if they left me alone with a Doberman that he'd bite my head off and bark down my neck.
SUPFEMALE:Well, by the time you come back from your trip, our son will have finally disowned me, so you take care and have a nice time.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, would you give me a hand? Oh, hi, hi, little pooter, - I missed you.
SUPFEMALE:- I missed you too Oh! Don't touch me there.
SUPFEMALE:I've got a bruise.
SUPMALE:- Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, don't touch me there either.
SUPMALE:- Another bruise? - No, the same one.
LEADFEMALE:It goes all the way around.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:You know, everybody always told me I was a good skier, but Governor Lamm makes Jean-Claude Killy look like a snow bunny.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:It sounds like you were skiing over your head.
SUPFEMALE:I was skiing on my head.
LEADFEMALE:The governor suggested that we start out on something called Tammy's Run.
LEADMALE:I figured, how difficult can anything be named Tammy? Well, that's before I found out it was named after the late Tammy Ericson.
OTHERMALE:You ski right past her headstone.
SUPMALE:You can't miss it.
LEADFEMALE:And I didn't.
LEADMALE:- Come here, little pooter.
LEADFEMALE:- Thanks.
LEADMALE:Well, compared to us, you had a swell time.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean? Is Mearth all right? Well, yes.
LEADMALE:He didn't stir-fry his toys or anything, but I think I should start at the beginning so you can understand how innocently this disaster started.
LEADMALE:Disaster? Oh, Mork, don't tell me about a disaster.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Armageddon.
LEADFEMALE:While you were off gallivanting with the governor, I felt about as useless as a lawnmower on AstroTurf.
LEADMALE:It was a very crisp, clear day, and it began very innocently with a breakfast of fresh fruit and hog jowls.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, will you get to the point? Come on, I was just trying to set the mood.
LEADMALE:I mean, no wonder the novel is dead as an art form.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it all started off with a simple lesson in geography.
LEADMALE:And then the wheels of catastrophe started to turn.
LEADMALE:Now show me a country where it's legal to marry your livestock.
LEADFEMALE:- Let's see, right here.
SUPFEMALE:- Yes, that's right, India.
SUPMALE:If we can't eat them, at least we'll make them part of the family.
LEADMALE:- All right.
SUPFEMALE:- I don't wanna play geography anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:I really don't.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna play hide-and-seek.
LEADFEMALE:Well, no, we have to do our lessons.
SUPMALE:Okay, then if we have to do our lessons, where's Metropolis? Where does Superman live? Huh.
LEADMALE:All right, as the world turns, let's play hide-and-seek.
SUPMALE:Okay, tell you what, we can combine the two.
LEADMALE:We'll combine geography and hide-and-seek.
LEADMALE:I'll be Russia and you play a small third-world country and I'll have to find and dominate you through military and economic aid.
SUPMALE:Here we go, ready? Okay, here we go.
LEADMALE:You promise to keep your eyes closed, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:- All right.
SUPFEMALE:- Please.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, what's this? Well, that's my space Oh.
SUPMALE:Well, what do you think it is, son? Well, it's the most attractive costume I've ever seen.
SUPMALE:Look at this, how beautiful, and this, whatever it is, this diamond pointing down towards the man's shoes.
LEADFEMALE:Gosh, and look at this on the back.
LEADFEMALE:The same diamond pointing down to his shoes in the back.
LEADMALE:It's incredible.
SUPMALE:Are you trying to tell me that this doesn't belong to a superhero? Let's not jump to any conclusions, son.
LEADMALE:Maybe someone sang with the Commodores, you don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Please, come on, Dad, you can level with me.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you know, I'm not Lois Lane or anything like that.
OTHERMALE:I'm your son, Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, tell me the truth.
SUPFEMALE:All right, son, well, I'll level with you.
LEADFEMALE:The truth is this is mine, but I'm not now or never have been a superhero.
SUPMALE:Oh, gee.
LEADMALE:Not another major depression.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't handle I've had four today.
SUPMALE:Well, son, son, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:It doesn't mean that I can't be a superhero.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's a perfect job for me.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I could be my own boss.
LEADFEMALE:The hours are perfect.
LEADMALE:How's this sound to you, son? How about this? Mork McConnell, crime-fighter.
LEADMALE:Does that make you proud? Why, it sure does.
SUPMALE:Son, that's what I've been waiting to hear.
LEADMALE:- Then you've got it.
SUPMALE:- Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Could I go out there and battle evil with you? All right, but if you see any criminals from the Phantom Zone or any large farmers from the central time zone, you just find someplace safe and watch your daddy swing into action.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, I'm so proud to be able to serve with you.
LEADMALE:Oh, son.
LEADMALE:Son, don't you worry about a thing.
LEADMALE:- Whew.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:- Ha, ha.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna go back there and change into my superhero costume.
LEADFEMALE:- Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Dad.
LEADMALE:- Don't worry about a thing.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a little cold outside, son.
LEADFEMALE:You think it would tarnish my image if I wore Mommy's muff? I wouldn't wear the muff.
LEADMALE:I really wouldn't wear the muff, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:You're still my hero, but don't wear the muff, okay? See that, son? Never too old for nap time.
LEADMALE:Come on in here, get a quick cold drink, and get on our way.
LEADMALE:I don't know, Dad.
LEADMALE:We've been walking around for two days.
SUPMALE:Gee, we haven't seen one decent crime.
OTHERMALE:You know, Superman flies.
LEADMALE:It's a bummer having to ride the bus.
LEADFEMALE:Superman can't make exact change like we can.
LEADMALE:Who in the hell are you? Well, just two ordinary people trying to take a fashion risk.
LEADFEMALE:We'd like two milks, please.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, incidentally, could I have a glass with Fred Flintstone on it? I think we had some milk around here once.
LEADFEMALE:I'll check and see if it's still liquid.
LEADMALE:This is the kind of place we might find a man who will violate law and the American way.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Dad, God bless you.
SUPMALE:You sound just like Steve Garvey.
LEADFEMALE:All right, now, what's with you? Who are you, anyway? I'm Mork McConnell, crime-fighter and part-time superhero.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:And who are you, Wonder Woman? I happen to be Mearth, his important sidekick.
LEADFEMALE:Just give me a straight answer, just a straight simple answer, before somebody here hands you your kneecaps on a platter.
OTHERMALE:Come on, Dave.
SUPFEMALE:It ain't worth it.
LEADMALE:Listen, you guys don't belong here.
SUPMALE:You could get hurt.
OTHERFEMALE:Take a hike.
LEADMALE:There's a bar down the street that caters to superheroes, okay? I can't go there.
LEADMALE:You see, I'm not union.
LEADMALE:Oh, son, come on, now, I think there's a lot of tension in here.
SUPFEMALE:Let's check out the jukebox and see if they have the love theme from Alien.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Dave, how are you doing? - Charlie, how are you? - All right, how about a beer? I don't think I'd be hanging here.
SUPFEMALE:There been some people asking questions about you.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, don't worry about me.
LEADMALE:Nobody finds me unless I want them to find me.
LEADFEMALE:- Wrong again, Charlie.
OTHERFEMALE:- Heh-heh-heh.
LEADMALE:Heh-heh-heh.
LEADMALE:We figured you'd show up sooner or later.
LEADMALE:Daddy, he's got a gun.
SUPFEMALE:- Do something.
SUPMALE:- You're right, son.
LEADFEMALE:Well, do something! Hold it right there! How about you dropping that gun before I hand you my kneecaps on a platter? Hey, thank you, partner.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no sweat.
LEADFEMALE:Will someone now call a policeman? I'm a policeman.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this is gonna be a black mark on your record, Dad, if you go through with this.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like I'm gonna have to split town again, but I'm a little short on cash, so Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Dave, will you empty the till? And everybody else, you empty your pockets.
LEADMALE:- I don't have any pockets.
LEADMALE:- Ah.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Then you get to collect all the cash.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my pleasure, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Lovely seven and three-quarters.
LEADMALE:- Donations are greatly appreciated.
LEADMALE:- Dad, Dad, I plead with you.
LEADFEMALE:Don't do this.
SUPMALE:That cap is filthy.
SUPMALE:You don't know where it's been.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, the money you're taking from these guys, I'm sure Son, now, please, son, please.
LEADFEMALE:Now, that's a criminal over there with a gun, and the surgeon general has determined bullets can be hazardous to your health.
SUPMALE:Now, please.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not Superman Thank you very much.
LEADMALE:- And even if I was, I wouldn't want to see you or these people hurt.
OTHERMALE:Now, son, please, please.
SUPMALE:I'm not a coward.
LEADMALE:Hey! Who said you could move? He was just helping me, that's all.
SUPMALE:Shut up! I told you, empty the pockets.
LEADMALE:All I have is a frog in my right pocket.
SUPMALE:Please, he's telling you the truth, Charlie.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm a nonviolent person.
SUPFEMALE:Here, take your money and go.
OTHERMALE:Leave us all alone.
LEADMALE:Hey, I happen to be a violent person, so shut up.
SUPFEMALE:- I told you, empty the pockets.
LEADFEMALE:- Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Stop that.
SUPFEMALE:I'm warning you.
SUPFEMALE:I want those pockets turned inside out.
LEADMALE:What have you got to hide? - Ow! - Nobody, nobody, hurts my family.
OTHERFEMALE:What's doing this? What the hell is going on here? Daddy, what happened? I don't know, son.
LEADFEMALE:We'll just hope it never happens again.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, you're safe now.
LEADMALE:Let's go home.
OTHERMALE:You know something? They said Chicago was the Windy City.
OTHERFEMALE:Then the newspaper reported that a freak tornado touched down in a small bar.
SUPMALE:It was really scary, Mind.
SUPMALE:I mean, I didn't know I had that kind of rage inside of me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm afraid of what'll happen the next time I open a pistachio and there's no nut.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Mork, you were protecting Mearth.
SUPFEMALE:But I only wanted his respect and put him in a dangerous situation.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:You did take it too far, but it's normal to want respect from Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, I have so much respect for you.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mearth.
LEADMALE:Mearth, I missed you.
LEADFEMALE:I was gone for two days.
LEADMALE:You, I know, I know, I know.
LEADMALE:Gosh, you know, while you were gone, - how brave Daddy was.
SUPFEMALE:- I heard.
LEADFEMALE:He took a gun away from a criminal.
SUPMALE:He did, he did.
LEADMALE:And he didn't even muss his hair during the tornado.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess I owe it all to Ann Miller's hair spray.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, you're so great.
SUPFEMALE:See, Mork? You've been searching for something you had all along.
SUPMALE:- You really mean it, son? - Of course I do.
LEADFEMALE:You're everything to me.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you play with me, you read to me, we watch TV together.
LEADMALE:We're together all day long.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Mearth, I mean, what about Superman? He's a joke.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't mean anything to me.
LEADFEMALE:He's a fake.
LEADFEMALE:He's fictitious.
SUPFEMALE:Mearth, why don't you tell Daddy who your new hero is? Oh, come on, Mind, he doesn't have to, really.
SUPMALE:I will.
LEADMALE:It's the governor.
LEADMALE:I got that from you, Dad.
SUPMALE:That's your sense of humor.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Come in Hola.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, excuse me, Ola.
SUPFEMALE:I must have the wrong mind.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm looking for Orson.
OTHERMALE:Orson no in casa.
SUPFEMALE:This is his housekeeper, Keezbalita.
OTHERMALE:Keezbalita, could you turn off the vacuum? Oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:That's much better.
SUPMALE:But where's Orson? He's no in casa.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I have a report for him, Keezbalita.
LEADFEMALE:I can take a message.
LEADFEMALE:Well, will you tell him, please, that Mork called, and that this week I learned that fathers put too much pressure on themselves to be the apple of their child's eye? They should be concentrating on being loved for what they are, not what they think that they should be.
OTHERFEMALE:- Did you get that? - You bet.
SUPFEMALE:I tell Orson Monty called.
LEADMALE:Na-no.
LEADMALE:I work five hours on a report, and somebody named Monty gets all the credit.
LEADFEMALE:Well, patience, patience.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry, Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy and I won't be home too late.
LEADMALE:You're obviously deserting me.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, I bet I know who that is.
LEADMALE:It's Grandma.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you're gonna have so much fun with her.
SUPFEMALE:No, we're not.
LEADMALE:All she does is wanna play canasta.
LEADMALE:I'm going to hide.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:You hide on Grandma.
SUPFEMALE:- Hi.
SUPMALE:- Hello, dear.
OTHERFEMALE:- Thanks for skipping your yoga class.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, it's my pleasure, dear.
SUPMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:Mindy.
OTHERMALE:- That dress is a knockout.
LEADFEMALE:- Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:You're going to be the hit of your high school reunion.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I hope so.
OTHERMALE:To tell you the truth, I'm a little nervous, though.
SUPFEMALE:I really haven't kept up with anybody except Glenda Faye.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know if I'll have anything in common with anyone else.
LEADMALE:No, I suppose that may be true.
SUPMALE:Yes.
OTHERMALE:You're married to a spaceman, you have a full-grown son No, I don't think you'll have anything in common.
OTHERMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPFEMALE:But I'm dying to find out what happened to everybody.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, now, where's my little Mearth? Oh, I don't know, Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry he isn't here.
SUPMALE:Why, it's too bad, because I have a special treat for him.
SUPFEMALE:A special treat? You know, I have brought him a great big delicious, mouth-watering salad.
LEADMALE:Ugh.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, salads are for bunnies.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mearth, I'm only kidding.
LEADMALE:Look, I brought you a ton, a whole ton, of brownies.
OTHERMALE:I guess so.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:Now I think about it, I guess you're just about my favorite babysitter.
SUPMALE:Then when I really think about it, you're the only babysitter I've ever known.
SUPMALE:Ho! My team is red-hot Your team ain't doodley-squat Kick them like a horse Kick them like a donkey Come on, now Let's beat those honkies! Where did you find my old cheerleading sweater? Where you hid it.
LEADFEMALE:Last night when you were trying it on, you thought I was asleep.
LEADMALE:You were like this: I didn't do that.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, you sure did.
OTHERFEMALE:- I did not.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes, you did.
SUPMALE:No way, no way, no way.
OTHERMALE:If you're going to go, you'd better shake a leg.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're right, Gram.
LEADMALE:Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth, now, we want you to be a good boy, and you mind Grandma, okay? I will, but you have to promise me that I can dye Grandma's hair.
OTHERMALE:- No.
SUPFEMALE:- I wanna dye her hair.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:That's what we're talking about.
SUPMALE:Now, be a good boy.
LEADMALE:And we'll call later - to make sure everything's all right.
OTHERMALE:- Okay.
LEADFEMALE:- We'll be here.
LEADMALE:- Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry about a thing, dear, and have lots of fun.
OTHERMALE:- Just go for it.
OTHERFEMALE:- Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:We'll do everything she used to do in high school.
LEADFEMALE:We'll forge hall passes, we'll TP the hallways, we'll abuse substitute teachers.
SUPMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPMALE:I never did stuff like that in high school.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, in that case we'll just date the entire football team.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:Be a good boy.
LEADFEMALE:- I will, I will.
LEADMALE:- If you can't be good, be reasonable.
OTHERFEMALE:And Daddy loves you.
LEADFEMALE:- Whoo.
SUPFEMALE:- Ooh.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I know you.
SUPMALE:Mindy.
SUPMALE:Mindy McConnell, right? I'd recognize you anywhere.
SUPFEMALE:- He one of your old boyfriends, Mind? - No.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Dickie Nimitz, this is my husband, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Gosh, you married Mindy? She wouldn't even go to the library with me.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh.
LEADFEMALE:- She wouldn't go with me unless I married her first.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADMALE:Well, I couldn't make that kind of commitment.
LEADMALE:- Well, here's your badges right here.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Don't get them mixed up and wear each other's.
LEADMALE:Now that we're great pals, we should start hanging out together again.
LEADMALE:How about the library tomorrow? - Oh, sure, we'd love to - But we can't.
LEADFEMALE:My library card expired.
LEADFEMALE:- See you later, Dickie.
LEADMALE:- Yeah, excuse me for living.
OTHERMALE:Oh, here they are, Mr.
LEADMALE:And Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Snugglepuss.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, you said there wouldn't be a natural blond here.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're such a little pudding face.
OTHERMALE:- Can you believe we're here? - No.
LEADMALE:Isn't this weird? Don't you feel we should be putting on our gym suits and playing a game of dodge ball? God.
SUPMALE:Ten years and nothing's changed.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh! Mindy! Mindy McConnell! - Who are you? - Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy's Mindy's better half, the yin for her yang.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, smuggling basketballs, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Boyce? Yeah, this is my husband, and you're, uh, pregnant! - There's Dickie Nimitz.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:We used to have so much fun in the library together.
LEADFEMALE:- Aah! - Dickie! Dickie Nimitz! - Who was that? - Althea Flyly.
SUPMALE:- Althea Flyly.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:She played the lute in the marching band.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh! - Remember? No.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess some things have changed.
LEADMALE:But you haven't.
SUPFEMALE:Have I? Well, you don't wear that headband quite so much anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Uh Uh, how about some punch? Oh, no, thanks.
LEADMALE:I'm hypoglycaemic.
LEADMALE:- I meant for me.
LEADFEMALE:- Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Not sure you're gonna like it.
LEADMALE:Someone dumped some old fruit in there.
OTHERFEMALE:It's kind of brown and I'll go.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:He's here.
LEADFEMALE:Who's here? Don't you try and play cool with me.
SUPMALE:It's Steve.
SUPMALE:Steve Sanders.
OTHERMALE:Go talk to him.
SUPMALE:I know you're dying to.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you wore his ID bracelet for two years.
LEADMALE:But I haven't seen him in ten years.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't know what to say Hi, Steve.
OTHERFEMALE:Thirty-three left, - Pardon me? - Your old locker combination, Mindy.
LEADMALE:- Oh, my gosh.
LEADMALE:- Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:He remembers your locker combo.
LEADFEMALE:How romantic.
LEADFEMALE:If that really makes your toes tingle, this'll really knock your socks off.
LEADFEMALE:This is our zip code.
SUPFEMALE:It's, um, 80 - Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh.
LEADMALE:Darn, I had it.
LEADFEMALE:Steve, this is my husband, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh.
LEADMALE:- For sure, totally and what it was.
SUPMALE:I've seen you somewhere before, haven't I? Maybe you went to Fairview, wasn't it? No, I went to Chester A School for Boys.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:There goes Tommy Perozzi.
LEADFEMALE:- Remember? Bad skin, great car.
LEADMALE:- Ha, ha.
OTHERFEMALE:So, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:- Hard to believe it's been ten years.
SUPMALE:- I know.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me everything.
SUPMALE:- Well, I got married.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADMALE:- Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:- Wing.
OTHERMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPMALE:- Ha, ha.
SUPFEMALE:And, uh, well, I went into journalism.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, I'm working at KTNS.
LEADMALE:- Oh.
SUPFEMALE:- I do the news sometimes.
LEADFEMALE:But mostly I just assist the manager.
SUPMALE:Stuff like that.
LEADMALE:Well, what are you doing? Me? Oh, well, I'm still single, and right now I'm lieutenant governor of Wyoming.
LEADFEMALE:- Wow.
LEADFEMALE:- Lieutenant.
SUPFEMALE:Mm! I didn't even know Wyoming had an army.
LEADFEMALE:So you don't mind if we have a dance for old times' sake, do you? Oh, no, take my wife, please.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:See you.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, have her back by 2.
SUPFEMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPMALE:Hey, Mork! Mork! Steve and Mindy, together again.
LEADFEMALE:Just like the senior prom.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, there they go! Smooch, smooch, smooch.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPFEMALE:That's all they ever did in school.
LEADMALE:Once I caught them necking behind the library.
OTHERFEMALE:Steve beat me up.
SUPMALE:But I respected him for it.
SUPFEMALE:I was a creep in those days.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPFEMALE:- Time sure does fly, doesn't it? - Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPMALE:Aren't you even jealous? How can you just sit here and watch your marriage dissolve? Oh, pshaw.
LEADMALE:I mean, I trust Mindy farther than I can throw her.
LEADMALE:I mean, I don't have a jealous bone in my body.
LEADMALE:But I'm willing to rent one.
SUPMALE:Okay, here we go.
SUPMALE:Now, Evel, you get $50 million if you clear the three boxes.
SUPFEMALE:Okay? Got it, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Vroom.
SUPFEMALE:I hope he makes it.
SUPMALE:Don't you? Don't you? Don't you? He made it.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, how long are you gonna keep this up? It's just silly.
SUPFEMALE:Silly? Last night I saw a side of you that I rarely ever see, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh.
SUPMALE:What side? - Your back.
SUPFEMALE:Because your front was too busy talking to Steve.
LEADMALE:Mommy, are you and Daddy fighting? - Yes.
LEADMALE:- No, Mearth, sweetie.
LEADMALE:Your dad and I are just having a little disagreement.
LEADMALE:We really love each other very much.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, your mom and I love each other very, very much, but that's why we have to be alone for a moment.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you go in the bedroom and play with the invisible dog that Uncle Exidor gave you.
SUPMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I just can't believe it.
SUPMALE:Come on, Pablo.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:Pablo, come on.
LEADFEMALE:We're going to the bedroom now.
LEADMALE:Drop that.
LEADFEMALE:That thing's been dead for days.
LEADMALE:Drop it.
LEADFEMALE:Drop it.
SUPMALE:Arf, arf.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:You probably just think I'm overreacting, don't you? - Yes.
LEADFEMALE:- A silly Orkan venting his jealousy.
LEADMALE:- Hmm? - Mm-hm.
SUPMALE:It pretty well sums it up, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You're upsetting yourself over something I told you was over with ten years ago.
LEADFEMALE:I really think I deserve a little more of your trust than that.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I guess I have been kind of foolish.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, come to think of it, I don't even know what What's his name? Oh, Stevie.
SUPMALE:Stevie.
LEADMALE:Heh, heh.
OTHERMALE:So it's Stevie now? Oh, the pain, the anguish.
LEADMALE:The solitude.
LEADFEMALE:Now I know how the other two Supremes felt.
SUPMALE:Ain't no mountain high enough Ain't no river Mork, listen to me.
LEADFEMALE:The only reason there was ever a Steve in my life was because I hadn't met Mork yet.
SUPFEMALE:Do you understand? No.
SUPMALE:Okay, be that way.
LEADFEMALE:I really don't have time for this.
SUPMALE:I've gotta get to work.
SUPFEMALE:Bye, Mearth.
OTHERMALE:Mommy has to go to work.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you later.
LEADMALE:Daddy, Daddy, who won? Well, we both did, son.
LEADFEMALE:You see, we had a little problem there, but now everything is just tutti-frutti.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:- Hello.
OTHERMALE:- Flowers for Mindy McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you very much, and here's your tip.
LEADMALE:Never eat Mexican food and stand next to a flame.
OTHERMALE:Oh, what's in this? Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Isn't that neat? - You bought flowers for Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:- No, I didn't.
OTHERMALE:Heh.
OTHERMALE:- I'll carry these.
LEADMALE:- Let's see.
LEADMALE:No, I never bought any flowers for Mommy.
LEADMALE:Let's see here.
LEADMALE:"Mindy, it was wonderful seeing you last night.
LEADFEMALE:Let's not wait another ten years.
LEADMALE:Love, Stevie.
LEADFEMALE:" Who's Stevie? He's the lieutenant governor of Wyoming and your future stepfather.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that right? Well, Pablo, better saddle up.
SUPFEMALE:We're on our way to cattle country.
LEADMALE:Come on, Dad, blow.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mearth, you're such a comfort to me.
SUPMALE:Hope I get to at least see you on weekends and leap years.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you kidding? Mommy loves you, Daddy.
OTHERFEMALE:I know that, but the problem is that Mommy loved someone else before she loved me.
LEADFEMALE:That's very possible.
LEADFEMALE:But you must know now that she loves you more than anything in the world, Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:You're number one, you're the head honcho.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you're right.
SUPMALE:But what if you're wrong? Don't ask me.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't been able to cope with fractions yet.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna take these flowers and be sure that they stay alive.
SUPMALE:I guess I'll put them in the tub with Pablo.
LEADMALE:I don't think he'll mind after carrying that dead thing around.
SUPFEMALE:Pablo.
LEADMALE:Woof, woof, woof! I wonder if she would have loved me then.
SUPMALE:Well, I've got two choices.
SUPMALE:I can either stand here and talk to myself like a soap opera or go back in time and really find out.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
OTHERMALE:I'll do it.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't used these in a long time, but now's a very special occasion.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well Of course.
LEADFEMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:Liberace's lounge slippers.
SUPMALE:I want those shoes.
LEADFEMALE:I was an alien when I met her.
SUPFEMALE:I'll go back, I'll be an alien again.
LEADFEMALE:It should work the second time around.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Should work.
LEADFEMALE:Ready now.
OTHERFEMALE:There's no place like home.
SUPMALE:There's no place like severe pain in the ankles.
SUPMALE:No, wait.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go back in time.
LEADFEMALE:'71, here I come.
LEADMALE:'71, here I come.

OTHERMALE:Happy to be in America.
LEADMALE:My name is Vladimir lvanovich Orkoff.
SUPFEMALE:But you can call me Chuck.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Chuck, I don't care if you're Doctor Zhivago.
LEADMALE:Nobody gets in here without a student ID.
SUPFEMALE:Beat it before I'm forced to get physical with you.
LEADFEMALE:- What seems to be the problem here? - This foreign guy's trying to crash.
LEADMALE:I'm trying to keep this gym safe for democracy.
OTHERMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think there's a more reasonable way to deal with this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, Pops.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:McConnell.
SUPFEMALE:Do I know you from someplace? I come by the music store all the time looking for a copy of Brezhnev Sings Ray Charles.
SUPFEMALE:You know: Georgy, Georgy Look, Dickie, he's an exchange student.

LEADMALE:- Tsk.
SUPMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:If you ever come to Soviet Union, I can get you such beautiful women.
LEADMALE:You know, Soviet girls.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, especially since you're the only guy here without a date except for me.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Who is she? She is one foxy mammal.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I would walk ten miles in the snow just to stand in her garbage.
OTHERFEMALE:That's Mindy McConnell.
LEADMALE:You might as well forget it.
SUPMALE:I've been after her since the second grade.
SUPFEMALE:You'd think by now I'd at least have gotten a pity date.
LEADMALE:She's only got eyes for that nerd Steve.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't care what you say, I am going to marry her.
LEADFEMALE:Dream on.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, she's got a Jiffy Pop hairdo too.
SUPFEMALE:I may not be a poli-sci major, but I still think that history will prove that Nixon is a great president.
LEADFEMALE:I think Karl knows what he's talking about.
SUPMALE:He writes for his college paper.
SUPMALE:Really? Do they have a good Journalism Department at Columbia? Come on, Snooks.
OTHERFEMALE:How are you gonna be a reporter? In a newspaper, you can't dot your I's with little hearts.
LEADMALE:Give me a break, Stevie.
SUPFEMALE:Good evening.
SUPMALE:How are you? Permit me to introduce myself.
LEADMALE:I am foreign-exchange student Vladimir Ivanovich Orkoff.
OTHERFEMALE:But you can call me Lumpy.

LEADFEMALE:No gag, please.
SUPFEMALE:For one dance, I will give you actual autographed picture of Joseph Stalin.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, you don't have to do that.
LEADMALE:- Really? - You know Stalin? - Personably.
SUPMALE:- Some other time, okay, pal? - Sorry.
SUPMALE:Later.
LEADMALE:On the rebound.
LEADMALE:So tell me, Vladimir, what part of France are you from? I wish you'd just mellow out, Steven.
SUPMALE:The poor guy's from a foreign country.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know why you're being so uptight tonight anyway.
LEADFEMALE:I just thought he was kind of immature for a senior.
OTHERFEMALE:Steve.
OTHERFEMALE:Steve, some of the guys are drinking beer in the bathroom.
LEADMALE:If you came with me, they'd let me watch.
LEADFEMALE:Beer? Be right back, Snooks.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:So you're gonna leave me here and go get loaded.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, if it wasn't in the boys' room, I'd take you with me.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi.
LEADMALE:- Yo.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:So do you like being a foreign-exchange student? Oh, it's not bad.
LEADMALE:It's I come to Boulder to study Russian literature.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, that's kind of redundant, huh? Heh, heh.
LEADMALE:You know, my art teacher went to Russia once.
SUPFEMALE:She said Well, she said it was, like, really different than from here.
SUPMALE:Well, it's all right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let me enunciate to you.
LEADMALE:It is basically a You know in 1964, you had the Beatles invasion? Well, in 1968, we had the Czechoslovakian invasion.
LEADFEMALE:You got music, but we got land.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha.
OTHERMALE:Will you like to maybe, um, well, you know, boogie now? Shake your booties.
SUPMALE:- Oh, you want me to dance with you? - Oh, please.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I can't.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going steady.
LEADMALE:But I thought this was the land of the free and the home of the foot-long hot dog.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it is.
OTHERFEMALE:- All right, I'll dance with you.
LEADMALE:- Oh, whoa.
SUPFEMALE:I must do like you do.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I'm drowning.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, I love this country of yours, you know? - You do? - Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I guess we are pretty lucky here.
SUPMALE:You know, I was thinking about maybe being a journalist.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd really like to tell people what's going on in this country.
OTHERFEMALE:- Right off.
LEADMALE:- But I don't know.
LEADMALE:It's kind of a hard field for a woman to break into, and I don't know if I'd be any good at it anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you must, uh, go for it, you know? - Really? - I think that someday your family will be so proud of you.
LEADMALE:Thanks, that's really nice.
LEADMALE:How do you say "thank you" in your country? Oh, um Well, like this: Oh.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:That's nice.
SUPMALE:You know what else I was thinking about doing? I've had enough of you, borscht brain.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:I have my green card.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, please.
LEADMALE:I would not like to do Esther Williams - Steve, that's enough.
LEADFEMALE:- Attention! Attention! This is the moment we've all been waiting for.
LEADFEMALE:It gives me great pleasure right now to announce the names of this year's prom king and queen.
LEADFEMALE:I hope this isn't another failing notice.
SUPFEMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, act your age, not your IQ.
OTHERMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:And the winner is Katharine Hepburn! Just kidding.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, big surprise.
SUPFEMALE:Steve Sanders and Mindy McConnell! Oh, how dreamy! I knew it! I just knew it! Okay, make way! Make way! The king and queen are going to dance.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I hope you're happy.
SUPMALE:Yeah, we won, didn't we? - Is that all you care about? - They're taking our picture.
SUPFEMALE:Smile.
OTHERFEMALE:It's the biggest night of your life.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, it just might be, Steve, because this is our last date.
LEADMALE:- What? - I used to think you were a really nice guy, but I've changed my mind.
LEADMALE:Later.
SUPFEMALE:Lumpy, will you dance with me? Oh, you're asking me, a humble peasant? Whew.
SUPMALE:Ten years in two minutes flat.
OTHERFEMALE:The in-flight movie wasn't that bad either.
LEADMALE:They finally found a place to show Heaven's Gate.
LEADMALE:- Hi.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi.
SUPMALE:Mind I came back because I feel that we really haven't cleared the air about Steve.
LEADMALE:Aw.
LEADMALE:Come on, now, Mind, that's all in the past.
SUPFEMALE:You know, jealousy's just insecurity, and you've never ever given me anything to feel insecure about.
LEADMALE:I love you.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You know, sometimes I think I've waited my whole life for you.
LEADMALE:Thanks for showing up.
OTHERMALE:Well, thanks for waiting.
LEADMALE:I better go check on Mearth.
LEADMALE:Today we're gonna teach Pablo how to avoid hair balls.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I picked you up a little something.
LEADMALE:- Oh, that's nice.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:- A little surprise.
LEADFEMALE:- Mm-hm.
LEADMALE:No, don't cry, please.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hey, what's wrong with Mearth? - There's been a death in the family.
LEADMALE:- What? His spider died.
SUPMALE:What? Herman? Oh, poor baby.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess you're not in the mood for seeing the nice present your mommy and I got for you.
SUPMALE:What? Presents, Mearth.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, my gosh.
SUPMALE:- Look, a giant lollipop.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my gosh! That is a big sucker.
LEADMALE:Boy, I guess this is just about the best present I ever got.
SUPMALE:Or is it? Aw, Grandma.
OTHERMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPFEMALE:Whoo.
LEADFEMALE:Gosh, you know something, Grandma? And Mommy and Daddy? You see inside there's Mr.
SUPMALE:Silver.
SUPMALE:That's what I'm going to call him, Mr.
LEADMALE:Silver Helmet.
SUPMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mind, a minute ago he was crying, and now from zero to bliss in 60 seconds.
LEADFEMALE:Look at that.
OTHERMALE:Well, Mork, you see, with children, sometimes just a little present will do a world of good.
LEADMALE:- Oh, a little preschool Abscam.
SUPFEMALE:- Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth, don't do that in the house.
SUPMALE:You might break something.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Look at her go, son.
LEADFEMALE:A loop-de-loop.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute, Mayday, Mayday, there's a Chihuahua on the landing field.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, don't look, son.

SUPMALE:Don't cry.
LEADFEMALE:You still have your lollipop.
LEADMALE:I guess you're right.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh! But Herman, he's stuck to it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, son, look at the good side.
OTHERMALE:Now you got an all-day spider.
SUPMALE:He's a lot bigger than I remember him.
LEADFEMALE:Here, Mearth, hand Mommy your coat.
OTHERMALE:Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:The tooth fairy has been keeping up with inflation.
OTHERMALE:Gee, I wonder who could be behind all this.
LEADFEMALE:Surprise! No, not really.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, son, look.
LEADMALE:All this is for you.
SUPMALE:You're never gonna be sad or cry again.
OTHERMALE:No, never.
OTHERFEMALE:Even that big TV? Yes, you'll finally see all the lines on Dick Clark's face.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, why does our place look like Bob Barker's den? I don't know, Mind.
LEADMALE:Maybe Bob has the same couch.
LEADMALE:Ride on this great big green grasshopper.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't it marvelous, Mind? I feel just like UNICEF.
SUPMALE:Mork, these things have got to go back.
LEADFEMALE:This is no way to raise a child.
LEADFEMALE:You'll spoil him with all these gifts.
SUPFEMALE:I am still making the same salary for three as when there were just two of us.
LEADMALE:And we have to dip into our emergency savings account just to feed him.
OTHERFEMALE:He eats more than Trigger.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, come on, now I'm sorry, Mork, but this stuff goes back.
OTHERFEMALE:Not the harp, though, Mind.
SUPMALE:Not the harp.
LEADMALE:Mind, you don't understand, like He Mearth is a musical prodigy.

OTHERMALE:Yes, Mork, that was cute.
LEADFEMALE:You tell him it goes back.
SUPMALE:I want him to have everything I've never had and still don't.
OTHERMALE:It's no way to raise a child.
LEADMALE:Don't you see? If you give him everything now, he'll have nothing to look forward to later.
SUPFEMALE:- You've gotta tell him.
LEADMALE:- Oh, it's gonna be so hard.
LEADFEMALE:- It'll break his little heart.
OTHERMALE:- Mm-hm.
LEADFEMALE:You tell him.

SUPFEMALE:Mind, after two of those, this is gonna be an emotional lay-up, you know what I'm saying? Mearth, the real truth is that we can't afford all these little goodies, and they've gotta all go back.

SUPFEMALE:I read you.
LEADFEMALE:You just You and Mom don't love me anymore.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, no, no, no.
LEADMALE:- I can handle it.
SUPFEMALE:I can handle it.

LEADFEMALE:I lost a man in an airplane.
SUPMALE:The dog ate him.
LEADFEMALE:Surely I can handle you.
LEADFEMALE:- You just don't love me anymore.
LEADFEMALE:- No, Mearth.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:Don't start.
SUPFEMALE:No, it's okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'll find, you know I'll find something to do upstairs in my room.
OTHERFEMALE:Like maybe, you know, playing with the shadows on the ceiling.
LEADFEMALE:Well, are you happy now, Mind? Oh, Mork, he'll get over it.
LEADFEMALE:As painful as it seems now, it was all for the best.
SUPMALE:You don't wanna spoil him like that.
LEADFEMALE:You're right, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:He wouldn't have looked good in this fur coat anyway.
OTHERMALE:What size is that? Answer the door already.
LEADFEMALE:Never mind.
LEADMALE:I'll get it myself.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you're late.
SUPMALE:I'm having a barbecue.
SUPFEMALE:I just dropped over to borrow a spatula and a grill, some briquettes, hamburgers, buns, matches and a volleyball net.
SUPMALE:How come you're not there? Well, I wasn't invited.
OTHERFEMALE:Just as well.
LEADMALE:This is for my musical-comedy workshop only.
LEADFEMALE:Exidor, you've gotta help me.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna shower my son with gifts, and Mindy says we can't afford it.
LEADMALE:Who's right? Mork, I'd like to help you, but this is the wrong time.
SUPFEMALE:I got 40 starving people in my backyard singing "Brigadoon.
LEADMALE:" You need money, go find work.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I've tried to find a job, but I have no skills.
SUPMALE:Well, that leaves real estate.
LEADFEMALE:Please, I have some pride.
LEADMALE:Mork, I'd like to help What? There's always one idiot who comes to a barbecue who doesn't eat meat.
SUPMALE:Now, regarding this problem with your son Exidor, either you've had a revelation, or someone just kicked a field goal.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, I've just had a vision of incredible clarity.
LEADFEMALE:It was just like having the cable.
SUPFEMALE:I now know how you can take care of all your family's financial needs.
LEADMALE:Mork, money is the key to happiness.
LEADFEMALE:And the only way to make money is to spend money.
LEADMALE:Mork, you've got to make that once-in-a-lifetime investment that will take care of all your family's financial needs.
LEADMALE:Well, Exidor, all we have is $900 and my stock in Air Libya.
LEADMALE:Perfect.
LEADMALE:This will be bigger than Polaroid, Genentech and bootleg tapes rolled into one.
SUPMALE:What's the one thing the world needs more of? Nixon impersonators.
LEADMALE:I'm talking about bigger, grander, something the world keeps crying for more of.
SUPFEMALE:- What? - Me! Guillermo, keep an eye on the store.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going in the back for more inspected-by-number-seven tags.
LEADFEMALE:Who would have thought Mickey Mantle would end up this way? Wow.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:This place is wonderful, just like what the Marquis de Sade would've done if he'd gone into retail.
LEADMALE:Yeah, this is a great location, Mork.
SUPMALE:You walk through an animal hospital, knock twice, ask for a man named Juanita, then slide down a pole.
LEADMALE:How many times you see a hamster neutered on your way into Macy's? Oh, isn't this to die over? I see 20 things I already wanna get.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I don't I don't see 20 things I can identify.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Mind, you'd look smashing in something like this.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Anthony Quinn wouldn't look smashing in something like that.
SUPMALE:I think Exidor is onto something hot here, Mind.
LEADMALE:I think he's got a great new concept.
OTHERMALE:You've heard of Old Amos? Well, how about these? Exidoreos.
LEADMALE:Chocolate, cheese and meat.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Mork, I admire Exidor's initiative, but if somebody told me he was gonna open a store, this is exactly what I'd expect.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's just It's just ridiculous.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, you call this ridiculous? Yeah, I'd say that just about defines the word.
SUPMALE:Mindy, come on, you can't be so negative.
LEADMALE:You've gotta find something positive about this whole experience.
LEADMALE:Well, the color combination on this cookie is excellent.
LEADMALE:Oh, you see? That's wonderful.
SUPMALE:Because you know what? You, Exidor and me, we're all partners.
SUPMALE:- What? - In the tradition of J.
OTHERFEMALE:Pierpont Morgan, J.
SUPMALE:Paul Getty, and Jay and the Americans, I have invested our $900 in the Exidor Boutique.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't hit me, don't hit me.
SUPFEMALE:I have corrective shoes on.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you may have seen me angry before, but now I'm talking real angry.
LEADMALE:I'm talking black poet, you know what I mean? Yeah, Mind, l Boy, some people don't know how to handle sudden wealth.
SUPMALE:I mean, Kenny Rogers wouldn't behave this way.
SUPMALE:Come on, Mind, you should be happy that I made a shrewd investment.
LEADFEMALE:You call giving all our money to Exidor shrewd? Why didn't you just flush it instead? Unless you've got an inside tip, Mind, I think that's pretty risky.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
OTHERMALE:You are head of a household now.
LEADFEMALE:That means you have responsibilities.
LEADFEMALE:Not only to yourself, but to me and especially toward your son.
SUPMALE:And that means you can't take risks with our future.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not taking a risk.
LEADFEMALE:Taking a risk is slicing a bagel without turning it.
SUPMALE:Mork, you can't make an investment unless you can afford to lose.
SUPFEMALE:And we can't, and now we're gonna lose everything.
SUPFEMALE:Well, come on, now, Mind, don't panic.
SUPMALE:Exidor knows what he's doing.
LEADMALE:What do you mean the mannequins want a coffee break? They just had one ten minutes ago, and all they did was dribble.
LEADMALE:Partner! Glad to see you brought the little woman.
LEADMALE:We want our money back now, and don't call me "the little woman.
SUPMALE:" What she's trying to say is, Exidor, we're We've had a change of heart, like Renée Richards wanted to change dressing rooms.
LEADMALE:I've only been open two hours.
SUPFEMALE:Even Evita didn't pay off its backers that fast.
SUPFEMALE:We want our money back.
LEADFEMALE:Look, business is a little slow.
OTHERFEMALE:But we're gonna have our two-for-one sale.
SUPMALE:Buy two, get one.
LEADMALE:Who can resist that? That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
SUPMALE:Listen, perky.
LEADMALE:Are you insinuating I'm some kind of crackpot? Well, that's what they said about David Rockefeller.
LEADMALE:Nobody ever said that about David Rockefeller.
LEADFEMALE:I did.
LEADMALE:Pepe.
OTHERMALE:Pepe, you call yourself a tailor? Just lengthen the sleeve.
OTHERMALE:Don't clip his nails.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:- That's it, our money is gone.
SUPMALE:- No, no, come on, now, I know.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, I was just trying to increase our wealth.
LEADFEMALE:I know it's a risk.
SUPMALE:It's a dumb thing.
SUPFEMALE:Even dumber when I bought the soundtrack to Beatlemania, but it was an incredible simulation.
SUPFEMALE:- Mork.
SUPMALE:- Mind? Mork, I'll grant you one thing.
LEADMALE:Your heart is in the right place, but sometimes your head is in - Oh, never mind.
LEADMALE:I'm going home.
LEADMALE:- Mindy, listen.
SUPFEMALE:This is America.
SUPFEMALE:You can come from another country with a name like: And leave with a name like Chuck.
LEADMALE:Easy.
SUPFEMALE:There's gotta be a way out of here.
SUPMALE:Mind, come on.
SUPMALE:He can sell anything here.
LEADMALE:If they can sell designer jeans and pet rocks, we gotta be able to sell this stuff.
SUPMALE:There's gotta be something we can do to make people want this.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute! What are you watching? Good afternoon.
LEADMALE:I'm Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, and I'll be your guide on this incredible journey through the totally outrageous world of Exidor, where style and elegance meet for a very brief moment.
LEADMALE:Won't you join us for this incredible fashion smorgasbord? And let's bring out our first model.
LEADMALE:Sissy? In the evening, Exidor comes alive, and so does Sissy in this smashing formal ensemble.
LEADMALE:Note the dual-purpose jacket, which converts into a fashionable pup tent.
SUPFEMALE:Too campy? Ah.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Sissy.
LEADMALE:And now, what is this? The Exidor evening gown.
SUPFEMALE:Ideal for dining in elegance or with Pancho Gonzales.
SUPMALE:Because it converts into tennis, Exidor? Yes, I bet she's got some good strokes, huh, fellas? That's game, set and match.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Sissy.
SUPMALE:I think I'd like one of those myself.
OTHERMALE:And now, what could be more Exidorian than Exidor himself, modelling the executive Exidor? Yes, for the man on the go who can't say no and, well, who drives well in the snow.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, for the true executive, it says, "One good audit puts me in jail for life.
LEADFEMALE:" Now, for you urbane urban cowboys, it's go west, young Exidor! Whether you're on the fringe or just living on welfare, that's right, Hi-yo Silver, giddy-up, move it, horsey.

LEADFEMALE:It's something that will really Tell me something, Daddy.
LEADMALE:Do you think there'll be other children to play with in debtor's prison? Thirty-five for gas.
LEADMALE:All right, what next? Forty-two dollars for telephone? Mearth has Daddy been calling Dial-A-Joke again? - Mearth? - I'm no fink.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, family, family, I have wonderful, wonderful news.
LEADFEMALE:I sold my Air Libya stock, and look, we got $2.
LEADMALE:We can live on this for about an hour.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mearth Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh Mind, you tell him the truth.
LEADMALE:I can't look in those innocent brown eyes, especially with those crow's feet.
OTHERFEMALE:Mearth, see, Daddy did a really dumb thing.
SUPMALE:It's not that bad, Mind.
SUPMALE:Mearth, Daddy's upset because he made a little mistake.
SUPMALE:Saying it's a little mistake is like saying Lizzie Borden was a little nuisance with an ax.
SUPFEMALE:Mearth, l I've I lost all of our money.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I feel like a snail trail without the glitter.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, don't be so hard on yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody can make a mistake.
SUPFEMALE:And you happened to make a big one.
LEADMALE:But we'll get by, I think.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you can forget about the boutique.
LEADFEMALE:I dumped it.
LEADMALE:And it's a good thing.
LEADMALE:Otherwise you'd be rich too.
SUPFEMALE:- Rich? - Rich? It's making money? - The place has gone through the roof.
LEADFEMALE:- Why? I suppose you're wondering why.
SUPMALE:Teenagers.
LEADFEMALE:They'll buy anything their parents hate.
LEADFEMALE:Now everywhere I go, everybody's wearing Exidor outfits.
SUPMALE:Infants, teenagers, Lee Radziwill.
LEADMALE:Exidor, you're a mogul now.
LEADMALE:I'm miserable.
LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to appeal to the intellectual fringe.
LEADFEMALE:Money doesn't make you happy.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, Ex, it sure perked up Melvin Dummar for a while.
OTHERFEMALE:Here, perky, here's your investment plus profit.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't Monopoly money.
SUPFEMALE:This is real money.
SUPFEMALE:Of course.
SUPFEMALE:I sold out.
LEADMALE:I'm just designing now.
LEADMALE:The person that bought it is a little strange, but business breeds strange bedfellows.
SUPMALE:- Grandma! - Oh, there you are, Exidor.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry I'm late, but it was really brutal getting up that pole.
LEADMALE:Grandma, why? Wise up, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:A buck's a buck.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, when you dress like that, you remind me of my own grandmother.
OTHERFEMALE:She was a strange woman, heavy into voodoo.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, look.
OTHERFEMALE:This is marvelous.
LEADFEMALE:At last, we can buy Mearth a little something.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe a DeLorean car.
LEADMALE:Mommy, I don't want you to worry anymore.
LEADFEMALE:What you gave me is that wonderful set of toys that's here.
LEADMALE:Imagination.
LEADMALE:Look, for instance: Okay, give me an O.
LEADMALE:Give me a K.
OTHERFEMALE:Give me an L.
LEADMALE:I should never have sat on the Texas side.
OTHERMALE:I tell you, there's trouble.
SUPFEMALE:What is it you said, sir? "Let the games begin"? Oh, neat.
OTHERFEMALE:They should never have held the Olympics in Australia.
OTHERMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Your Tub of Lardness.
LEADFEMALE:Na-no, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Sir.
LEADFEMALE:So how's that godson of mine? Oh, sir, he's in the pink.
LEADMALE:And me? I'm a wreck.
LEADMALE:I didn't realize being a parent was so difficult.
LEADFEMALE:I thought the only difficult part of being a parent was going into labor.
LEADMALE:Well, sir, that's the short view.
OTHERMALE:But in the long view, children test you every day, and you can't slide through the essay questions.
SUPFEMALE:Why not send the child to obedience school? That'd be nice, sir, if you wanna teach a child to heel or roll over.
LEADFEMALE:That's not teaching about life.
SUPMALE:You have to give them love, understanding, companionship, and, boy, am I lucky I have got Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:- Mork.
SUPMALE:- Sir? I never realized raising a child involved so much responsibility.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sir, being a parent is always on-the-job training.
OTHERFEMALE:By the time you learn the trade, you're out of the business.
LEADMALE:But if you do things correctly, you'll always be connected with the firm.
OTHERFEMALE:Till next week, sir, na-no, na-no.
SUPMALE:Na-no, na-no.
LEADFEMALE:All right, you've seen what we did to him.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, tell me where the others are hiding.
LEADFEMALE:Somehow that makes me so excited.
OTHERMALE:Hold on.
OTHERFEMALE:There we go.
OTHERFEMALE:And the crowning touch.
LEADFEMALE:Finished at last.
LEADFEMALE:More than one way to make a child eat healthy food.
SUPMALE:Today a vegetable snowman, tomorrow a liver collie.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mearth, Mearth, look what Daddy made especially for you.
SUPMALE:Yes! Oh, sweetheart, stop crying, it's all right.
LEADMALE:No, it isn't all right.
SUPFEMALE:It isn't.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have any friends.
SUPFEMALE:None at all.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody will play with me.
OTHERFEMALE:I feel just like George Steinbrenner.
SUPFEMALE:Son, wait! Wait, you haven't even seen what happens when I add the gravy.
LEADFEMALE:Poor little guy.
LEADFEMALE:He was having such a good time in the park on the sled hill - and then he tried to get on toboggan - Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:You went to the sled hill and you didn't take me? Will you let me finish please? He tried to get on the toboggan, and when he did, the parents pulled all their kids off.
LEADMALE:They thought he was a man.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, you should've seen the look on his face.
LEADFEMALE:He's starting to realize he's different.
LEADMALE:You're right, Mind.
SUPMALE:I guess he doesn't buy our story about being just big-boned, huh? Well, it's time to tell him that he's half-Orkan - and half an Earthling.
LEADMALE:- Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:He still might be too young to accept it, Mork.
SUPMALE:Let's just wait till he's older or younger.
LEADFEMALE:Or Whatever.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on now, Mind, he can accept it.
LEADFEMALE:He's half a superior being.
LEADFEMALE:I mean look at me, I'm an alien and I have made a remarkable adjustment.
SUPFEMALE:You see Do I smell salad burning? Probably.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I forgot to baste it.
LEADFEMALE:It's not a pretty picture, but, you know, it's homemade.
SUPMALE:I should never cook on medication.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:Let's just try to protect him for a while longer.
LEADFEMALE:He's just a child.
LEADMALE:Daddy, could I borrow one of your new razor blades? The reason I ask is mine are all dull from trying to sharpen my crayons.
LEADMALE:Oh, surely, son.
LEADFEMALE:See, I wanna get this real clean, so that I can play with the kids, or they in turn will play with me.
SUPFEMALE:You know, solitaire is a game, but it's not a way of life.
LEADFEMALE:- Maybe now is the time to tell him.
LEADFEMALE:- You're right, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:This is a very delicate situation.
LEADFEMALE:We have to choose the words very carefully.
LEADMALE:What's that? Well, the title is Rejection Descending a Staircase.
LEADMALE:It's my blue period.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, don't feel that way, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:You have Mommy and Daddy.
LEADMALE:Not just Mommy and Daddy, it's Mommy and Daddy and Señor Goodnews.
SUPMALE:Señor Goodnews has something he wants to tell you, doesn't he, Daddy? He sure does, Mind.
LEADMALE:What about that, Señor Goodnews? Why should I? He's your child.
OTHERMALE:Take responsibility.
LEADFEMALE:Oh-ho-ho.
LEADFEMALE:- One of you tell him.
SUPMALE:- All right.
SUPFEMALE:Tell you what, let's take a vote.
LEADFEMALE:What do you vote for? I vote for the shiksa queen.
LEADMALE:Me too.
SUPFEMALE:It's unanimous.
LEADMALE:Are you chickening out? You got it, sweet shorts.
SUPMALE:Mearth, sweetheart, have you ever noticed that you aren't exactly like all the other kids? Of course.
LEADFEMALE:For instance, the other day in the market, I was the only kid that couldn't get in the wire basket.
SUPFEMALE:Mearth, sweetheart, the reason is, you see The reason is, son, me.
LEADFEMALE:You see, I'm not exactly a hometown boy.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not even in the ballpark, as they say.
LEADMALE:I'm from another planet.
LEADFEMALE:No! Stop that, Daddy.
SUPMALE:Stop it, you mustn't You mustn't kid around like that with me, especially when I'm your only child.
LEADFEMALE:Sweetheart, Daddy isn't kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe Mommy can explain it better.
SUPMALE:Look over here, Mearth.
SUPFEMALE:See, Mommy's using visual aids.
LEADFEMALE:She's telling the story really well.
LEADMALE:That's the letter O.
OTHERFEMALE:This is the planet Earth.
SUPMALE:You were born here and so was I.
SUPMALE:And way over here, millions and millions of miles away, - is the planet Ork.
LEADMALE:- Yes, you see.
LEADFEMALE:Ork, the "Show Me" planet.
OTHERFEMALE:I flew all the way from Ork back here to Earth.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't like the tone of this conversation.
OTHERFEMALE:Son, you see, I was sent here to observe.
SUPFEMALE:- Si? - Yes, si, observe.
LEADFEMALE:And I met your mother and she couldn't keep her hands off me, and the rest is history.
SUPMALE:And that means that you're half-Orkan and half-Earthling.
LEADMALE:Is that why I'm different from the rest of the kids? Well, just for a little while.
SUPFEMALE:But pretty soon you'll look like them because you see, the Orkan part of you is aging backwards so you're getting smaller.
LEADMALE:And the older you get, the younger you'll look, just like Lena Horne.
SUPMALE:See how unique you are, sweetheart? I'm not unique.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a freak.
LEADMALE:Kids call me Butchie, the dog-faced boy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, sweetheart, don't you ever think that.
LEADFEMALE:You know, on Ork, all the kids look just like you.
OTHERMALE:And someday Daddy's gonna take us there.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why can't he take us there now? Well, we can't go there now, sweetheart, because you live here with us and Grandma and Grandpa.
LEADFEMALE:And me with these little, stupid balls on my head.
OTHERFEMALE:Why me? Why do I have to be different? Well, being different isn't bad.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on now, son, look.
SUPFEMALE:Look at the good side.
OTHERMALE:You'll never have to do jury duty, you'll never have a vaccination mark.
SUPMALE:And you can do wonderful neato things like this.
SUPFEMALE:Watch.
LEADMALE:- No, no.
LEADMALE:Stop it.
LEADFEMALE:Stop it.
OTHERMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:- Mork, you're scaring him.
SUPFEMALE:Mearth, sweetheart, I know it's hard for you to understand now, but later you'll see that you're very unique and there's no one else like you in the whole universe.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:We love you, little half-and-half pint.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:This has all gotten terribly heavy for me all of a sudden.
LEADMALE:I have to be alone, that's all.
SUPFEMALE:I have to be alone.
LEADMALE:Okay, well, we'll be downstairs if you need us, all right? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Poor Mearth.
LEADMALE:Probably harder for him to understand than an episode of Hill Street Blues.
LEADFEMALE:Don't.
SUPMALE:Mind, I love it when you wear just the hat.
LEADMALE:Animal.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Mearth, breakfast time! Come and get it, come on now.
SUPMALE:- Mind! Mind, he's not there.
OTHERMALE:- What? What? He's gone.
LEADMALE:This was on his bed.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, I knew we shouldn't tell him he's an alien.
LEADFEMALE:- Mearth's run away.
LEADMALE:- Let's be calm now.
LEADMALE:I'll go out and look for him and you stay here in case he comes back.
SUPMALE:- How you gonna know where to look? - Be brave, little "pooter.
LEADMALE:" We Orkans have an incredible way of communicating with each other.
LEADMALE:Don't you worry about a thing.
SUPFEMALE:Mearth! Mearth! Where the hell are you? No one's ever gonna be able to fill my kid's shoes.
SUPFEMALE:If they had these on the Titanic, four more people would have lived.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, we've looked everywhere.
LEADMALE:We just can't find him.
LEADMALE:- We're gonna have to call the police.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, no way, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:If they find out he's our child, they'll lock us up.
LEADMALE:And I'm not that eager to see a Johnny Cash concert.
SUPMALE:Did you find him? - Yes and no.
LEADFEMALE:- What do you mean? The airport, I saw him at the airport.
LEADFEMALE:If he wandered in the coffee shop, he's probably still waiting for service.
LEADFEMALE:- Come on, Mind, let's go.
LEADMALE:- No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:He's with those cult people in the black robes.
SUPFEMALE:The Utopians? Yes, they wouldn't let me speak to him.
LEADFEMALE:A cop told me Mearth was a grown man and could do whatever he wanted to.
OTHERMALE:Next thing I knew, they were driving him away in a van.
LEADMALE:Mind, come on, let's put the pedal to the metal, hop in the Jeep and go find Mearth.
LEADMALE:Mork, it's not gonna be that easy.
SUPMALE:Remember when I did that piece on the Utopians? Yes, and they'll brainwash people until they'll give up everything.
LEADFEMALE:Even their identities.
SUPMALE:Oh, sounds like a cult we had on Ork called the Rosorryians.
SUPMALE:They try, but they can't get the stains out of your dry cleaning.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if we can't call the police, what are we gonna do? We're gonna take action because nothing's gonna stop me from finding my child, except for one thing, I don't know where he is.
SUPMALE:The Utopians have a retreat up in the mountains not too far from here.
LEADMALE:But it's protected like a fortress with barbed wire and guard dogs.
SUPMALE:Sounds like it'd be easier to get James Watt into the Sierra Club.
SUPFEMALE:The only thing we can do is to try and break him out ourselves.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, that sounds dangerous and I'm gonna go with you.
LEADMALE:No, Dad, you'd really be better if you'd stay here by the phone.
SUPMALE:He might call.
SUPFEMALE:And if we're not back by midnight, turn off the Crock-Pot.
LEADMALE:All right, Mind, haul tush, haul tush.
OTHERFEMALE:Utopians, welcome our new brother.
LEADFEMALE:Baba Swell has taken his first steps to a life of eternal devotion, which reminds me, our love is strong, but candle sales, they're slipping.
LEADFEMALE:Now I want everyone to go their separate ways and meditate on the color green.
LEADMALE:You know something, Baba Hope, you talk pretty.
SUPFEMALE:Now, Baba Swell, it is time for you to rid yourself of all your worldy possessions.
LEADFEMALE:Jewelry, money, second-trust deeds? I really don't have any of those things, but I have Bonzo.
LEADMALE:He's thin.
SUPMALE:That's because I stepped on him about a half a dozen times.
LEADFEMALE:- Is that all? - Not quite.
OTHERMALE:I have a half a yo-yo.
LEADMALE:It's a yo.
OTHERFEMALE:Never mind.
LEADMALE:You go, continue training with your love broom.
LEADFEMALE:Eventually you'll get your full heart and graduate to busboy on steak night.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe I caught your name.
SUPFEMALE:My name is Baba Gentle.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it.
LEADFEMALE:Baba Gentle.
SUPMALE:Bye-bye, Bonzo.
SUPMALE:Bye-bye, yo.
LEADFEMALE:Some outsider tried to interfere with us taking him at the airport.
LEADFEMALE:To avoid any trouble, we're shipping him out tonight to our Oregon retreat.
LEADMALE:We have a worker convert and we're keeping him.
LEADMALE:Mork, come on.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in.
LEADMALE:I can't, Mind, I've got my hem caught in a sprinkler head.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! Why couldn't we have gotten those designer robes with the slit up the side? Shh! Let's just find Mearth and get out of here.
LEADMALE:You check up the stairs and I'll look through here.
LEADMALE:Mind, Mind.
SUPMALE:I've got a better idea.
SUPFEMALE:You check down here and I'll hide under your robe.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just as scared as you are, but we gotta think about Mearth.
LEADMALE:- Right.
LEADFEMALE:Who? - Somebody's coming.
LEADFEMALE:Shh.
LEADFEMALE:So that's what happened to our old anchorman.
LEADFEMALE:Let's get these robes back or there's gonna be one judge looking real casual.
SUPFEMALE:You sweep up in here.
LEADMALE:I will go feed the love attack dogs.
SUPFEMALE:Goody, goody, Baba Gentle.
LEADMALE:And say hello to Baba Bow-wow for me, will you? Mearth, don't scream, it's us.
LEADFEMALE:Mommy and Daddy, I'm not Mearth anymore.
LEADMALE:No, I'm Baba Swell.
LEADMALE:Everybody here loves me.
LEADMALE:I went out to the airport, you see, to try to get some flights to Ork.
LEADMALE:There were no flights.
LEADFEMALE:Who came along but the Babas to save me.
LEADFEMALE:They were good to me.
SUPFEMALE:This place is like Utopia, you understand, except the food.
LEADMALE:Ugh.
LEADFEMALE:All right, sweetheart, Mommy knows all about this place and it's not what you think.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, we're taking you home.
SUPFEMALE:I can't, I can't.
SUPFEMALE:I can't go.
OTHERMALE:I can't.
OTHERMALE:You see, I'm Baba's love child.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, Mork.
LEADMALE:They've gotten to him.
LEADFEMALE:What will we do? It's all right, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I can deprogramme him.
SUPMALE:So Baba Love loves you, huh? Well, where was Baba Love when you had that cold, huh? Hmm? Did Baba Love take you to the park and teach you how to eat string cheese and, enh, like that? - No.
LEADMALE:- Shh.
SUPMALE:Come on, it's time to go now.
SUPFEMALE:I can't.
OTHERFEMALE:I want you meet my friends.
SUPMALE:Wait, wait, I want you to meet my friends.
LEADFEMALE:- No, we can't.
OTHERMALE:- Mearth, Mearth! - What's going on here? - Anybody order a Zen pizza? He was trying to take me home and I just Outsiders.
LEADMALE:Seize them! Easy, easy, please, be gentle with them, be gentle.
OTHERMALE:- Let go! - Ow! Is this the way you treat emissaries of Baba Love? If you're emissaries, why are your robes different from ours? Well, these are our away uniforms.
SUPFEMALE:This is an outrage! We bring you a special message from Baba Love.
SUPMALE:Yes, yes, ditto.
SUPMALE:Children, perhaps this is the dental plan we've all been chanting for.
OTHERFEMALE:- What is it? - What is it? Yes.
LEADMALE:Tell them what it is, Baba Loo.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, thank you, Baba Pooter.
LEADFEMALE:Baba Love sends his love and so does his brother Bubba, who plays for the Green Bay Packers.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Baba Love not only sends his love because Baba Love is love.
LEADFEMALE:Score now, love-love.
SUPFEMALE:I want to talk about love just for a moment.
LEADMALE:We know that love is a wonderful thing.
LEADMALE:It is a powerful thing.
LEADFEMALE:And sometimes it is misspelled by girls dancing at Grateful Dead concerts, going "Love, look it love.
SUPMALE:" We know We know that this can be a meaningful experience.
LEADFEMALE:But love is no substitute for recreation.
LEADFEMALE:What Baba Love wants to plan for the 80s is a new concept: Play! Yes, let's put the fun back in fundamentalism.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I'm saying? Because now, we're going to have the first annual Baba Love Scavenger Hunt! They're lying! Utopians don't go on scavenger hunts.
LEADMALE:You dare doubt the word of Baba Love? Oh, make two lines now.
SUPFEMALE:Let's put together a little human car wash.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, ladies, there we are.
LEADMALE:We must decide what we are going to look for on our scavenger hunt.
LEADMALE:Okay? Here's a list of things we'll all be looking for.
SUPFEMALE:Number one, one burning or badly-charred bush.
LEADMALE:One Also, one partially hidden truth, some new or used karma, anything else you can find, one copy of The Prophet autographed by Shaun Cassidy, uh, one pair of Naugahyde women's panties.
LEADFEMALE:Now, first couple back wins a dinner for two at Baba Love's House of Prayer and Ribs.
SUPMALE:So good luck, happy hunting and be here now, if not, get there later.
LEADMALE:Don't move! Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:You're really generating some negative energy here.
SUPMALE:I think what you need is a sign from Baba Love.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! Heh.
OTHERMALE:You got it.
LEADMALE:All you Baba's, A through M, follow me.
LEADFEMALE:The rest are on your own.
OTHERFEMALE:- Wait a minute, Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:- I'm going on a scavenger hunt.
LEADMALE:Bup-bup-bup.
SUPFEMALE:Mearth, we just wanna talk to you for a minute.
OTHERMALE:But I wanna catch up with them.
SUPFEMALE:I don't wanna be left behind.
SUPFEMALE:Mearth, Mearth, why did you run away? Well, because I was an alien.
LEADFEMALE:The kids wouldn't play with me and I finally I finally found a place where everybody was the same.
OTHERFEMALE:So you wanna be just like everybody else, huh? Well, Mearth, that's an easy thing to do.
OTHERFEMALE:That's very safe.
SUPMALE:But being different, well, that takes a lot of courage.
SUPFEMALE:All right, you can stay here and never have to think, or make a decision for yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Or you can go out and go to the real world and have joyous confrontations with hypocrisy, violence, nuclear holocaust, and over-bearing sales people.
SUPMALE:Yes, Daddy's right.
LEADMALE:There are a lot of bad things, but mostly there's good in the world.
LEADMALE:Oh, please come home, Mearth.
SUPFEMALE:No one could ever love you as much as us.
LEADMALE:We love you for who you are.
LEADMALE:- That's right.
LEADFEMALE:- Yes, but who am I? You're Mearth McConnell, our son.
SUPMALE:You want me to come home? For sure? - Yes.
SUPFEMALE:- Okay, can I keep the robe? - Yes.
SUPMALE:- Can I go on the scavenger hunt? - No.
LEADMALE:- No.
SUPFEMALE:Just testing.
SUPFEMALE:Bye-bye, broom.
LEADMALE:Boy, it's sure good to be back in my little warm egg again.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:And remember, if you ever have problems, you can come to us.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to run away.
LEADMALE:We're your family.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Mommy.
LEADMALE:Good night, son.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:- Go to sleep.
SUPFEMALE:- I will.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, it's so nice to have him back.
OTHERFEMALE:And it's great to be a family again.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mind, it's so nice now that he knows he's an alien too.
LEADMALE:Think of all the wonderful things I can teach him.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, teach him to sit on his face, drink with his finger, the old Orkan songs.
LEADFEMALE:Mommy hates to be a killjoy, but it's too late for Orkan stereo.
LEADMALE:Good night, Mearth.
SUPMALE:Big kiss.
LEADMALE:Why'd you cut us off, Mind? There was a part for you in the musical.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.
OTHERMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in, O Pudgy Potentate.
SUPMALE:Mork, is that who I think it is? Oh, yes, sir, it's the universe's one and only Mearth McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:Sir, it's been a very difficult week for Mearth because Mindy and I had to try and explain the truth about his heritage.
SUPFEMALE:He must have been devastated to find out he was half-Earthling.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, sir, au contraire, it's the other way around, you see.
LEADMALE:Finally he learned to accept his birthright and his heritage and the fact he can't order off the children's menu.
LEADMALE:- Very commendable, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Thank you, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Now, let me say na-no to the little fellow.
SUPMALE:Oh, certainement, sir.
LEADMALE:Mearth, come down here and say hello to your godfather, the big O.
LEADMALE:Na-no, sir.
OTHERMALE:It's an honor to meet you, sir.
LEADMALE:Na-no, Mearth.
LEADMALE:I see you make up in manners what your father lacks.
LEADFEMALE:You better believe it, Fatso.
SUPMALE:What? Pardon me, sir.
LEADMALE:It's nap time.
LEADMALE:We'd better be running along.
SUPFEMALE:Until next week, Thunder Thighs, Mork and Mearth signing off.
LEADMALE:Na-no.
SUPFEMALE:Na-no.
SUPMALE:- Fatso? - I called that guy 
SUPFEMALE:Na-no, na-no.
SUPMALE:- What is this stuff? - We've got a surprise for you.
LEADMALE:Chinese food! This looks like boiled grass.
LEADFEMALE:Look.
OTHERMALE:Ooh.
OTHERFEMALE:- Pass it over.
LEADFEMALE:- Careful, Mearth.
SUPMALE:Oh, dandruff.
LEADMALE:- Oh, I love this so.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, my.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, oh, oh.
LEADFEMALE:Fish net.
LEADFEMALE:Whale skin, whale skin.
LEADMALE:- Hold on now, what's this? - It's just what it is.
LEADMALE:- It's just orange, eat it.
LEADMALE:- Orange.
LEADMALE:It's sweet.
LEADMALE:I'm hypoglycemic.
LEADFEMALE:- Gran-pop, let me ask you something.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hm.
SUPFEMALE:Do they have American carry-outs in China? - Uh, no, not yet.
SUPFEMALE:- No, but every religious holiday, all the Chinese people go downtown for Jewish food.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm a very inquisitive child.
LEADMALE:You probably noticed that.
LEADFEMALE:And you know something? I believe I'm truly ready for school.
OTHERFEMALE:All the other children are going to school.
LEADFEMALE:Why aren't I going to school? Son, your mother and I can teach you everything you need to know at home.
LEADMALE:I mean, Abraham Lincoln studied at home.
LEADMALE:- Who's he? - Mind? Well, Mearth, Abraham Lincoln was our 16th president.
LEADFEMALE:I just feel weird.
LEADFEMALE:I just feel different, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:I should be going to school like the rest of the children, that's all.
LEADMALE:I should be going to school.
LEADMALE:Son, you don't need to go to school.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, since Jeopardy's been canceled, what do you need to know? I mean, you can always get a job on Family Feud.
SUPFEMALE:Show me mayonnaise.
LEADFEMALE:Sweetheart, an education is very important.
LEADMALE:And we're gonna see that you get a good one somehow.
SUPMALE:You're not old enough for school yet.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, there's plenty of time for school.
LEADFEMALE:Think of all the fun you're having around home.
LEADMALE:You have got to be kidding.
LEADMALE:You think it's fun just going upstairs and coming back downstairs and occasionally having some Chinese food? Do you call that living? Mearth.
LEADMALE:- Sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:- No! Sweetheart, you're a special little boy and you're just gonna have to be patient till we make Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:We make special arrangements.
SUPFEMALE:No! No.
OTHERFEMALE:Mearth, now mellow out.
LEADMALE:Mellow out.
OTHERMALE:"Mellow out, mellow out.
SUPFEMALE:" I wanna go to school.
LEADMALE:I wanna be like the rest of the children.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going to sit here with four or five boxes of empty goldfish cartons.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna go to school.
OTHERFEMALE:That's enough, young man.
LEADFEMALE:Go to your room.
LEADMALE:- I said, I wanted to go to school.
LEADFEMALE:- Go up now.
LEADMALE:It really didn't hurt me at all.
LEADMALE:You just happened to crush my Karl Malden picture.
LEADMALE:School.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna go to school and I said I wanted to go to school.
LEADMALE:I'm going.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mork, I don't mean to interfere, but I think you've got a big problem on your hands.
SUPMALE:Psst.
LEADFEMALE:Psst.
LEADMALE:Not now, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:I've gotta get up in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:It's not Mork.
LEADMALE:It's Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Um, where are you? I'm using the speaker in Mork's ear.
OTHERMALE:You and I need to have a talk.
SUPMALE:- Now? - Yes, now.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not here to make an appointment with you.
LEADMALE:But I'm not gonna go into Mork's head.
SUPMALE:That's an invasion of his privacy.
LEADMALE:But then he and I never did have any secrets.
SUPMALE:How do I do this again? Mindy calling Orson, come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy calling Orson, come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mindy calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Yo, your space Mountainship! Oh, that was a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:I apologize.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know where that came from.
LEADMALE:I really didn't mean to say that.
SUPFEMALE:You're excused.
SUPMALE:When you're using Mork's mind, there's bound to be some ill effects.
LEADFEMALE:Could you turn the heat up? It's kind of cold in here.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry, Mork's mind isn't equipped with a thermostat.
OTHERFEMALE:I told him to insulate.
LEADMALE:Coffee.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:So how's the family? - Oh, they're just - Enough small talk.
LEADFEMALE:Where's the application Mork promised to fill out? Well For what? I want Mearth's application for Ork Prep.
SUPFEMALE:I sent it to Mork bleams ago and I haven't heard from him since.
LEADMALE:Oh So that's why Mork was acting so strange at dinner.
LEADMALE:And I thought it was the MSG.
LEADMALE:What? Never mind.
SUPFEMALE:Um, Orson, I don't know how I feel about Mearth going away to school on Ork.
LEADFEMALE:You'll love it.
SUPFEMALE:He'll only go to school one day a month, Earth time.
LEADFEMALE:- He'll commute.
LEADFEMALE:- How? Air Ork's H-28 transport beam has merged with Glibthansa and is now servicing the greater Earth area.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, I'll discuss it with Mork and then we'll get back to you.
OTHERMALE:There will be no discussion.
SUPMALE:The application will be completed and on my desk in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you for the coffee.
OTHERMALE:It was delicious.
SUPMALE:My secret is egg shells in the grounds.
SUPFEMALE:You know, my grandmother used to do that.
SUPMALE:Who cares? Na-no, na-no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, uh, na-no, na-no to you too, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Aha! Sneaking around with Orson behind my brain? What were you two doing? Hmm? Huh? Hmm? Oh, I know.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:I'll take the positive approach.
OTHERFEMALE:You were planning a surprise party for me.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I'll play along.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:A belt sander.
SUPMALE:You shouldn't have.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, honey, honey, honey.
LEADMALE:- Mork.
LEADMALE:"Pooter," little "pooter.
LEADFEMALE:" Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so surprised.
LEADMALE:Just when I thought everybody had forgotten.
LEADMALE:Mork, why didn't you tell me about the application to Ork Prep? Does this mean there's no surprise party, Mind? Oh, Mind, you know, well, preppies can be such snobs, Mind, you know, "Biffy, a Krugerrand seems to have fallen out of your loafer.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Muffy, come here, chap.
LEADMALE:Take that alligator off your shirt, it's been dead for a month now.
LEADMALE:" Mearth has to go to school.
LEADFEMALE:And he's gotta be around kids like himself to be able to learn.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, Mind, but there's no substitute for experience.
SUPMALE:I mean, look at me.
LEADFEMALE:I know all the hosts of Real People.
LEADMALE:Let's see, Skip Stephenson, John Barbour, Sara Purcell, and that black guy.
LEADMALE:Why don't you want Mearth to go to school? The truth of the matter is, Mind, he's growing up and he won't need me.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I should just go sit in the shed with his training wheels.
LEADMALE:And that tire that he uses for a teething ring.
LEADMALE:Mork, Mearth needs you now more than ever.
LEADMALE:Look, you know all about Ork.
LEADFEMALE:You can answer his questions.
LEADMALE:And, anyway, it's only one day a month.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you're absolutely right.
LEADMALE:I feel a little self-indulgent recently.
SUPFEMALE:I feel like Ronald Reagan at a budget meeting.
SUPMALE:So, what do you say we get to that old application? Well, can't it wait till the morning? That's all right, just one little page anyway.
OTHERMALE:I hid it in Merv Griffin's autobiography.
LEADFEMALE:I thought nobody'd ever look in here.
LEADFEMALE:Hurry up, Mearth, you're gonna be late.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mommy, Daddy, I'm all ready for school.
LEADFEMALE:Look at me.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I shined my shoes until they're almost silver.
LEADMALE:I shaved my face so close so that other children can identify with me.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, Mind, I can't take it.
SUPFEMALE:It seems like he was hatched just yesterday.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry, Dad, I'll be home this afternoon.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but that means I'll have to watch People's Court alone.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind.
LEADMALE:We agreed there wasn't going to be a scene.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you're right, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy was a little emotional, but he's over it now.
SUPFEMALE:Like the time that he heard that Tom Snyder was quitting.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:There's the school beam now.
SUPFEMALE:All right, son, you take care and you make me real proud of you.
LEADMALE:Remember, at school you join the band, don't be the organ carrier.
SUPMALE:Oh, they're hairy.
LEADMALE:Here, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:You have a good day, okay? I'll see you when you get home.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Gosh, well, Mommy, Daddy, I'm still here.
OTHERFEMALE:You might just be a big Oh, Mind, he's gone.
LEADMALE:So is my couch, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing? Would you believe it? I'm cleaning my oven.
OTHERFEMALE:How are they biting? Not too bad.
OTHERMALE:I had one little 5-foot Avon lady, but she got away.
LEADMALE:Mork, just because the baby's gone away to school is no reason to go crazy.
LEADMALE:All right, Mind, got a bite.
SUPFEMALE:Wait.
OTHERMALE:Our mail.
LEADFEMALE:Yay.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Maybe it's a letter from him.
LEADMALE:- Oh, it's my Book of the Month Club.
LEADFEMALE:- The Early Years.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, do you realize how long it's been since we've been together alone? Isn't there anything that you could think of that the two of us might do on a snowy afternoon? We could have our second annual Punt, Pass and Kick competition.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yay, huzzah, he's returned! Yo, my boy, my boy, my son, my son, my son.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, huzzah, huzzah, it's him, it's him, it's him.
LEADMALE:Mearth, what are you doing home? There's five hours left of school.
OTHERFEMALE:I hate it there and I'm not going back there.
SUPMALE:I hate it! I'm not going back there.
LEADFEMALE:I hate it! I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, besides that, son, how was your day? Mearth, will you stop saying, "I hate it, I hate it, I hate it," - and just tell us what happened? - I hate it.
LEADMALE:I do hate it.
LEADMALE:The kids call me names and that teacher, Miss Geezba, oh, she's cruel.
OTHERFEMALE:I hate her, I hate her, I hate her.
SUPMALE:Is she still alive? Oh, I had Miss Geezba too.
LEADMALE:Boy, Mind, I hate her, I hate her, I hate her.
LEADMALE:This is not what I call a positive attitude.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, you don't know Miss Geezba.
LEADMALE:It's like saying disarmament to Alexander Haig.
SUPFEMALE:Mearth, you know something? I had teachers I didn't like too, but you know what? They were usually the ones I learned the most from.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't fit in any world.
LEADMALE:This is just worse than being called Butchie, the dog-faced boy.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mearth, sweetheart, don't you say that.
LEADMALE:You're just the new kid in school and that's not easy.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, did you ever see Massacre at Central High? You know what, Mearth? I came home crying my first day at school too.
LEADMALE:And I never would have gone back if my mom and dad hadn't taken me to class.
SUPFEMALE:Tell you what, how would you feel about going back to Ork Prep if Daddy and I went with you? Well, I'll see what Teddy says.
LEADMALE:I only have trust in you.
LEADMALE:Tell the truth, Teddy.
LEADMALE:He says yes.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, the two of you have a nice time.
OTHERMALE:The three of us will have a nice time, Mork.
SUPMALE:I'm sure Miss Geezba will be very happy with the way you turned out.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think so, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Once on a field trip to the sun, she made me wear a coat.
LEADMALE:- I hate her, I hate her, I hate her.
LEADFEMALE:- I hate her, I hate her, I hate her.
OTHERFEMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:I've never had my molecules scattered all over the universe before.
SUPMALE:- Am I all here? - Well, yes, except you're bald.
SUPMALE:Made you look, made you look, made you look, Mind.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, I'm just so happy to be back at school again, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:- Hello.
LEADFEMALE:- Mearth.
OTHERFEMALE:Young man, we do not leave the room without getting a hall pass.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, sweetheart, I'm Mearth's mother.
OTHERFEMALE:Could you tell me where Miss Geezba is? I'm Miss Geezba and don't talk down to me.
LEADMALE:- Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Ma'am.
LEADFEMALE:You still owe me a book report.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, ma'am.
LEADFEMALE:The last one burned up on re-entry.
LEADMALE:Oh, please don't do that.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to have lobes hanging down to my knees.
LEADFEMALE:See, I told you that she was tougher than a rawhide chew stick.
SUPMALE:I'm talking about you.
OTHERFEMALE:Mearth.
LEADMALE:Miss Geezba Uh, Mearth came home very upset, and we were hoping we could talk to you about him adjusting to this environment.
SUPFEMALE:See here, I've been a teacher for 43 bleams, and no one tells me how to run my classroom.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I'm not trying to tell you how to run your business, you little It's just we were trying to make this a more positive experience for Mearth.
SUPMALE:I'm sure everything will be fine once Mearth gets to know the other children and our alphabet.
SUPFEMALE:You're welcome to observe as long as he behaves.
LEADMALE:I hate her.
LEADMALE:I hate her.
LEADMALE:I hate her.
LEADMALE:What did I tell you? What did I tell you? She's the house of correction.
LEADMALE:She is a mean, little, small person.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look, Mind, aren't they cute at this age? Oh, Mearth, I missed you at recess.
LEADFEMALE:I waited for you in the sandbox.
LEADMALE:That's very nice.
LEADFEMALE:He's already made little friends.
SUPMALE:I have a feeling she's everybody's little friend.
LEADMALE:Oh, Earth-head, Earth-head, listen, uh, I'm sorry I was mean to you this morning.
SUPFEMALE:- That's okay, Ovits.
SUPMALE:- Isn't that nice, Mearth? I'll tell you what.
LEADMALE:Why don't we shake and make up? - You're not kidding me? - Here's my hand.
LEADMALE:Ovits's hand.
OTHERMALE:Fighting again, Mork? Take your seat.
LEADMALE:Yes, ma'am.
LEADFEMALE:But did you see what that other kid did? He No, I didn't.
LEADMALE:And no one likes a tattletale.
SUPMALE:Sit! To hit a child.
LEADFEMALE:To hit a child.
LEADFEMALE:Sweetheart, you sit down and we'll be back there.
SUPFEMALE:Mommy and Daddy, remember, no matter what happens, I still love you.
LEADMALE:Listen, Earth-head, if you don't want old Geezba to call on you, when she asks a question, all you have to do is raise your hand.
LEADFEMALE:Got it? Raise your hand when she asks a question, - she won't pick on you.
LEADFEMALE:- Can I be sure of this, Ovits? What are friends for? Class, can anyone tell me who invented the flying saucer? Mearth? - Well, Mearth? - Benjamin Franklin.
OTHERFEMALE:Aretha Franklin.
LEADMALE:That will be enough, class! Don't worry.
SUPMALE:Colleges are very expensive nowadays, anyway.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's begin Manilow appreciation.
SUPFEMALE:Mommy, Daddy, you can't make me stay here.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you can, but if you do, I'll hold my breath.
LEADMALE:Mearth, don't you worry.
LEADFEMALE:Mommy's gonna go talk to that little old pipsqueak.
LEADMALE:Now, Mind, come on, we've gotta come down to Ork here.
LEADFEMALE:You have never been the object of ridicule except for that time when you tried to play the Mikado.
LEADFEMALE:Son, I know exactly how you feel.
OTHERMALE:See, when I was going to school, I was the one they made fun of.
SUPFEMALE:Kids will make fun of you as long as you let them.
LEADFEMALE:But if you've got pride in yourself, there's nothing that anyone can say.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right.
OTHERFEMALE:Hold your chin up high.
SUPFEMALE:Then they can really deck you.
LEADMALE:Do you have any idea what it's like sitting next to Ovits? - Just ignore Ovits.
LEADMALE:- I will.
LEADFEMALE:Just ignore Ovits.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, class, that's enough Manilow.
SUPMALE:We don't wanna get your blood sugar level too high.
SUPMALE:Now, boys and girls, it's time for show and tell.
SUPFEMALE:Who wants to go first? I've got something I'd like to show Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:Zelka, when you have something new to show, raise your hand.
SUPMALE:Perhaps Mearth has something he'd like to share.
OTHERFEMALE:Well Well, as a matter of fact, I do.
SUPMALE:Miss Geezba.
LEADFEMALE:I guess first of all, most of you by this time know that I'm from Earth.
OTHERFEMALE:I have something that none of you have here on Ork.
LEADFEMALE:None of you.
LEADFEMALE:I have parents.
LEADMALE:Parents? What are those? Well, Mommy and Daddy, come on down.
LEADMALE:Listen, listen, what can parents do that a test tube don't? Well, for instance, uh, you drop them, they don't break.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you some other things.
SUPFEMALE:First of all they, well, both of them brought me life and love.
LEADMALE:Also, the one thing they don't let me do is barbecue in the bedroom.
LEADMALE:That's bad.
SUPFEMALE:But when I'm real good And I try to be most of the time, don't I? - They always give me something like this.
OTHERMALE:- Wow, what is that? - Oh, could I see that? - What does it do? - Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:- Well - This is small.
LEADFEMALE:- This is a frog.
LEADFEMALE:- A frog? Yes, see, he's amphibious.
LEADMALE:That's a very big word for me, amphibious.
SUPFEMALE:That means he can swim in the water and he's also pretty good on the land.
LEADMALE:And he eats flies, of course, has a long tongue, and also you find him in some of the better French restaurants.
LEADMALE:And he goes: Excuse me, Earth-head, could I hold him? If you let me hold him, I promise you, I won't hit you no more.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:You hold your hands real high.
LEADMALE:- Like that? - A little higher in the palms.
OTHERFEMALE:- Keep your palms up.
LEADFEMALE:- Okay.
OTHERMALE:- That's right.
SUPFEMALE:- Okay.
LEADMALE:You know, I could really deck you right now.
LEADFEMALE:But I won't.
SUPMALE:Why? Because I'm bigger than you are.
SUPMALE:What a wonderful child I am.
SUPMALE:Your little boy's going to be just fine.
LEADMALE:- Oh, well, goodbye.
OTHERFEMALE:- Goodbye.
LEADMALE:- Thank you for letting us observe.
LEADFEMALE:- You're welcome.
SUPFEMALE:- Stand up straight, Mork.
SUPMALE:- Ma'am.
OTHERFEMALE:And don't forget that book report.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, ma'am, I'd doing it on the Wit and Wisdom of Richard Nixon.
OTHERMALE:It'll be a one-page essay.
LEADFEMALE:- Thank you for letting us observe.
LEADMALE:- You're welcome.
LEADFEMALE:You know something? You handled that so well with Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:- You're a good father.
LEADMALE:- Oh, bless you, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:We've got another hour until the next beam.
LEADMALE:- How about we go shopping? - Okay, that sounds like fun.
SUPMALE:Good.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe we can buy you a normal-size nose.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in your Fat-Farmness.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Sir.
LEADFEMALE:- Good to see you.
LEADMALE:- Oh, good to see you too, sir.
LEADMALE:How's the little fella doing in school? Well, I'm proud to say, sir, a lot better than I did.
LEADMALE:- That's my godson.
LEADFEMALE:- He is indeed, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Today Ork Prep, tomorrow Ork Med.
LEADMALE:Well, that's a very nice thought, but I'm not sure that'd be Mearth's choice.
OTHERFEMALE:I've learned that although it's good to encourage your child to shoot for the stars, it's not always good to choose which galaxy.
LEADFEMALE:If it's up to parents, there'd be three jobs in the whole world: Doctor, lawyer and wholesale jeweler.
LEADMALE:But don't you want Mearth to pursue a career you can be proud of? Well, sir, that's not our decision.
OTHERMALE:We'll honor his choice, even if he wants to become a network executive.
SUPFEMALE:Until next week, sir, na-no, na-no.
OTHERMALE:Na-no, na-no.
LEADMALE:Hi, I'm home.
SUPMALE:He's your son! You go up there and talk to him! - What? - You're gonna get it now! Your mother's home! Don't make a face like that.
LEADFEMALE:It might freeze that way.
LEADFEMALE:And take that out of your mouth.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know where it's been.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, what ever happened to, "Hi, little pooter, big kiss"? Oh, sure, think of yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Think of yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:No one thinks about the poor, little house-maker, except for Richard Simmons.
LEADMALE:Thighs, thighs, go away, send them all to Doris Day.
LEADFEMALE:What are you so hysterical about? Hysterical? Moi? Hm.
LEADMALE:Your son is up there doing things that would embarrass the Turkish police.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you You go upstairs and you beat some sense into him.
OTHERFEMALE:Ugh.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh! Oh! My head.
SUPFEMALE:I can hear snails crawl.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I can't come home every day and be the villain.
SUPMALE:You better take some responsibility too.
SUPMALE:When there's a disciplinary problem, you're gonna have to learn how to handle it.
LEADFEMALE:I guess you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just go talk some sense into him.
LEADFEMALE:If he doesn't listen, I'll take him to a filling station and make him look at the men's room.
OTHERFEMALE:And if that doesn't work, hell, we could always buy him a pony - and own his soul for life.
LEADMALE:- See, Mork, there's the problem.
OTHERMALE:You can't bounce from one extreme to the other like that.
SUPMALE:Tell that to Eldridge Cleaver.
OTHERMALE:We're both new at parenthood, but we can't fall apart every time he misbehaves.
LEADMALE:I mean, look, Mork, the key to being a good parent is consistency.
LEADMALE:Do you understand? No.
LEADFEMALE:I also don't know why they make Häagen-Dazs ice cream in the Bronx.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, you got some carob? I want some carob.
LEADFEMALE:Look, let's go upstairs and act like two calm, responsible parents, okay? We can handle this Bowling? I don't believe it.
LEADMALE:Neither do I.
LEADFEMALE:That's a really tough split.
SUPMALE:Son.
OTHERMALE:Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, have I missed you.
SUPMALE:Well, I missed you too, - sweetheart.
SUPMALE:- Oh.
LEADMALE:That's nice of you to say that.
SUPFEMALE:- Your room is a mess.
OTHERFEMALE:- Mm.
SUPMALE:You wanna tell me why you were bowling in the house? Yes, it happened to be league night and all the lanes were spoken for.
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Smarty Pants, you have an answer for everything, don't you? Hm? Ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:How about this one? If the speed of light is 186,000 miles per second and the speed of a slug is one inch an hour, how long has Robert Conrad had that battery on his shoulder? What are you talking about? This is no time for brain teasers, Mork.
LEADMALE:Go over there and reason with your son.
LEADFEMALE:- Right, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- Consistency.
LEADMALE:I remember that.
SUPMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:I've seen Ordinary People twice.
LEADMALE:Saw Popeye once.
OTHERMALE:- Son? - Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Dad.
SUPFEMALE:- It's a nice shirt.
SUPMALE:- Mork.
LEADMALE:Just warming him up.
LEADMALE:Son, the real guts of the matter is that, well, how would you feel if you had any of your little friends over here and they saw this pigsty? Easy.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't West Point.
OTHERFEMALE:This is no white-glove inspection.
OTHERMALE:This is my lifestyle.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, you said something though, however.
LEADMALE:You said something about having some friends over? - That's what he said.
LEADMALE:- Didn't he? - Sure, and - How about even sleepover? Well, Mearth, if you could prove to us that you're a responsible young man who takes a little pride in his possessions, then maybe we'll see.
LEADMALE:- Me too? - No.
LEADFEMALE:- You think about what we said.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:- Sure will.
OTHERFEMALE:- Bye-bye, son.
LEADMALE:- Bye, Dad.
SUPMALE:You handled that like a real father.
OTHERFEMALE:- You did reason with him.
LEADMALE:- Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:Let's talk about the bathroom, the pantyhose jungle.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I think Just wondering, I've got to really clean this mess up so I can have some friends over.
SUPMALE:Okay, here goes.
SUPFEMALE:- Morning, little pooter.
LEADMALE:- Mm.
SUPFEMALE:You sleep well? Oh, yeah, till about 3, when you took all the covers.
LEADFEMALE:Well, actually I took them about 1, but you didn't notice.
SUPFEMALE:And your little bones shaking helped me fall asleep.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Come here, I'll keep you warm.
LEADFEMALE:There we go.
OTHERMALE:- Thanks.
LEADMALE:- Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Oh-ho-ho-ho.
SUPMALE:Oh Good morning, good morning How we doing this morning? Baby Mearth, your model child, is here Baby Mearth has fixed you breakfast, Mommy and Daddy.
LEADMALE:Yes, that's so nice.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't had breakfast in bed since I had my tonsils out.
LEADFEMALE:Are you kidding? How about this? Banana for the lady? No, sweetheart, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:You've just been a little angel these last few days.
LEADMALE:I sure try.
OTHERMALE:I really have.
SUPMALE:I have.
LEADMALE:- I've had something in mind too.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh.
LEADMALE:I want you to have the breakfast right here on your lap.
OTHERMALE:- Okay.
SUPFEMALE:- You put that right down there.
LEADMALE:Am I out of line, by any chance, in thinking that perhaps a reward is due me? Mind? Mind, be careful.
OTHERFEMALE:This is a setup for the pony.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, not at all.
SUPFEMALE:Not necessarily.
SUPMALE:Remember, Mommy, per our little lecture, that I said if I cleaned up my room and I was good, and here I've served you breakfast and everything, that you might let me have some of my friends over? Oh, sure, sweetheart, you can have some friends over.
OTHERMALE:Are you kidding? Well, then, come on down, kids.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Mommy and Daddy, allow me to introduce my classmates and schoolmates from Ork.
LEADMALE:This is Zelka and this is Ovits.
LEADFEMALE:- Na-no, na-no.
LEADMALE:- Na-no.
LEADMALE:- Na-no.
OTHERFEMALE:- Boy, this is really raznik.
LEADMALE:Yeah, this is Earth, huh? Heh.
LEADMALE:And I thought Pluto was tacky.
LEADFEMALE:Those kids are amazing.
LEADFEMALE:We turn our backs for one second and they cloned the phone.
LEADMALE:Look on the bright side though.
SUPFEMALE:If we ever have a telethon, we're prepared.
LEADMALE:- Hello.
LEADFEMALE:- Hello.
LEADMALE:- Hello.
SUPMALE:Hello.

LEADMALE:- Oh, dear.
LEADFEMALE:- Are you kids okay? Ovits zapped George's head.
OTHERFEMALE:- What happened, Mearth? - He zapped his head off.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's his head now? Well, it's somewhere over Denver.
SUPMALE:- Ovits.
LEADFEMALE:- Ovits, you're mean, mean, mean.
LEADFEMALE:- Thank you, thank you, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:- I'll tell you, Ovits, you are - Shut up, you wimp! I'll get you.
LEADFEMALE:- Okay, time-out.
SUPMALE:Mork Mearth.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought Orkans were supposed to be non-violent.
OTHERMALE:Mearth, Ovits, I want you two to make up right now, or you're gonna spend the rest of the day in the corner.
LEADFEMALE:I don't wanna.
LEADFEMALE:I don't wanna.
LEADFEMALE:- I don't wan - Ovits! Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I am I am sorry I, uh I blew George's head off.
SUPMALE:I was probably just suffering from beam lag.
LEADFEMALE:Arg.
OTHERMALE:- I'm gonna tell you something - Mearth.
LEADMALE:I was about to say it.
SUPMALE:I want to tell you something, not to you, Mommy, ever.
SUPMALE:But to you.
LEADMALE:To you, you're hateful, mean, nasty, but, Ovits, you're fair.
LEADMALE:Well, that's good.
LEADFEMALE:Now shake.
LEADFEMALE:That's better.
LEADMALE:Oh, too bad.
LEADFEMALE:It's time to go home.
LEADMALE:There's the beam.

LEADFEMALE:Mearth asked me to sleep over.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mearth.
OTHERFEMALE:I wanna hear that new Olivia Newton-John record again.
LEADFEMALE:- Let's Get Physical? - Yeah.
SUPMALE:It makes me crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Zelka can't spend the night, can she? Well, we gave our permission, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, consistency.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, come off it, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, they're innocent, they're just kids.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, I guess you're right.
SUPFEMALE:This aging reverse thing is just It's hard to get the hang of.
OTHERFEMALE:I keep forgetting that in their minds they're just babies.
SUPFEMALE:Even though their bodies are anatomically correct.
LEADFEMALE:When you think about it, you know, Mearth's just into snakes and snails - and puppy dog tails.
SUPFEMALE:- And Miss January.
OTHERMALE:Cowabunga, Buffalo Bob.
LEADFEMALE:Oh-ho-ho.
SUPFEMALE:And look at that, sitting on a tractor too.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mork, see what I mean? I mean, we never know what he's gonna do next.
SUPMALE:He's just growing up so fast.
SUPFEMALE:But I'll tell you one thing, when boys start reading magazines like these, it's time for their father to have a little talk about the difference between boys and girls.
SUPMALE:We've already worked that out.
LEADMALE:I mean, I've told him that boys like to play sports and girls like to wear makeup, and if you're Alice Cooper, you can do both.
OTHERMALE:Like I said, we need to have a little talk.
SUPFEMALE:Look, after Zelka leaves, the three of us are gonna sit down and have a discussion about the birds and the bees.
LEADMALE:Well, all right, Mind, but I still say he's too young for this.
LEADFEMALE:Mommy, let me ask you something.
LEADFEMALE:Am I out of line in asking you for a stethoscope? Well, sweetheart, I don't have a stethoscope.
LEADMALE:Oh, guess I'll have to use my ear.
OTHERFEMALE:My son, the doctor.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, we're gonna have to keep our eyes on those kids all night long.
LEADFEMALE:We can't go upstairs right now, Mind.
LEADMALE:We have to scrub up first.
LEADFEMALE:He might be in surgery.
OTHERMALE:Well, isn't this fun? Camping out in the living room all together? Yeah, you get the best of both worlds.
LEADMALE:You get that great outdoor feeling and that great indoor carpet.
OTHERMALE:What is happening here? You tell me, what is happening here? I mean, all I wanted to do was to take a hot bath with Zelka, and suddenly, we're the Wilderness Family.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, kids, where's your pioneer spirit? Come on.
SUPMALE:We're sitting around the old Sterno.
LEADFEMALE:We can swap stories and make stew, or we can swap stew and make stories, or we can all get stewed.
LEADFEMALE:Does anybody have a good story they'd like to tell? Hm? Well, I've got this great story about the first time I baked raisin loaf.
OTHERMALE:Come on, Mind, that's a classic.
LEADMALE:Arg, arg, arg, arg.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mearth, I've got one.
LEADMALE:I was at the Ork Farm milking a fring and this traveling salesman came along and asked me if I wanted to see what was in his sample case.
LEADMALE:Would anyone like a soft drink? No, thank you.
LEADMALE:So I said no and he went away and I never saw him again.
SUPFEMALE:- The end.
SUPMALE:- Oh.
OTHERMALE:That's great, Zelka.
LEADMALE:That's more plot than Kurt Vonnegut ever uses.
LEADMALE:I think this is a perfect time for my raisin loaf story.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, not yet, Mind.
LEADMALE:You don't want to peak too soon.
LEADMALE:Arg, arg, arg.
SUPMALE:It'll slay you.
SUPMALE:Well, come on now, kids.
LEADMALE:Kids' game.
SUPMALE:Tell you what.
SUPFEMALE:How about this? Let's pretend we're not even in the living room, but we'll use our imaginations and go to the deepest, darkest jungle, you know? Now Larry, Aquarius.
SUPMALE:Oh, now listen, look, animals everywhere.
LEADFEMALE:Now come on.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, if we can just keep a couple of these things for San Diego Zoo.
LEADFEMALE:Come on now, son.
LEADFEMALE:Son, you'll be the great white hunter.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the reasonable white hunter.
LEADMALE:And I'll be I'll be your faithful gun-bearer, Peba.
LEADFEMALE:I will cut a way through the jungle.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, good.
SUPMALE:Forget that.
LEADMALE:Oh, careful of the little feller.
SUPFEMALE:Ah.
OTHERMALE:You've done a magnificent job.
LEADFEMALE:What? I'm sorry, your name again.
SUPFEMALE:- Ibusay.
LEADMALE:- Ibusay.
LEADMALE:Yes, you changed in Nairobi.
LEADFEMALE:It's all right.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's move along here.
LEADMALE:Do you have a gun of any kind? I don't want that machete.
LEADMALE:Whatever you want, boss.
SUPMALE:We got a telescopic sight here.
LEADMALE:And if you get real close, we got a putter.
LEADFEMALE:And if they get real close, you won't see me around here.
SUPMALE:Let's get on with the animals.
SUPFEMALE:Look! One of them's charging now.
SUPMALE:He doesn't even have credit.
SUPFEMALE:Go ahead, go.
LEADFEMALE:Shoot the sucker! Shoot the sucker! Shoot the sucker.
LEADMALE:Get at it, get at it, get at it! The animal has obviously got a thorn in its paw.
LEADMALE:Give it a chance.
LEADFEMALE:Good Lord.
LEADFEMALE:Give me the small handgun.
LEADMALE:Hold onto it.
LEADFEMALE:Look at it.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes if you mock them, they hate it.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh.
LEADFEMALE:- There, that's just right for the living room.
SUPMALE:- Carry on.
LEADMALE:Hear, hear.
LEADMALE:- Look, a snake! - Where? - A snake coming, boss! Oh, it's got you now! It's got you now, boss! Oh, you're up for it now.
SUPMALE:Wait, I'll spin you out of it.
SUPMALE:It's got me now! It's got me now.
LEADMALE:- Look what it did - Look! It's coming now.
LEADFEMALE:Cream him! What do I do with this snake? Make it a boa.
OTHERMALE:Somebody'll wear it.
SUPMALE:Well, ha, all right.
LEADMALE:Approach him gently.
OTHERFEMALE:Give me that bazooka.
SUPMALE:- I'm not going to fool around.
LEADFEMALE:- All right, there it is! Here's the shell coming in.
LEADFEMALE:Ready? Yes.
LEADMALE:Gee Where's the bloody aspirin? Well, boy, you hit me.
LEADFEMALE:I thought it was a monkey had fallen on me.
LEADMALE:Either that or just a pregnant baboon.
LEADFEMALE:Well, they're almost there! It's an elephant on Valium, so we got time.
SUPFEMALE:All right, put a shell in it, quickly.
LEADMALE:- I'll put another one in.
LEADFEMALE:- Put one in quickly.
OTHERMALE:Oh! Oh! Oh, boy, has that sucker got a kick.
SUPMALE:Ooh, you done it now.
SUPMALE:You've killed Marlin Perkins.
LEADFEMALE:- Morning.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh.
SUPMALE:- Yeah, Mind.
LEADMALE:Isn't this the life, huh? - Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, no noise, no smog, no Underall commercials.
OTHERMALE:- No kids.
LEADFEMALE:- Hm? Where's Mearth and Zelka? Let's get physical - Physical, physical - Physical, physical - Let's get physical - Let's get physical - My body says talk - Talk Mind, he's your son.
LEADFEMALE:Good luck.
LEADMALE:- What were you kids doing up there? - Sleeping.
LEADMALE:We couldn't sleep in the living room because there was so much noise.
LEADMALE:Yeah, she's right.
LEADMALE:You know, Mommy, even though you have a little bump of a nose, you snore loud.
OTHERMALE:Gee, Mearth, thanks for not letting me sleep alone.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, maybe he was just being a good host, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, there's the beam, Zelka, you have to go home now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, gee, gee, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:And Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:McConnell, thank you for letting me stay over.
LEADMALE:You have a great son! I enjoyed him very much.
SUPMALE:Boy, am I gonna miss you.
LEADMALE:Ooh, am I gonna miss you.
LEADMALE:See you back in school.
SUPFEMALE:I get a chance to sleep over at your house.
LEADMALE:Na-no.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I gotta tell you something, Mommy and Daddy, they gotta really work the kinks out of that beam.
OTHERFEMALE:I think we've postponed having our little talk long enough.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you're right.
LEADMALE:I guess I'm in the batter's box right now.
LEADMALE:Mm-hm.
LEADMALE:- Come along, son.
LEADMALE:Surely.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:- Son? - Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Good training, remember it.
LEADMALE:Son, ahem, that's another nice shirt you have there.
OTHERFEMALE:Strike one.
SUPMALE:Mind, I think you're calling them a little close, aren't you? All right, son, basically in this world, there are two types of people, let's just say male and female.
SUPMALE:- Now, which is which? - Oh, you learn that on the street.
SUPFEMALE:And these male and female, they fall in love, and they register at Bloomingdale's, then they get married, and they try to marry up all their other single friends.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I like the raisin loaf story better.
OTHERMALE:- I think you left something out.
LEADMALE:- Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, sometimes they don't register.
SUPMALE:They just ask for the cash.
OTHERMALE:I meant the part about how the babies get to be babies.
SUPMALE:I don't think he's interested in that right now.
SUPMALE:I am interested in that right now.
LEADFEMALE:All right, um, son, um Ahem.
OTHERFEMALE:See, this, um And this No.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm-mm, mm-mm.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
SUPMALE:Um Son Oh, boy.
SUPMALE:You know, the only way I can really do this is a mind probe.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that's it.
LEADMALE:Well, here we go, son.
SUPFEMALE:Hold on.
SUPMALE:That's how babies are made.
LEADMALE:That's how babies are made? Wait a minute, Daddy.
LEADMALE:What's that got to do with me? Well, sweetheart, Zelka said you didn't sleep alone.
LEADFEMALE:- Did she say that? Mm-hm.
SUPMALE:Well, she didn't sleep alone exactly.
LEADFEMALE:I gave her my teddy bear.
SUPMALE:So she slept with Teddy upstairs.
LEADMALE:And as a matter of fact, I slept downstairs in your bed.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh.
LEADMALE:- You see? And, incidentally, about your story, the time will come when I'll understand it.
LEADFEMALE:Now, it's time for me to go.
SUPMALE:- Sweetheart? - Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Um, if you don't understand Daddy's story, then why was that funny magazine in your pocket? Heh.
SUPFEMALE:- Remember? - I remember.
LEADMALE:Of course I remember.
LEADMALE:As a matter of fact, that was in Mr.
SUPMALE:Bickley's garbage.
LEADFEMALE:And, as a matter of fact, I was gonna make some, uh, paper airplanes out of it, but I thought better about that.
SUPMALE:- I dismissed it.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'd better get going right now, and I wanted to make the beds.
LEADFEMALE:I really want to make them real good, you know, because next time around, I want to stay over at Zelka's.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Sure did jump to conclusions, didn't we? Zelka slept with his teddy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You know what the really hard part is now? What? I have to go tell a teddy bear the facts of life.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Cellulite Central.
SUPMALE:Arg.
LEADMALE:- Ah, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Sir.
LEADMALE:Just in time to play some Rack-Ork-Ball.
LEADFEMALE:- Sir? - I need to practice.
SUPFEMALE:I'm playing in a celebrity tournament on the planet Fuca.
LEADMALE:Well, what about my report, sir? You can give your report while we play.
SUPMALE:- Sir.
LEADMALE:- Service! Sir, this week my report is about parenthood.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
SUPFEMALE:Again? You know, Mork, I could use a little variety.
LEADMALE:Well, sir, how about a little topspin on this one? Lately, all you seem to talk about is raising your son.
LEADMALE:Well, sir, it's a very tough job keeping the children of today from becoming the children of tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:- Out.
OTHERFEMALE:- Sir? I beg to differ with you.
LEADMALE:I think that was in.
LEADFEMALE:I said out.
LEADMALE:Well, ha-ha-ha, who am I to question one of your judgments? Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:He'd never get away with this at Wimbledon.
LEADFEMALE:Na-no, na-no.
SUPFEMALE:Only my husband would buy out the entire airport gift shop in his own hometown.
LEADFEMALE:Will you take off the silly hat? You look like a character from Tumbleweeds.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, Mind.
LEADMALE:I had to do something though.
LEADFEMALE:I really miss our little bouncing baby-man.
LEADFEMALE:I do too.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna miss Mearth.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, but it's good for him to be with Dad in Florida.
LEADMALE:Just think, they'll camp out, sleep under the stars, swat mosquitoes.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:- That's how Deliverance started.
LEADMALE:- Heh.
OTHERMALE:It'll be a good experience for him.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, you know, we could really use the time together.
LEADFEMALE:You think about it, Mork, the baby was born as soon as we got married.
OTHERMALE:We never had an opportunity to spend time together as just husband and wife.
LEADMALE:I'm still gonna miss the little buggerpoo.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Sneaking around with his Polaroid, trying to take pictures of us - in compromising positions.
OTHERMALE:- Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I'm gonna miss waking up to, "Mommy, how come you look so different in the morning?" And when I go to the park, who's gonna push me on the swing? Boy, listen to us.
LEADMALE:I think there's more to our marriage than just being parents.
SUPFEMALE:Just think, we can spend a whole week together, just the two of us.
OTHERMALE:You got any ideas? Well, there's an exciting new series on TV where the Osmond Family plays the Donner Party.
SUPMALE:I think we can do better than sitting around watching television.
LEADMALE:I really had something a little more exciting and exotic in mind.
LEADMALE:Well, we could buy a parrot.
LEADFEMALE:And teach it to talk dirty.
LEADMALE:Mind, come on, I was kidding.
LEADMALE:You know what I'm talking about.
LEADMALE:I know we're a couple of vibrant young people that wear trendy clothes.
LEADMALE:You know, the world belongs to us and the OPEC nations.
LEADFEMALE:- You smooth talker, you.
SUPFEMALE:- Mm Mm-hm-hm-hm.
OTHERMALE:- Mm.
LEADFEMALE:- Aah! Mork! The telephone.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
OTHERMALE:Shh! Stop it! Hello.
OTHERMALE:Yes, this is Mindy.
SUPMALE:Wait one second, please.
OTHERMALE:Mork, will you stop it? Wait, I'll be off in a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be off in a minute.
OTHERMALE:Shh, shh, shh.
LEADMALE:Hello? Yes, I'm back.
SUPMALE:Now? Yeah, but what about Dewey Fishbeck? Yes, sir.
LEADMALE:Okay, I'll be right over.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Oh, God.
OTHERMALE:Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:This isn't the way I wanted to start our week, but I've gotta go meet the camera crew.
LEADMALE:A used car dealer's been kidnapped, and nobody wants to pay the ransom.
LEADFEMALE:- Or cover the story.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, look, I understand, Mind.
LEADMALE:Business before pleasure.
SUPFEMALE:But don't worry, tonight when you come home, I'll give you Magic.
LEADFEMALE:And if I can't get him, I'll get Kareem.
LEADMALE:Ha.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? No.
LEADMALE:You know the words to this song.
LEADMALE:My boyfriend's back And there's gonna be trouble My boyfriend's back Mork, are the Arafats coming for bridge? No, no, Mind, I would like to welcome you to the wonderful world of Middle-Eastern cuisine.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome to Moroccafeller Center.
LEADMALE:If you're very nice to me, I might be able to get you your passport back.
LEADFEMALE:This is great.
SUPMALE:Everything looks so Moroccan.
LEADMALE:The pillows.
LEADFEMALE:Your falafel outfit.
LEADMALE:And the music.
LEADMALE:Yes, I taped it off this great Middle-Eastern station, K-FEZ.
LEADMALE:Talk about 16 with a bullet.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, Mork, you went to all this trouble.
LEADMALE:I feel like I should go to the river and do our laundry.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind, don't be afraid, because I have made you an incredible, original Moroccan meal.
SUPMALE:Totally traditional because I went out and begged for the ingredients.
OTHERFEMALE:Sit down.
SUPFEMALE:- There we go.
LEADMALE:- This how I'm supposed to sit? Well, that is if you're Yogi Berra.
LEADMALE:"Yo, right in there.
SUPFEMALE:" We must begin, first of all, by the traditional washing of the hands, which is traditional in most Moroccan meals and some Moroccan surgery.
LEADFEMALE:Dip your hands in there.
SUPFEMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:- Feels like dishwashing liquid.
LEADFEMALE:- It is, and you're soaking in it.
SUPMALE:There we go.
SUPMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:And now we must do the feet.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not gonna eat with my feet.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Damn, there goes dessert.
LEADMALE:- Mork, just sit down.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's talk.
LEADMALE:- All right, my dear.
OTHERMALE:My little macaroon.
SUPMALE:Mork, I love that you did this for me.
LEADMALE:- Oh - You know Oh, we'll have time for some chat later, but first, I must serve you the first course, the traditional Moroccan appetizer.
SUPFEMALE:Hold on and I will see, I will try to pronounce it for you.
LEADMALE:Let's see if I can pronounce it.
OTHERMALE:Fruit cocktail.
LEADMALE:What's Moroccan about that? Well, when I opened the can, it went: A little Slim Whitman.
SUPMALE:You're gonna love the next course.
SUPMALE:Couscous and mahi-mahi.
LEADFEMALE:I got the recipe from Lu-Lu in Walla Walla.
LEADFEMALE:How she got the recipe, I'll never know-know-know.
OTHERMALE:Um, there's no silverware.
LEADMALE:We're supposed to eat with our fingers? Yes, because all the silverware is used in Morocco to tunnel out of prison.
SUPFEMALE:First of all, you must take some of this.
SUPFEMALE:And Be careful there.
LEADFEMALE:Don't dip in the food.
LEADMALE:You can dip, but don't dip.
SUPMALE:Take a piece of this and take some And put some of that in there like this.
LEADFEMALE:And then you savor the taste.
OTHERMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:Heh-heh.
SUPMALE:- Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:- Mm.
SUPFEMALE:It's so hard to get fresh camel lips in Boulder, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:- Ooh.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh - You know, Mork, I have a confession.
LEADFEMALE:- What, Mind? I was afraid that with Mearth gone we wouldn't have anything to talk about.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, we'll have plenty of things to talk about, but after this.
LEADMALE:- Oh, what? - Ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:You'll see.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:- Who is that? - Oh, sorry.
LEADMALE:Fatima, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Mindy, Fatima.
LEADMALE:I would have gotten a snake-charmer, but his kid was having a Bar Mitzvah.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, it's different.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, it is.
LEADMALE:Not what I expected.
LEADFEMALE:I think she wants to dance with you, Mind.
LEADMALE:Uh, well, you go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:My navel jewel's off being appraised.
SUPFEMALE:It won't be the same effect without a halter top.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh Oh.
LEADMALE:Round two.
LEADFEMALE:You and Fatima chat.
SUPMALE:Maybe you can ask where she got these wonderful clothes.
LEADMALE:You dance really well.
LEADMALE:You know, Casablanca was my favorite film.
LEADFEMALE:Specialty of the house, - the shish kebab.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Or in the very elegant restaurants, "shish ke-Robert.
SUPMALE:" Since the beginning, we must have some more spices, a little brandy there.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-mm-mm.
LEADMALE:You can never have too much of this on there, huh? Yeah, now, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Is that supposed to be on fire? Well, it's kind of academic, Mind, because it is now.
LEADFEMALE:- Looks kind of hot.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, don't panic.
LEADMALE:I know how to deal with this.
SUPMALE:Don't panic at all.
LEADMALE:Fire! Fire! Mind, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't make a mess, hon.
OTHERMALE:There.
LEADFEMALE:Well - It's all right now.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah, it's all right.
LEADFEMALE:Next time, you schlep to Moroccan Town and barter with the man with one tooth going, "You must buy this.
OTHERMALE:You must buy this.
OTHERMALE:" Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry I ruined our perfect evening, Mind.
LEADMALE:I'm just tragedy's pawn.
LEADFEMALE:I feel like an outer space Eddie Fisher.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, it was no tragedy.
OTHERFEMALE:Nobody was hurt.
SUPFEMALE:You call burning up lamb at $9 a pound no tragedy? Believe me, there are worse things in life.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you feel that way, Mindy, because I think Fatima danced out of here with our toaster oven.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, I love what you tried to do.
LEADFEMALE:- But now the fire's out, - Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:- And Fatima's out, - Mm.
LEADMALE:And we're alone.
LEADMALE:Ah, you're right.
LEADMALE:We don't need external stimuli.
LEADFEMALE:We can make our own chemistry, huh? We'll have our own little Fourth of July without the vandalism.
SUPMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:Mm.
SUPFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Hm.
SUPFEMALE:You know that something Oh, no, you go Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh - Oh, no, go ahead.
SUPMALE:- Oh, no, you.
LEADFEMALE:I insist.
LEADFEMALE:Well, all right, I'll go.
LEADMALE:You know, there's something that's been bugging me - ever since I landed on Earth.
SUPMALE:- What? You know that song "This Old Man"? When he hits 12, what's he play knick-knack on? You actually wonder about things like that? You know when you get a song in your head Boing, boing, boing, boing.
LEADMALE:- I don't know.
OTHERMALE:- Oh.
OTHERMALE:Well, me too.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Catchy song, isn't it? Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:- Ow, this is great! - Great? We haven't said a word.
LEADMALE:No, look, I found a bicentennial quarter.
LEADMALE:- That's wonderful, Mind.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Mork, this is silly.
LEADFEMALE:Look at us.
LEADMALE:We're as uncomfortable as a pair of teenagers on a blind date.
LEADFEMALE:We must have something to talk about.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what do you want me to say, Mind? Well, I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:Anything.
SUPFEMALE:Ask me how work was.
LEADFEMALE:All right, how was work? Somebody parked in my parking place today.
LEADMALE:Boy, that's life in the big city, huh? Want me to ask how your lunch was? Oh, no.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not supposed to have to ask what to ask.
LEADFEMALE:- We're having a conversation.
LEADMALE:- Oh, no, Mind.
OTHERMALE:I mean, besides, I didn't know I have to ask what I have to ask when I don't know what I wanna ask when I wanna ask it.
SUPFEMALE:So now you're getting defensive? I'm not getting defensive.
LEADMALE:You're out of line.
SUPMALE:Mork, what's wrong with a husband and wife trying to have a conversation? I mean, look, our lives have been moving so fast.
SUPMALE:We haven't had a chance to talk about hardly anything.
SUPFEMALE:- Like what? - Well, like All right, for example, you've never said whether you like being married or not.
LEADMALE:- I do.
SUPMALE:- Well, why? - Well, lots of reasons.
OTHERFEMALE:- Well, give me one.
SUPMALE:Well, all right.
SUPFEMALE:- The bed's warmer.
LEADMALE:- Oh, that's it.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, if you wanted snappy repartee, you should have married William F.
SUPMALE:Buckley.
SUPFEMALE:"I find the institution of marriage quite appealing.
LEADMALE:" I'm sorry, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:I love you.
SUPMALE:Well, why? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, because you're warm and sensitive and unpredictable.
LEADFEMALE:And you're right, the bed is warmer.
SUPMALE:Now, don't you have something you'd like to say to me? - Yes.
LEADMALE:- What? You have a big piece of couscous in your teeth.
OTHERMALE:Can't you be serious for a minute? I just opened up to you.
OTHERMALE:- Can't you tell me how you feel? - Oh, you already know that.
LEADMALE:- I'd like to hear it.
LEADMALE:- I'm sure you would.
LEADFEMALE:Probably right now, maybe? Oh, okay, just give me a micro-bleam here.
SUPMALE:It's just a Shelf! - Shelf? - That's it, Mind.
OTHERMALE:This old man, he plays 12 He hits knick-knack on my shelf All right, that's it.
LEADMALE:Just forget it.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, who is not communicating now, Miss Marshall McLuhan? Well, what's the point in communicating with someone - who's got nothing to say? - Oh, maybe I would if I wasn't being interrogated by the Boulder Gestapo.
LEADFEMALE:- Gestapo? - Yeah, and I haven't even started yet.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you've got a lot of nerve calling me names, space boy.
OTHERMALE:Oh, to the moon, Alice! Well, I've got something I'd like to say to you.
LEADFEMALE:Shiksa! Oh, if you think Oh, Mind? I've cooled off now, hon.
SUPMALE:I'm really cooled off now, hon, because I'm locked out.
SUPMALE:Honey? Little pooterama? Ha-ha-ha.
SUPMALE:Fun's fun, hon.
LEADFEMALE:The bed's not gonna be as warm.
LEADMALE:Be careful.
SUPFEMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, couple more steps.
SUPFEMALE:Watch out there.
LEADFEMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:You look like you're on What's My Line? Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, that's all right.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, take one step up.
LEADMALE:Take a step up.
LEADFEMALE:There we go, one step up.
LEADMALE:Now, when you open your eyes, you're not gonna be mad at me anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? Well, we'd better be in Paris.
LEADMALE:Well, take one step forward, two steps to the left, and you're gonna be at the greatest place on earth, next to Burt Reynolds' Dinner Theatre in Jupiter, Florida.
LEADMALE:- Where are we? - Come on, Mind, what are you, blind? Oh.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:Boy, Mind, how about this for a blast from the past, huh? Well, don't you know where we are? Well, wait.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, imagine there are no walls here, the snow has melted, and there are beer cans over there - shimmering in the full moon.
OTHERFEMALE:- Mork, where are we? All right, I'll give you another hint.
LEADMALE:Sounds like the place we first met.
SUPMALE:- Here? - No, no, here.
LEADFEMALE:There was a rock that says, "Chi-Chi Loves Lumpy.
LEADMALE:" - Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, now I remember.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You had your suit on backwards.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I almost choked to death trying to tie the tie.
LEADFEMALE:- Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you were a priest.
SUPFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I was just glad that your mouth was on your face.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, I feel a sudden flood of emotions.
LEADMALE:I feel just like a salmon.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Why don't you take a picture? It lasts longer.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? Yo! Yaddy-yaddy-yadda.
LEADFEMALE:- Roofers.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:Mork, thanks for the sentimental journey to the past, but let's go home.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, we can't leave.
OTHERMALE:I mean, it's too important.
LEADMALE:We don't wanna end up like the League of Nations.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you can't honestly believe that just by coming back to a place like this, - it can change anything.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, yes, I do.
SUPMALE:Knock it off, for crying out loud! Show some decorum around here.
LEADMALE:Shut up! I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really sorry, folks.
LEADFEMALE:Please, I apologize.
LEADMALE:Try to excuse the fellas.
LEADMALE:It's just that they're not romantics, you know, like myself.
LEADFEMALE:Just last week, I, uh I bought my wife a cappuccino machine.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we didn't mean to barge in.
LEADMALE:In fact, we were just leaving.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're not the couple that's buying this place? - No.
SUPFEMALE:- On her salary? Are you kidding? Heh.
LEADMALE:Arg, arg.
LEADMALE:Looky-loos, huh? No, actually, this is the place where we first met when it was all still wilderness.
LEADFEMALE:- Really? - Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:- But we are just gonna be on our way.
LEADFEMALE:- Leave? No! You can't leave now and ruin this beautiful warm moment.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:I won't hear of it.
SUPMALE:But we do have a little bit of an insurance problem here.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Luke, give me a couple of hard hats down here.
SUPFEMALE:One for you, pal.
LEADMALE:There we go.
OTHERFEMALE:One for the lady.
LEADMALE:Mam'selle, here you are.
LEADFEMALE:I might say you look divine in green.
LEADFEMALE:Come on now, tell me, how did you two meet? Oh, well, you know, typical stuff, boy meets girl Come on, you can tell me.
LEADFEMALE:We're like old friends now.
SUPFEMALE:- No, I don't wanna.
SUPFEMALE:It's dumb.
LEADMALE:- No, it's not, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you see, she was out with this creep and then he dumped her - and he took off in her jeep.
SUPFEMALE:- That's not true.
SUPMALE:He I happened to dump him.
OTHERFEMALE:He just took my jeep.
LEADFEMALE:See, that's the part where I came in.
LEADFEMALE:I was sent to Earth to observe, and my eggship landed, well, about 40 feet over there.
LEADFEMALE:Then I came out with my suit on backwards and I said: And then I met her and, you know, then we started living together and we recently got married and a month ago my son was just hatched.
LEADMALE:- Oh-ho-ho.
LEADFEMALE:- That's nothing.
LEADMALE:You wanna hear a real story? I just wanna tell you how I first met Mitzi.
LEADMALE:All right? I was at Petaluma, right? You know, for the arm-wrestling tournaments.
LEADFEMALE:Turned around one day and there she was, Mitzi.
LEADMALE:Like a vision, like a Venus de Milo in a Harley-Davidson T-shirt.
SUPFEMALE:And she pinned that other chick in five seconds flat.
LEADMALE:Broke her wrist.
SUPMALE:Heh.
SUPFEMALE:That's a beautiful story.
LEADFEMALE:Sure beats the sap out of mine.
OTHERFEMALE:I gotta get back to work.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, you kids stay here as long as you want.
LEADMALE:You understand? You know, enjoy yourself.
LEADMALE:Okay, bye.
LEADFEMALE:I might just go two out of three with Mitzi tonight.
LEADFEMALE:She'll let me win.
OTHERMALE:She always does.
SUPMALE:She's crazy about me.
OTHERMALE:Well, who wouldn't be? Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:How could you tell a total stranger where you're really from? Oh, Mind, loose-lips moi.
OTHERMALE:I'm so muddled and confused recently, I feel like a Vietnamese child adopted by a Southern family.
LEADMALE:I know, I've been feeling badly too.
SUPMALE:I just can't seem to make things get together for us, Mind.
LEADMALE:I mean, what am I doing wrong? I don't know, Mork.
LEADMALE:If I did, I'd tell you.
SUPMALE:You know how to do origami and you don't know how to do this? I wonder what makes it so hard.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you think about it, it was never easy.
OTHERMALE:I mean, once you shrunk to the size of a beer nut.
LEADMALE:I've been cloned, and on our wedding day, Orson turned you into a dog.
LEADMALE:We've been through almost as much as Loretta Lynn before her sweet 16 party.
LEADFEMALE:If we can get through that, why can't we get through this? I don't know.
LEADMALE:It seems like since we've gotten married, everything seems so much more important.
SUPMALE:- Even our failures.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, Mind, we're not failing.
OTHERMALE:I know what failure means.
LEADFEMALE:I tried to argue with the phone company about a bill once.
OTHERFEMALE:You ever been on hold for a day? Well, I guess we can't expect to know all the answers.
LEADMALE:Just because we're married, we think we're supposed to.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:When I thought we were gonna be alone again, boy, did I panic.
LEADMALE:I know, but at least you tried.
LEADMALE:I just pushed.
LEADFEMALE:I got so uncomfortable.
LEADFEMALE:I kept trying to make you say things I wanted to hear.
SUPMALE:- That isn't us.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:But this is us, isn't it, huh? Oh, Mork, we've got so much going for us.
OTHERFEMALE:We don't need to have exotic dinners or pull crazy stunts to prove that we love each other.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I guess you're right, Mind.
SUPMALE:Eh.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:Won't be needing these.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, there we go.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, I love you.
LEADMALE:Oh, I love you too, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:And now I finally can say why.
SUPFEMALE:And you look great naked! - Thank you.
LEADMALE:- Oh, now, Mind, you know, relating has its place, but you know what's really nice? Well, it's to sit here, hold hands, - watch the sun set over the wet bar.
SUPMALE:- Heh-heh.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
SUPMALE:Come on, kiss her already.
LEADFEMALE:It's almost Miller time! Aw! 
SUPFEMALE:Na-no, na-no.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess that's all the time we have for today.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to thank my guests, Mary Snyder, the author of the best-seller I Bet You'll Ban Nuclear Energy After Your Hair and Teeth Fall Out, and also our local Rubik's Cube expert, Tommy Nesbitt.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Tommy, it's been a wonderful week.
LEADMALE:And as Wake Up, Boulder completes its first week on the air, I'd like to thank someone who exhibited a great deal of faith in this program and in my career, our general manager Miles Sternhagen.
LEADFEMALE:And so this is Mindy McConnell signing off for now, wishing you blue skies and green lights.
LEADFEMALE:Don't just sit there, shake hands.
LEADFEMALE:Pretend you just heard something funny.
LEADFEMALE:And we're out.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it was nice of you to say all those things about Sternhagen.
OTHERMALE:I'm sure it'll be a real comfort to him.
LEADFEMALE:Why? What's wrong? Is he sick? This show ought to be called Wake Up, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:- Sternhagen's out, he's been axed.
OTHERMALE:- You're kidding! No, we got us a new boss.
OTHERFEMALE:So you just polished the wrong guy's apple.
SUPFEMALE:He's such a jerk.
SUPFEMALE:I did it! Turn on the cameras! I'm finished! Yeah? You're not the only one.
SUPFEMALE:All aboard for the McConnell Express, now leaving for Anaheim, Azusa and Cucamonga.
LEADMALE:Oh, Pops, it's perfect in every detail.
SUPFEMALE:Look at that.
SUPMALE:Little people, little horses.
OTHERFEMALE:All you're missing is a robber baron and exploited Chinese labor going, "I got to get to San Francisco.
OTHERFEMALE:" Daddy, Daddy, can I be the engineer? Can I, can I, can I? Mearth Mearth, I think you just better watch me for a while so you can get the hang of it.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I gave these trains to Mindy over 20 years ago, but she wasn't interested in any toy that didn't cry or wet or have a best friend named Midge.
LEADFEMALE:You know something, Grandpops? That was a very moving, nostalgic speech.
LEADMALE:Now, fork over the controls! Oh, no! What a bummer! Oh.
SUPMALE:Hey, Mearth, it's okay.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mearth, Mearth, it's all right.
LEADMALE:It's just a few loose connections on the transformer.
LEADMALE:It's old and it doesn't work very well.
LEADMALE:You understand, son, like the Nielsen ratings.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:You'll never guess what happened.
LEADMALE:- They fired Sternhagen.
SUPMALE:- Hi, hon.
SUPFEMALE:Big kiss.
LEADFEMALE:Hold it! Come on now, fork over those controls! Put all the coal in the bag and start shoveling the money in the fire.
LEADMALE:Stop that, Daddy! Stop it.
LEADFEMALE:We're playing trains, and I'm brand-new to this.
LEADFEMALE:You mustn't be a robber all the time and do that.
LEADMALE:Come on, let me get used to playing with the train.
SUPMALE:Come on now.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, son, you had your chance and you blew it really big.
OTHERMALE:- Now, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:- Hey, is anybody listening to me? I mean, I think my career is more important than playing with trains.
LEADMALE:Mind, the 5:15's coming down the line.
LEADFEMALE:If no one throws the switch, Zeke's not gonna get his mail-order bride named Gilda.
LEADFEMALE:Will you turn that thing off just for a minute? Uh, we're sorry, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:You're absolutely right.
LEADFEMALE:Tell us what happened.
LEADFEMALE:Right, Mork? Of course.
LEADFEMALE:I should be the dutiful husband.
SUPMALE:Besides, Zeke sent her a phony picture anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Mommy, I'd really like to help you, but my hands are tied because I have to experience this railroad stuff.
LEADMALE:I understand, sweetheart.
OTHERFEMALE:Anyway, they fired Sternhagen.
LEADFEMALE:They just tossed him out on his heel without a word.
SUPFEMALE:Is there nothing sacred? First The Ropers, now Miles Sternhagen.
LEADMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:See, Sternhagen hired me.
LEADMALE:I mean, he gave me my shot at my own show.
LEADMALE:Now I don't know what's gonna happen.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, you're very good.
SUPFEMALE:What you do on your own is very good.
SUPMALE:You'll be just fine without him.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth, don't you tie that little family to the tracks! Oh, come on! Are you kidding, Grandpops? They're only rubber.
SUPMALE:Oh, come here, my little breadwinner.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:You're upset.
LEADFEMALE:You have to remember that the darkest is always about 3 a.
LEADMALE:m.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but, Mork, if you'd heard the plug I gave Sternhagen on the air today.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, if the new boss heard it, I could lose my job.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, that could be a problem.
LEADMALE:If you're out of work, I mean, who's gonna pay for the food, the rent, the bills, and those little smoke pellets for the engine over there? - All aboard! Head them up! - Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:The way I see it, if you work hard and do a good job, - they'll always keep you around.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, yeah, you're right.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm really not that worried.
SUPMALE:How's my hair? Do I have on too much lip gloss? - No, you look fine.
LEADFEMALE:- Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, what are you so uptight about? So this guy Pierson is a hotshot with a published thesis on programming.
LEADMALE:He's barely out of college.
OTHERMALE:And besides, I'm safe in sportscasting.
LEADMALE:There's always a stink when they fire a minority.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm really not that insecure.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, after all, Boulder does have to wake up in the morning, right? But not with you.
LEADMALE:Ahem.
LEADFEMALE:Here comes our new boss.
OTHERMALE:The one wearing the retainer.
OTHERFEMALE:That's Pierson? He looks more like the general manager of a McDonald's.
LEADFEMALE:- I think he's kind of cute.
SUPMALE:- Who cares? You know how I've lasted so long? I've always kept my self-respect.
LEADFEMALE:Never kowtowed to any of them.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:How do you do there, Mr.
LEADMALE:Pierson? Jake Loomis, cameraman.
LEADMALE:- Pleasure.
LEADMALE:- Yeah, nice suit there.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I've been with the station for 29 years now.
LEADFEMALE:I've got all the inside dirt on everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Jake, in all the world there's nothing sadder than an old fink.
LEADFEMALE:- You're fired.
SUPMALE:- Oh, fine, great.
LEADMALE:Well, let me tell you.
SUPFEMALE:You're gonna meet the same people on your way down as you did on your way up! Sonny! Poor Jake.
LEADFEMALE:I feel sorry for him.
LEADMALE:- And I don't even like him.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah, me too.
SUPFEMALE:I wonder if I can get his parking space.
OTHERFEMALE:May I have your attention, please? Thank you.
SUPMALE:I am Daniel Pierson, your new general manager.
SUPFEMALE:Now, first of all, I would like to put an end to the rumor that people are going to be fired.
LEADFEMALE:That is not a rumor.
LEADFEMALE:That is a fact.
LEADFEMALE:Tonight, I am planning an informal but mandatory get-together here at the station, to share some of my ideas and get to know your families better.
LEADMALE:So I want to make KTNS the place to be.
SUPMALE:At least, for some of us.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, let's all try to keep in touch, okay? - Sure, Mindy.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Pierson.
LEADFEMALE:Stan Jackson, sports at 6 and 10.
LEADMALE:- Pleasure.
LEADMALE:- Ooh, hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:What a grip you got there.
SUPMALE:You know, you'd look great in a Broncos jacket.
LEADMALE:Oh, there's something I'd like to remind you of, I'm black.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, I'm Judi, your weather person.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to welcome you with a big KTNS warm front.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:How sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:She's very sweet.
LEADMALE:There's more where that came from.
LEADFEMALE:Mind.
LEADMALE:Mind, Mind, am I glad I caught up with you, hon.
LEADFEMALE:Hon, I've got an important telegram from a major news network in New York.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork, don't do this to me.
LEADMALE:- Read it, hon? I have to sing it! Five, six, seven, eight.
LEADFEMALE:We're looking for a newscaster One who speaks quite well And who doesn't wear a toupee Like Howard Cosell And if you've been through college Please join our team Signed Roone Arledge Mindy, is your parking space any closer than Jake's? Mr.
SUPMALE:Pierson, that was just a little joke.

LEADMALE:He was just kidding around.
SUPMALE:He's a little nervous about my job.

LEADMALE:- Oh, Mindy, please, don't apologize.
OTHERMALE:I want you to know that I appreciate family concern.
LEADMALE:Well, just this morning my mom called me to make sure that I had dressed warm.

OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, I will.

SUPMALE:- Think again.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.

LEADFEMALE:Daddy, come in here, please, and make it work.
SUPFEMALE:Please.

OTHERFEMALE:If you wanna see my face, see this.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, little bulldog boy, no! - Aargh.
LEADMALE:Come on now, I'll fix the trains and I'll make them run better than Mussolini ever did, now come on.

SUPFEMALE:Oh, shucks, son.
SUPMALE:Let's play this one together.
LEADFEMALE:Ready? - Daddy? - Yes, son? Why am I talking to you and looking at me? Holy shazbot! Wait, don't panic.
SUPMALE:There's an explanation for this.
LEADFEMALE:There's always an explanation for everything.
SUPMALE:The only thing I can't explain is this.
LEADFEMALE:Why is it that Bob Hope is still doing commercials? Everything was fine until Don't do that.
SUPMALE:- Hey, Mork, are you there? - I'll go.
OTHERFEMALE:Can you open the door? My hands are full.

LEADMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Big kiss, big kiss.

LEADFEMALE:Oh, you stoolie.
LEADFEMALE:Crossed minds.
SUPMALE:I got a little taller, huh? Right? Did I do good? Why me? You transferred minds through a train set? This is like a bad horror movie, only I'm married to the mad scientist.
LEADMALE:Mind, wrong body.
SUPMALE:I'm over here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, right.
SUPFEMALE:- Um, well, how long is this gonna last? - I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe 24 hours, We gotta get to that party where they have little crackers.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:- Mearth, look - Yes, Mommy.
SUPMALE:Um Mearth, go upstairs to your bedroom while your father and I have a little talk.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:So that's the way it is.
LEADFEMALE:He's in and I'm out.
LEADFEMALE:You've asked for it once again, Butchie returns.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you something, son, once and for all.
LEADMALE:Don't do that.
LEADMALE:Your face will freeze.
LEADFEMALE:No! No.
LEADFEMALE:Who cares? Who cares anyway? It's not my body.
LEADMALE:Ooh, you're a joke! I'm hip.
LEADFEMALE:- Okay, okay, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:- Mork, sit down.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm ready, ready, kay-o.
SUPMALE:Kay-o, kay-o.
LEADMALE:Going to the party.
LEADFEMALE:It's late, and we ought to get to the party - as soon as we can, that's all.
SUPMALE:- Go to the party? Mork, I can't take you to the party with that face.
SUPFEMALE:Little pooter.
LEADMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind.
LEADMALE:About this face, I wanna make something clear, just as clear as your complexion.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? Chances are the boss is gonna come over to look at Mork, right? Then take my body, please.
LEADMALE:My job is hanging by a thread as it is.
LEADFEMALE:I can't take Mearth to the party.
SUPMALE:He's just a child.
LEADMALE:That's true, but I'll tell you something.
LEADFEMALE:He's half a superior being, remember that? He'll be almost as good as I would have been.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I'm afraid of.
OTHERFEMALE:Call this a party? Where's the cake and the little party hats and the pushy father with the camera going, "Stay by the bull, stay by the bull"? No! Mork Mearth.
LEADMALE:Mearth, remember, my job is at stake.
LEADFEMALE:Now remember our agreement.
LEADMALE:If you're a good boy and you don't embarrass Mommy, then I'll give you that note to get out of gym.
SUPMALE:- I'll try and act like an adult, Mommy.
SUPMALE:- Okay.
LEADMALE:Good boy.
LEADFEMALE:I think Mommy should do all the talking, so shh.
SUPMALE:Jake.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm glad to see you're back.
SUPFEMALE:Stuffed mushroom, Mindy? Boy, are you older than dirt.
LEADMALE:Give me a break.
LEADMALE:Ain't I had enough for one day? Uh, no, thank you, but I'm glad to see you're working again.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, this is just temporary.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna ask Pierson for my job back tonight.
LEADFEMALE:If he says no, I'm gonna kill him.
LEADMALE:Good evening, everyone! Hey, thanks for coming.
SUPMALE:And now, I would like to introduce you to the future of KTNS.
SUPFEMALE:Ju Ju.
OTHERMALE:Now, this is our morning schedule.
LEADFEMALE:You will notice that the only major change is the removal of Wake Up, Boulder and Kartoon Karnival in place of our morning movie.
OTHERFEMALE:So, Mindy, Skipper Bill, you're out.
OTHERMALE:Don't worry, Mindy, he's dead.
SUPMALE:Now, I am planning a powerhouse opening for the new season.
LEADMALE:To kick off the Monday movie, you can look forward to Ben Gazzara week.
LEADFEMALE:So let's all pull together and make KTNS the biggest little independent station in Boulder.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Pierson, I think you've made a mistake.
OTHERFEMALE:And I'm not just saying this because I am the host of the show, but I really believe that Wake Up, Boulder is an important, vital program and really performs a service to this community.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Mindy, it's essential that you know that what I've done has nothing to do with you personally.
LEADMALE:- It is strict economics.
LEADFEMALE:- Well - You know, I like the Road Runner.
SUPMALE:- Excuse me? - Not now, not now.
LEADMALE:- No, no, Mindy, let him talk.
OTHERMALE:I like to hear what the general public has to say.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, maybe not.
SUPFEMALE:Heh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I like the way the Road Runner goes beep-beep.
SUPMALE:And then I go beep-beep.
SUPFEMALE:Are you saying that a grown man like yourself watches cartoons every morning? Yes, I've seen Popeye 14 times.
LEADMALE:And if you run it backwards, it has an ending.
SUPFEMALE:But, you know basically, what I really like is, like, when the coyote paints a tunnel on the side of a mountain and then the Road Runner just goes, vroom, right through the tunnel and then when the coyote tries to go through, vroom, boom, he becomes two-dimensional.
LEADFEMALE:I think I think what Mork is trying to say is that he appreciates an altered sense of reality.
LEADMALE:You know, something that contrasts the drabness of everyday life.
LEADMALE:I knew that.
OTHERFEMALE:However, Mindy, I want you to know that my morning movie will accomplish the very same thing.
LEADMALE:Bummer, this is not real.
LEADFEMALE:What does he mean by that? You don't know? Well, heh, of course I know.
LEADFEMALE:It's just a simple, um, metaphorical approach to saying that movies can only simulate reality, while cartoons, by virtue of their being so totally unreal, create their own level of reality, so therefore, ergo, it only follows that all that which is real is that which is completely unreal.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I think I touched on that in my thesis.
LEADMALE:Oh, those are real.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's brilliant! Reality is direct personal experience.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mindy, I had no idea that your husband was so perceptive about our medium.
SUPFEMALE:Neither did I.
LEADMALE:Heh.
SUPMALE:I want more, though.
LEADMALE:I'm still hungry.
LEADFEMALE:- Mm.
LEADMALE:Of course, you're still hungry.
OTHERFEMALE:- Unfulfilled.
SUPFEMALE:- Mm, unfulfilled.
SUPMALE:- You got it.
LEADFEMALE:You are still hungry because TV menus are limited these days, which is why people are hungry for knowledge and the exchange of ideas.
LEADFEMALE:Right, Mindy? Right.
SUPMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:And it's up to our programming to be able to relay to the public information that will help feed that hunger.
OTHERFEMALE:Like a talk show! - What a great idea.
OTHERFEMALE:Hm-hm.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, something really different.
OTHERMALE:I will call it Wake No, I will call it I will call it Stop Sleeping, Boulder.
OTHERMALE:Finally, something good.
SUPMALE:Oh, it is, isn't it? Gosh, I love this business.
SUPMALE:Well, now, all I need is the perfect host to make it work.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh, look, pretty, right under my nose.
SUPFEMALE:Right again, Mork.
LEADMALE:What we need is someone who can exude intelligence, warmth and grace.
SUPMALE:- Mindy? - Yes.
LEADMALE:- Until we find somebody, you're it.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I've just created my first show.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha.
SUPMALE:Gosh, now I know how God and Norman Lear felt.
LEADMALE:- Mearth? - Mm? You are an amazing little boy.
SUPFEMALE:You got Mommy back her job.
LEADMALE:At least temporarily.
LEADMALE:- I'm very proud of you, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:- Thank you, Mommy.
SUPFEMALE:But can we go home right now? Daddy's shorts are really riding up on me.
LEADMALE:I'm talking major snuggy here.
LEADMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Fire one.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, Mearth I mean Mork, are you sure this reverse energy process will work? Well, as they say in French: - Maybe.
LEADMALE:- Well, now, let's just keep a positive attitude.
LEADMALE:I mean, it always worked in Frankenstein.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, I know this hasn't been easy for you, - but at least you got your show back.
SUPMALE:- Yeah, that's true.
LEADMALE:Actually, Pierson turned out not to be such a bad kid after all.
SUPFEMALE:He even gave Jake his job back, after the bomb squad left.
SUPFEMALE:I was glad to use your body.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry I didn't wash it before I gave it back to you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, here goes.
OTHERMALE:Oh, great, Dad! Great.
LEADMALE:You should work for the Defense Department.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, no, no.
SUPMALE:Look, you just You forgot to plug it in.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh.
SUPMALE:Little pooter, I'm back.
LEADMALE:- Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Come here.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Well, everything is back to normal again.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm certainly happy for you kids.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess I'd better get Get off to rehearsal.
LEADFEMALE:Major bummer.
OTHERFEMALE:This is worse.
SUPMALE:Now I'm bald.
OTHERFEMALE:Look out.
SUPMALE:Here comes the face.
LEADMALE:Mind, now come on, don't worry.
LEADMALE:We'll switch them back, and after that, maybe you and I can switch.
LEADFEMALE:I've always wanted to be whistled at by construction workers.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! 
LEADMALE:Na-no, na-no.
LEADMALE:Hi, I'm home.
LEADMALE:Ah, Mork, Mearth, I'm home from work.
LEADMALE:What a day.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, you keep your coat on, Mind, because if we really haul rubber right now, we can get downtown, we can go to the grocery store, the hardware store.
LEADFEMALE:I've saved up enough coupons to buy a small Learjet.
SUPFEMALE:Now, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, I just got home from work.
SUPMALE:I don't wanna run out the door again.
SUPMALE:Come on, there's gotta be something in this house we can eat.
LEADMALE:Oh, we just have that cheese that the president sent us.
LEADMALE:Mearth, Mearth, come on, son.
LEADMALE:Move it, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:I'm moving.
LEADMALE:My clothes are standing still.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:I know you're in there somewhere.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Neat.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, listen, Mommy, can you get someplace where there's air conditioning? Sweetheart.
SUPMALE:Just give me a minute to catch my breath, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:I just walked in the door.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hon.
LEADMALE:Now, poor little, pooped-out pooter, don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, you just sit down here and we'll make you feel so much better.
SUPMALE:- Mm-hm.
OTHERMALE:- That's nice.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:- Now we feel better, don't we? - Mm-hm.
LEADMALE:Mm, good.
LEADFEMALE:Now let's haul tush.
LEADMALE:Come on, let's go.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, every time I come home, I've gotta turn around and run out the door again.
LEADMALE:There's gotta be some way you can handle these errands during the day.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind, it's not that easy.
LEADFEMALE:- Well - It isn't.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, you guys, are you gonna go or aren't you? - No.
SUPMALE:- Yes.
LEADMALE:Are you or aren't you? You know, I tell you something both.
LEADMALE:I'm beginning to sweat as much as Orson Welles chasing a Frisbee.
OTHERMALE:Right, we forgot about you under there.
LEADFEMALE:Here, let me help you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Daddy sure kept you warm, didn't he? I don't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:I feel, Mommy, like a Some kind of huge artichoke and it's just You're de-leafing me.
LEADFEMALE:Or debriefing me.
LEADMALE:Whichever.
LEADMALE:Mork, you know it would be a lot easier for all of us if you would learn how to drive.
LEADFEMALE:You want me to drive some primitive vehicle financed by the government? Come on now.
SUPMALE:Mind, it'd be like asking the great Pelé to play soccer with a bee-bee.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, look at it this way.
LEADFEMALE:What if something happened to Mearth during the day, like a real emergency, what would you do? Well, I'd do what I always do, fall apart.
LEADMALE:Wouldn't it be a lot simpler if you learned how to drive a car? I mean, really, Mork, it's a snap.
SUPFEMALE:Like in some parts of the country, you can get your license at 14.
SUPMALE:Oh, the same parts of the country where they marry at 8.
LEADMALE:Listen, you two, I'm gonna tell you something, gently.
SUPFEMALE:I've had it right up to say here.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? I'm going into the bedroom.
LEADMALE:If I'm not called for dinner within an hour, remember this, I can get awfully cranky.
LEADMALE:Think about it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, have it your way.
SUPMALE:But I'll tell you, I think it's a shame.
OTHERMALE:If you had your license, just think, you could drive those 6 long miles to the arcade and play "Pac-Man.
LEADFEMALE:" But if you wanna stand on the curb sniffing at life's exhaust, that's your prerogative.
SUPMALE:- I'm Stirling Moss.
LEADMALE:- And I'll be Jackie Stewart.
OTHERMALE:Great, great, great.
OTHERFEMALE:Gonna be great today.
SUPMALE:There we go.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I forgot to start mine.
SUPFEMALE:How silly.
LEADMALE:Don't touch the automobile.
OTHERMALE:It'll be cursed.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I forgot to wear my goggles.
LEADFEMALE:These flies are hitting my eyes.
OTHERMALE:All right, enough's enough.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:All right, now, Mearth, Mommy's gonna ask you to do a big favor, and that's help me teach Daddy how to drive, okay? And that means, shh, be quiet.
LEADMALE:That's great.
LEADMALE:- Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:- You pay attention.
LEADMALE:Okay, now My understanding was, that this was gonna be a lot of family fun.
LEADMALE:Well, no, Mearth, we're not on a family trip.
LEADMALE:We're just gonna sit in the car.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then we're very much overly packed.
SUPMALE:Okay, Mork.
OTHERMALE:Now You gave it to me.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:You've seen me drive before, all right? - Mommy.
SUPMALE:- Hm? Are we there yet? Sweetheart, I told you, we're not going anywhere.
LEADMALE:We're sitting in the garage.
LEADFEMALE:But why don't you pretend we're going on a family trip, okay? Okay.
SUPFEMALE:But that's what I mean.
LEADFEMALE:Are we there yet? Almost.
LEADFEMALE:Ready? All right, now, this is the ignition.
LEADMALE:To start the engine, you put your key in and turn it.
LEADMALE:Key.
LEADFEMALE:That means I'll need a key chain.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, that's wonderful, because maybe I can get one with a cowboy boot on the end.
OTHERFEMALE:Or one with a piece of Tupperware, or one with a bagel that says: "Nosh, nosh, who's there?" Mork, forget the key chain, it's not important, okay? Are you kidding, Mind? Style is everything to me.
LEADMALE:Okay, back on the track.
SUPFEMALE:Now, this is a standard transmission.
OTHERFEMALE:That means you have to change the gears by using the gearshift.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, so that's what that's for.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:What'd you think it was for, churning butter? It doesn't really matter what I thought.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Okay, now, what you do to do that, you take your foot off the gas and depress the clutch.
LEADMALE:Depress the clutch.
LEADMALE:Clutch, have you ever seen the movie Brian's Song? How about that last Ali fight, huh? Mommy, Mommy.
LEADMALE:- What, Mearth? - Mommy, I'm getting car sick.
OTHERMALE:- No.
LEADFEMALE:- I am, I am, I am.
LEADFEMALE:You know, sweetheart, so am I.
LEADMALE:You know, I have come to the realization that I don't have the ability to teach you how to drive.
OTHERMALE:In fact, I know for sure I don't have the patience.
LEADMALE:I think you should go to a driving school.
OTHERMALE:- Does that mean the lesson's over? - Yes.
LEADMALE:- You know what that means, son? - Yes, I do.
SUPMALE:Back to the Grand Prix, eh? Oh, what a day Let me say When you drive in your way You can say No, I'm not coming into the pits now! I'm not coming into the pits! No, don't touch my arm! - Aah! - Oh, let my arm go! Let my arm! - They got my arm! He's got my arm! - What is? Forget that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, let it alone! Agh! Oh, the police are following us.
LEADMALE:- There's the queen.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, well, hello.
LEADMALE:- The regular queen.
LEADFEMALE:- Hello, hello, hello.
SUPMALE:Hello, queen.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha! As I live and breathe, Todd Norman Taylor.
LEADMALE:TNT, that's my initials and my lifestyle, a megaton of fun and a pretty fair limbo dancer.
SUPFEMALE:Ow! Hey, where's my hug? We're a couple of today guys, aren't we, huh? No macho hang-ups.
OTHERMALE:How I missed you.
SUPMALE:I wish we could share something shallow, but my driving instructor's on the way over.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Well, time's up.
SUPMALE:Oh, huzzah, huzzah, boom-bah! Whoa, for sure, totally gnarly.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:I gotta show you something.
LEADFEMALE:I've already picked out my bumper sticker.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this.
LEADFEMALE:"Aliens make better lovers.
SUPMALE:" And look at this one here.
SUPMALE:It says, "Horn if you're a honky.
LEADMALE:" That's real trendy, Mork, real cute.
SUPFEMALE:Heh.
SUPMALE:But if you're gonna be king of the road, you're gonna have to get serious.
SUPFEMALE:A lot of things you're gonna have to learn.
LEADMALE:For example, you know where to stash your Binaca? No.
LEADMALE:You know how to drive with your wrist? More important, do you know how to look cool when a lit cigarette falls between your legs? Teach me, O guru of the gearshift, my motor mentor.
SUPFEMALE:Numero uno.
SUPMALE:No matter how treacherous the road conditions, always, always stop for female hitchhikers.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm married.
SUPMALE:Married? Ugh! The ultimate social disease.
SUPMALE:Sorry, I didn't know.
SUPFEMALE:That's all right, you still have a year to pick out our wedding gift.
OTHERFEMALE:If you're not out cruising for skirts, why do you wanna learn how to drive? If cars didn't turn on women, you wouldn't catch me in those death traps for all the musk oil in Cleveland.
LEADMALE:Heh, heh.
OTHERFEMALE:Death trap? As in: death trap? Oh, man, no.
LEADMALE:Come on, if it's that bad, why are you a driving instructor? Teenage girls with learner's permits.
OTHERMALE:I got the boss jacket for free.
LEADFEMALE:Come on now, you I mean, you gotta be kidding there.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it's not really that bad, is it? It's not dangerous.
SUPMALE:Dangerous? Mork-o, it's slaughter alley out there.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you ever watch CHiPs? How'd you like to get Rolfed by 3 tons of cold, hard steel, huh? You're right.
OTHERMALE:I'll just have to drive like a senior citizen looking for an address.
SUPFEMALE:Go by me, go by me.
LEADMALE:Well, that's real good, except then you'll be a real easy target.
OTHERFEMALE:Those people are out looking for blood.
OTHERFEMALE:But, hey, take the Zen view.
LEADMALE:You can only have one fatal accident.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No! No! - Mork.
SUPMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:- Aah! Wake up.
LEADMALE:You're just having a nightmare, and you're off key.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mind, it was a real nightmare.
OTHERFEMALE:It was worse than that dream I had where I was trapped with the three seminary students and the animal therapist who kept saying, "Let the hamster have his space.
LEADMALE:" Oh, Mork, just relax.
LEADFEMALE:You're just having a bad dream.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody does.
LEADMALE:Just try to shake it off and think of something pleasant.
SUPFEMALE:Go back to sleep.
SUPFEMALE:You wanna be fresh for your test tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, Mind, I'm not taking that test tomorrow.
SUPMALE:No, no, no, this dream was a sign.
LEADMALE:It was a warning from beyond, Mind.
LEADMALE:I mean, I don't wanna end up as a subject of some pop-maudlin hit: We knew him well But he's windshield dust now Are you subtly trying to tell me you're not gonna take your driving test tomorrow? I'm just trying to tell you I'm never gonna get in a car again.
LEADMALE:Night, Mind.
LEADMALE:You sleep well.
OTHERFEMALE:Mind? Yes? What's this copy of Playgirl doing under here? Mork, look, why don't you just describe your dream to me and maybe I can help you analyze it, then you'll see there's nothing to be worried about.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, all right.
LEADFEMALE:- Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, I'll try.
OTHERMALE:Let me see now.
LEADMALE:It'll just take a moment to get into this.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I remember now, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I was on this road and it's very, very, very thick fog.
LEADFEMALE:I try to run, but I can't.
SUPFEMALE:I try to scream, but I can't.
SUPMALE:I try to rumba, I win second prize.
LEADFEMALE:What does this have to do with driving? What are you, a dream critic? Come on, honey.
LEADMALE:- And then Then it happened.
LEADFEMALE:- What? I felt this icy-cold hand touch me here, and it sent a chill down my spine.
LEADMALE:I look back.
LEADFEMALE:It was him.
LEADMALE:Who? It was Satan.
LEADMALE:The devil, Beelzebub.
OTHERFEMALE:Stop.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, I mean, it had to be him.
LEADMALE:I mean, how many men do you know that have little hooves? Oh, his eyes, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I remember his eyes.
LEADMALE:They were like a combination of Ming the Merciless and Nancy Reagan.
SUPFEMALE:And then he looked at me, and a long, bony finger pointed and said, "You're next.
SUPFEMALE:" I And then the next thing I remember, there I was, seat-belted into a hearse and there's no one driving, and the hearse is going down a long hill towards a tunnel, and I'm screaming, going, "No! No!" And the next thing you know, I'm in a beauty parlor having electrolysis.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, calm down.
LEADMALE:I mean, I think that, under the circumstances, what you're experiencing is perfectly normal.
LEADFEMALE:You mean everybody has dreams like that? Well, no.
LEADFEMALE:Well, yeah, sort of.
SUPFEMALE:But everybody is afraid of taking their driver's test.
LEADMALE:I know I sure was.
OTHERMALE:I was so scared.
LEADFEMALE:But I took it and I passed and I was so excited.
OTHERMALE:As a matter of fact, I remember the day I passed, my dad gave me the car.
OTHERMALE:And I went and picked up my girlfriends: Perchy and Mellat and Susie.
LEADFEMALE:And we went to the record store and bought the new Herman's Hermits album.
SUPMALE:Remember that? Anyway, so then we went to the A&W to celebrate, and I had an I had a root beer.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:No, Mellat had the root beer, I had a cherry Coke.
LEADMALE:We were trying to impress these guys in the other car.
SUPMALE:I was holding my cherry Coke like this and I poured it down the front of me.
LEADMALE:We tried to get napkins from the guy, but he didn't have any.
LEADMALE:- Mind, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah? I'll make you a deal.
LEADMALE:I'll take my driving test if you don't finish that story.
SUPFEMALE:I can take a hint.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, it's a deal.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Mind? What? Are you mad at me? Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, kind of, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you cut me off.
OTHERMALE:You cut me off like you did that time we went to the grocery store and I was trying to make spaghetti, remember that? And we were buying all the No, no, I was making meat loaf.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, I was buying the tomato sauce and the onions and Well, other people like my stories.
OTHERFEMALE:I did it.
SUPFEMALE:I did it.
LEADMALE:- I did, did, did it, hey! - I did, did, did it, hey! Well, I hate to rain on your parade, but that was just the eye test.
OTHERMALE:You mean there's more? Never fear, TNT is here, guiding you from gear to gear.
LEADFEMALE:Check.
SUPMALE:How are you doing, TNT? - Hey, crazy lady.
LEADMALE:- Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Brought you a wedding present.
SUPFEMALE:You did? Oh, you didn't have to do that.
LEADMALE:Try to buy that in a store.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, thanks.
LEADMALE:It's returnable.
SUPMALE:Have you met our son? Uh, son? Sonny? - His name's Sonny.
LEADFEMALE:Sonny.
SUPMALE:- Sonny.
LEADMALE:Sorry to hear about you and Cher.
SUPMALE:Hoo! Whoa, I'm hot today.
SUPFEMALE:So you're TNT.
SUPMALE:Take these.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go, bye-bye.
OTHERMALE:Oh, TNT, I'm so glad you're here.
SUPMALE:Nothing stands between me and my personalized license plate.
OTHERMALE:How do you like this one? R-R-R.
LEADMALE:Get it? Mork 12.
LEADMALE:Boy, that'd be You're next.
OTHERFEMALE:- Mind, Mind, it's him.
SUPMALE:- Who? Beelzebub.
LEADFEMALE:He's no Try to avoid those garbage bags.
LEADMALE:Bear to the right.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that bad for the tires? Only two of them.
SUPMALE:Boy, that was great.
SUPMALE:- Did you do that on your driver's test? - No.
OTHERMALE:Would you try to avoid those parked cars? Parked cars? Aah! There were no parked cars in my dream.
SUPMALE:Shazbot! Mind.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Stop.
LEADFEMALE:I'm too virile to die.
LEADFEMALE:Please, Lord, get me out of this and I'll donate all my chains to Parents Without Partners.
SUPFEMALE:Another right turn, please.
LEADMALE:Sadist.
LEADMALE:Watch out! Get down! Get funky.
LEADFEMALE:I'm satisfied with your work on the test course.
LEADMALE:I think it's time for the highway section of the test.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha! It's him! It's him! Mindy, anybody.
LEADFEMALE:Mayday.
SUPFEMALE:Mayday.
OTHERMALE:Now I know how Ed Sullivan felt.
LEADMALE:Kiss me good night, Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, Daddy, I was just thinking, maybe I could fix you a nice, big, hot cup of cocoa with a marshmallow in it and maybe a goldfish sandwich.
LEADMALE:- Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:- I know, no mustard.
SUPMALE:Oh, isn't that sweet of him, Mind? Unlike you who tried to send me to my doom.
LEADFEMALE:He's turning on us.
OTHERFEMALE:Mearth, why don't you go up to your room so Dad and I can have a talk? Okay, okay.
LEADFEMALE:I tell you what, I think you should maybe rub him on the tummy like this.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I always do with Teddy.
OTHERMALE:Only with Teddy, when I rub him and keep rubbing, he never closes his eyes.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on, Mork, don't be so depressed.
LEADFEMALE:So you'll take the test another time.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, if I don't take it again, Mearth will think I'm a quitter.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, he might.
LEADMALE:- He'll think I'm a coward.
LEADMALE:- Maybe.
SUPMALE:- He'll lose all respect for me.
LEADMALE:- Possibly.
SUPMALE:I can live with that.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, so you failed your driving test.
SUPFEMALE:It's not the end of the world.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, easy for you to say, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I've never failed before.
OTHERMALE:I mean, now I'm an inferior superior being.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, Mind.
LEADMALE:I mean, even Richard Dawson wouldn't kiss me now.
SUPFEMALE:Sit down.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork.
SUPMALE:I might not have been able to help you learn to drive, but there is one thing I do know about, and that's failure.
LEADMALE:- See, there was this time - Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Are you gonna tell that spelling bee story again? Well, I was.
LEADMALE:All right, the simple truth is, Mork, I mean, everybody fails sometimes.
LEADMALE:Even Buddy Ebsen? Yeah, sure, probably.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, nobody's perfect.
OTHERMALE:I mean, sometimes you succeed and sometimes you don't.
SUPMALE:- That's what makes you human.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, I'm not a human, Mind.
OTHERMALE:All right, all right.
LEADMALE:What I'm trying to say is, just because you failed doesn't make you a failure.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but it still hurts.
LEADMALE:I know it does, sweetheart.
OTHERMALE:And the only way to prevent that hurt is to go back in there and try again.
OTHERMALE:Now, put everything behind you and think positive.
OTHERMALE:I know you can pass that test, so go in there and try it.
LEADMALE:You can do it.
LEADFEMALE:I know you can.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, I can.
LEADFEMALE:And you know what? I think I can.
LEADFEMALE:No, I really can.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I can.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna do it.
LEADFEMALE:I really am.
SUPMALE:But just in case, I'm gonna dress up as an old lady so they'll give me a break.
LEADFEMALE:That's the Mork I know.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Do me a favor.
SUPMALE:If we go someplace formal tonight, will you paint a tie on here? 
SUPFEMALE:No-no, na-no.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Your Oral Fixationship.
SUPMALE:Orson's gonna love this report.
OTHERMALE:Ha, ha.
OTHERMALE:No, he won't.
OTHERMALE:He's gonna hate it.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't get this report past a white defensive back.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, what do I say to him? Well, Orson will buy anything as long as I make him believe that he's thin for a very brief moment.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:All right, here goes nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERMALE:- Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:- Hi.
SUPFEMALE:- Ready to go? - Oh, not now, little pooter.
LEADMALE:I have to make my report to Orson.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You've had all week to do that.
OTHERFEMALE:I got off work early so we could take Mearth clothes shopping.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, talk to Orson later.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on now, Mind, he relies upon me to keep him aware of the late-breaking events and technological advancements and miraculous breakthroughs.
LEADMALE:Oh, what's your report on? Ants.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mearth, we're going.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mind, we can't go unless you write me another "Please excuse Mork" note.
LEADMALE:- Come on, Mork - Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.
LEADMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm so glad we're going.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, it's getting late.
SUPMALE:Let's go, let's go.
SUPMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Oh my gosh, let's go.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought kids were supposed to hate to go clothes shopping.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we'd have to drag him out of here kicking and screaming.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so did I.
LEADMALE:That's why I told him we were going to the circus.
OTHERMALE:This is a joke, and I'm the butt of it.
LEADMALE:Mearth, don't be Now, don't be like that.
LEADMALE:I think you look very handsome.
LEADMALE:- Doesn't he, Daddy? - Yes.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:What does he know? He promised to take me to the circus.
OTHERMALE:That's what your Mommy told me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, uh, sir.
LEADMALE:We're ready to be altered.
LEADMALE:Altered? Like Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Simmons' cat? I don't want him moping around the house all day and then laying on the TV.
SUPFEMALE:So, what do you think? That fits like a glove.
LEADMALE:You've gotta be You know, you can wear that home.
LEADMALE:You've gotta be putting me on.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, look at this.
SUPMALE:- The shoulders need to be taken in.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, sure, yeah, okay.
LEADMALE:And sleeves can go up.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, sleeves here? - Here? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:- The buttons can be moved over.
LEADMALE:- All right.
OTHERFEMALE:And, uh, don't forget to erase the chalk marks when you're done.
SUPFEMALE:She acts like she's your mother.
SUPFEMALE:She does, doesn't she? I can't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:Look at all these scribbly marks he put all over me.
SUPMALE:I feel like some kind of rotten subway.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know something? Mother's Day is coming up.
LEADFEMALE:I believe it's in May, and I just canceled your present.
LEADMALE:Mearth, I told you I told you we were going clothes shopping, and that's what we're doing, and that's final.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, how about a sailor suit? You can't go anywhere in a sailor suit.
OTHERMALE:Donald Duck does.
LEADMALE:He's right, Mind, and Donald Duck doesn't have to wear pants.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you see if they have any suspenders? You could use a pair.
LEADMALE:I don't need them now.
OTHERMALE:I'm waiting for Emmett Kelly's garage sale.
SUPMALE:Remember that tie I knitted you? I could make you a pair of suspenders to match.
SUPFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:It never hurts to browse.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Come with me.
LEADMALE:Morning.
OTHERMALE:I knew it.
SUPFEMALE:You can always tell by the part.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thank you for inviting me to your barbecue, sir, and I'll be right back.
SUPMALE:I think I forgot the potato salad.
SUPFEMALE:I'm tired of waiting for your report.
LEADMALE:Do you have it or did your neighbor's dog eat it again? Are you kidding, sir? Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Clutch with no report? Come on now, I had a real winner for you, but I decided to expand my perspective and go for a subject of broader scope.
SUPMALE:Sir.
LEADMALE:Sir, I'd tell it to you, but it's a little hard to articulate while I'm being roasted.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, sir.
LEADFEMALE:The report this week, sir, will make you laugh, it'll make you cry, it'll become part of you.
LEADFEMALE:Because today, I tied Mearth's shoes.
OTHERFEMALE:Where did I put my lighter? Come on now, have mercy.
LEADMALE:Listen, I know my reports recently have been about as interesting - as a PTA newsletter, but please - Silence! You're not fulfilling your mission on Earth.
LEADMALE:The scope of your reports is becoming alarmingly narrow.
LEADMALE:You've been letting your wife and son interfere with your responsibilities to Ork.
SUPMALE:I've had enough! You will eliminate all contact with your family unit.
LEADFEMALE:Come on now, sir, I can't.
SUPMALE:I mean, they need me.
SUPMALE:I'm head of the household, king of the castle.
SUPFEMALE:MC of the home version of Hollywood Squares.
OTHERFEMALE:From now on, Mork, concentrate on yourjob and put your family aside.
LEADMALE:Never, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, I can cope with being tied to a stake.
LEADMALE:I can cope with being burned.
SUPFEMALE:But I will never forget my family.
LEADFEMALE:Wanna bet? When I get done with you, the only thing you'll remember about Earth is not to stick a fork in the toaster.
SUPFEMALE:For sure, totally.
LEADMALE:For sure.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Boxing has been good to me, Howard.
LEADFEMALE:Aah, ow.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Greetings, I'm Mork from Ork, na-no.
LEADMALE:This may sound cliché but will you take me to your leader? Se habla Yiddish? That takes care of the suit, but to tell you the truth, I don't have the strength to go on for the shoes.
SUPMALE:Let's just call it a day, Mork, okay? How do you know my name, Earthling? Oh, give me a break.
SUPFEMALE:Can I just have the checkbook, please? I can't.
SUPMALE:Our planets don't have trade agreements, but will you take me to your leader? Are you putting me on? Oh, I can't.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid you wouldn't fit.
LEADMALE:Mork.
SUPMALE:The meanie tailor must have dropped at least 50 pins in my pants.
OTHERFEMALE:I feel like I've got prickly heat.
SUPMALE:Na-no, I'm Mork from Ork.
SUPMALE:Come on, Dad, I'm Mearth, your son.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, then I must be a moon.
LEADMALE:Aah.
LEADMALE:Mommy, has he been nipping on the ginger ale again? No, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:I think your dad is having a little memory problem.
LEADMALE:I think we better go home right now.
OTHERMALE:Okay, the suit will be ready in a couple of months, maybe.
LEADMALE:Will that be cash or a charge? - Oh, do you accept a charge? - Oh, gladly.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADMALE:Suit'll be ready on Tuesday, huh? - Come on.
SUPMALE:- But where are you taking me? - Home.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, but we just met.
LEADFEMALE:Shouldn't we have a drink first? I'll still respect you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Earth primitive.
LEADMALE:Just like a museum without the overpriced gift shop.
LEADMALE:- Now will you take me to your leader? - I keep telling you, you don't wanna meet our leader.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Mork, look around.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you recognize this place? I mean, you live here with me and Mearth.
OTHERMALE:- Who's Mearth? - Me, your son.
SUPFEMALE:Remember, the guy that carries all the heavy stuff around the house? And I'm your wife.
LEADFEMALE:We're married.
LEADMALE:Married? No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:We Orkans never marry.
LEADMALE:And besides, I would never marry a species who'd make Don Ho rich.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, something has happened to you to make you forget your life on Earth.
LEADFEMALE:Here, sit down.
SUPMALE:I think maybe I can help you to remember.
LEADMALE:Oh, gladly.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, I can't go through this again.
LEADMALE:Daddy, Daddy, that's way off.
LEADFEMALE:Here, turn around.
LEADFEMALE:Here, you sit just like this: - Like I do.
LEADFEMALE:- Kay-o.
LEADFEMALE:Ah! Oh, all the blood is rushing to my feet.
LEADFEMALE:If we're not married, why are we wearing matching rings? Perhaps you like the same cereal.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:It's because we made a commitment to spend the rest of our lives together.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute there, whoa.
LEADMALE:Getting a little too intense now.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know what your game is, lady, but I'm not staying around here.
LEADFEMALE:Not gonna stay till some hunchback goes, "Quick, we must do this," and puts my brain in a jar.
OTHERMALE:- Wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:- No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Mork! Mork, we're not trying to hurt you.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, we're not trying to hurt you, we love you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mommy looks like I'm, uh, the man of the house now.
SUPMALE:Sort of looks that way, doesn't it, sweetheart? Mm-hm.
SUPMALE:Fix dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy? Mork? Shh! Down on your knees.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you recognize Sebal, god of humidity? I sure do.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:When it's his birthday, we're out of school.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Come with me.
SUPMALE:Come on over here.
SUPMALE:This is the seat of honor.
SUPMALE:Right here, right here.
SUPFEMALE:Sit right down there.
OTHERMALE:And just think.
LEADMALE:Mork from Ork, this was your life.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, if I'd only known, I would have done something special to my hair.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Mork, you've had a very interesting life.
SUPMALE:You spent a typical Orkan boyhood in a nursing home, complaining about the food and the sing-alongs.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, to be young and senile again.
SUPMALE:- "Soon it was on to Chester A School for Boys, where you were voted most likely to wear wool.
OTHERMALE:You were sent to Earth to observe.
LEADFEMALE:There you met a beautiful, small-nosed woman.
LEADMALE:" Listen.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, I'll never forget the day we exchanged our vows.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, Orson turned you into a dog? And for weeks you kept sneaking out for Gaines-Burgers.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Do you recognize that voice? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Is it Ella Fitzgerald? Phew.
SUPMALE:Ahem.
LEADFEMALE:No, silly, that's Mom.
SUPMALE:Mom? Is Moms Mabley here? No.
OTHERMALE:It's Mindy McConnell.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's you again.
LEADFEMALE:You look great.
LEADMALE:I can't believe anybody as foxy as you isn't married already.
SUPFEMALE:I am married, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:I'm married to you.
SUPFEMALE:Think about it, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:- Mork - Oh, that'll be a lot easier this way.
LEADFEMALE:Try to think of the good times.
LEADMALE:Think of all the fun we've had and the laughs.
LEADMALE:Think about this, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Who do you call your little pooter? Is my old shop teacher here, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bromex? No, he's not here.
LEADMALE:Oh, go ahead, Mearth.
LEADMALE:"And so, with your blushing bride, you inherited a wonderful family.
LEADFEMALE:" Listen.
LEADFEMALE:Fredzo, wait.
LEADFEMALE:You're not supposed to go out until I say my line.
LEADMALE:How come you got a line and I didn't? Oh, you're such a wiener.
SUPMALE:Oh! This is ridiculous.
SUPMALE:- Dad.
LEADMALE:- Hi.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bromex! Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Bromex, it really is you.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mork, it's Dad.
OTHERMALE:Fred McConnell and Grandma Cora.
SUPMALE:Look at them, Mork, and concentrate.
SUPMALE:Oh, isn't she a little young for him? Honey Come here, honey.
LEADMALE:Now, every now and then we're given a second chance, and when that opportunity comes along, you gotta be smart enough to know how to take advantage of it.
SUPFEMALE:Now, look, I'll go warm up the car, we'll take Mork out for a little ride and we'll drop him off.
LEADFEMALE:Say, in, uh, a silo in South Dakota.
SUPFEMALE:- Grandma, he's doing it again.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Fred, lay off.
SUPFEMALE:Now, the kids are very happy.
LEADMALE:Happy? He doesn't even know who she is.
LEADFEMALE:- Dad - Please, please, please.
LEADFEMALE:We'll have time to talk about all this at the party after the show.
LEADFEMALE:Will you take your seats? Take your seats, please.
SUPFEMALE:The couch, two chairs.
SUPMALE:Will you take yours, please? Thank you, thank you.
SUPMALE:Mork, you've encountered many beings in your travels, but none as eccentric as this next person.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, is that you? Exidor, is that you? He remembers! He remembers.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, this is a red-letter day.
LEADMALE:You've got your memory back, and I'm finally gonna meet Moms Mabley.
LEADFEMALE:Exidor, it's so good to see you.
LEADMALE:I mean, I was getting really lonely having no one to really talk to.
LEADMALE:Ask him more questions so that he remembers more.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:I owe him $10.
SUPMALE:I'll cover it.
LEADFEMALE:In that case, he owes me 20.
LEADMALE:- Mindy, I have a full tank of gas.
LEADMALE:- Good.
OTHERMALE:I'll get you a match.
SUPMALE:I've got it.
LEADMALE:I know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:The solution is as simple and plain as the nose on Pepe's face.
OTHERFEMALE:Hypnosis.
LEADMALE:All I need is a gold watch.
OTHERFEMALE:- Hey! - Here.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Unfortunately, a subject cannot be hypnotized unless he's willing.
SUPFEMALE:Safe! Juanita, you got away with it this time, but don't you ever, ever take that big a lead on the left-handed pitcher again.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork, step into my office.
LEADMALE:- Gladly.
OTHERMALE:Hi, Skeeter.
SUPFEMALE:Working on a little sister for you.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Mork, put your hands in front of your face and repeat after me.
LEADFEMALE:"Oh, no, please don't.
LEADMALE:" All right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, please don't.
LEADFEMALE:Too late.
SUPMALE:That man is an absolute raving lunatic.
SUPMALE:Madam, you flatter me.
LEADFEMALE:- Are you all right? - Who are you? Amazing.
LEADMALE:Total amnesia.
OTHERMALE:All right, get out of my house.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no, thank you very much, but I have to go.
SUPMALE:Tonight is the first Annual Exidor Dance Marathon.
LEADFEMALE:You run 26 miles and then bunny hop across the finish line.
LEADMALE:I don't care what the guy said, I was standing right there and Juanita was out.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess now's as good a time as any.
LEADMALE:Oh, God.
LEADFEMALE:Come in.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't mean to be patronizing, but on Ork we have doorbells.
OTHERMALE:Well, we're a slow but happy people.
LEADFEMALE:Anything on your mind? Well, besides 14 pounds per square inch air pressure, nothing really, except I want to thank you very much for your hospitality this evening, and I'd like to find out what was the name of that dessert we had? Jell-O.
LEADFEMALE:You used to love to eat it in the mornings.
LEADFEMALE:But then you don't remember, do you? What are you doing? Well, whenever I get depressed, I engage in an old Earth custom called cleaning out the closet.
SUPMALE:- Mind if I watch? - No, actually you could help.
SUPFEMALE:- Half of the stuff is yours.
LEADFEMALE:- Ooh.
SUPMALE:Is this mine? No.
LEADMALE:Too bad, it's my color.
LEADMALE:Whoa, ha, ha! Where did you get this stuffed Splock? Was the Orkan carnival passing through here? No.
LEADMALE:You won this for me on our honeymoon.
LEADFEMALE:You won it by throwing lead bottles at a pile of softballs.
LEADFEMALE:Remember? Then we went to the anti-gravity bar to hear your favorite group, Wink Geezba and the Gold Diggers.
LEADMALE:I remembered we danced on air till the suns came up.
SUPMALE:And we went for a little walk on the beach, and you told me I guess it doesn't matter what you told me, does it? Your eyes are leaking.
LEADMALE:It's called crying.
OTHERMALE:Why are you crying? Oh, I'm crying because Because you're here and I miss you.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:What are you doing now? I'm expressing emotion.
LEADMALE:See, on Earth, when people love each other, they do this.
LEADFEMALE:The capital of New York is Albany.
OTHERMALE:What did you say? You have a mole on the bottom of your foot shaped like Scatman Crothers.
LEADMALE:Oh! I'm about to remember something really important now.
SUPMALE:- About us? - No.
SUPMALE:That Italian restaurants are closed on Mondays.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh! The memory dam is breaking! It's all coming back to me now.
SUPMALE:But I need some help.
LEADMALE:Now I know I I can remember everything except all the teams in the National Hockey League.
LEADMALE:We better try once more.
LEADMALE:I finally remembered what I wanted to say to you.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, what? - I love you.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork Oh, Mork, I was so scared.
LEADMALE:What happened to you? Where have you been? When? - When you got amnesia.
LEADMALE:- Oh, I was trying to forget that, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:You know You know what happened? Orson got a little mad at me, and, well, he closed my account in the memory bank.
OTHERFEMALE:- Why? - Well, see, I've been spending so much time with you and Mearth that Well, I've been neglecting my job.
LEADMALE:And he thinks I'm a bad observer.
SUPFEMALE:I keep forgetting that what you do is a real important job.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it's not like you get a W-2 form or you have a pension plan.
LEADFEMALE:And you get paid in sand.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but it's still my job, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:I've blown it.
SUPMALE:See, I've even let my subscription to Ebony run out.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we'll just have to renew that.
OTHERFEMALE:And also, we're gonna have to make sure that you spend as much time as you need to make your job a good one.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, you're gonna be the best observer Ork ever had.
LEADMALE:Even better than Andy Rooney? Yes.
LEADMALE:And neater too.
LEADMALE:Just one more shot for old time's sake.
SUPFEMALE:I remember our phone number now.
LEADMALE:It's all coming back to me.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Dad.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, wait, wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:I've got some great news.
SUPMALE:Mork remembers.
SUPMALE:That is the great news.
LEADMALE:Well, he likes you.
SUPFEMALE:Talk to you later.
SUPMALE:Goodbye.
OTHERMALE:You know Lady.
OTHERMALE:Lady, it's happening again.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, no.
SUPMALE:- I'm losing it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm fading back into the distance.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:All I can remember is one word.
LEADFEMALE:Big kiss.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Your Saturated Fatship.
LEADMALE:And now for the fast-breaking news of Earth.
LEADFEMALE:Reported with keen insight and renewed vigor, plus greetings from the McConnell clan.
LEADFEMALE:- You remember your family? - Of course, sir.
LEADFEMALE:I'd better check the warranty on that memory helmet.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it works fine, sir, but nothing can make me forget those that I love.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course, you must keep in mind your responsibilities too.
SUPMALE:Allow me to demonstrate, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Notice, while I am balancing this ball, I am also carrying on a serious conversation with you.
OTHERMALE:Fascinating illustration.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
LEADMALE:I'm concentrating on the ball.
LEADFEMALE:That's the point I want to make, sir.
LEADFEMALE:You see, when you accept the responsibility of a job and a family, you must be very careful to fulfill your duties to each one.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it's easy once you get the hang of it.
SUPMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't this the kind of snazzy report you've been looking for, sir? It's got everything.
OTHERMALE:Handsome leading man, staggering special effects, memorable theme song.
LEADMALE:Morko, the boy from beyond You know Why do I put up with him? If it wasn't for the pension, I'd quit.
LEADFEMALE:Na-no, na-no.
LEADMALE:Daddy, my packages are gone.
LEADFEMALE:What a bummer.
LEADMALE:We've gotta get the kinks out of that lousy Orkan beam.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we've cross-beamed again.
OTHERFEMALE:This isn't the Jacuzzi.
LEADFEMALE:You aren't Roxanne.
LEADMALE:Give me my champagne.
LEADMALE:Give me those glasses.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Just a second.
LEADFEMALE:You perspire a lot, don't you? I gotta get a little R & R.
SUPMALE:Beam me up, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You forgot to tell me if they kill off Spock or not.
SUPFEMALE:I wonder what he's gonna do with Roxanne.
LEADMALE:Anything he wants, son.
LEADMALE:He's a captain.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, let's go work on your science project.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Boy, I'm sure glad I didn't get stuck with this dinosaur diorama - that Mommy made me.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, come on now, son.
LEADFEMALE:Mom tried.
SUPMALE:I didn't have the heart to tell her on Ork dinosaurs run the garment district.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look at what you've got though, son.
SUPMALE:Boy, wait till your Orkan classmates get a load of this.
OTHERMALE:Oh, it's so good, they're gonna hate you.
OTHERMALE:Listen, don't put my Orkan classmates down, Daddy.
LEADMALE:I tell you, there's one out there that's colonizing a planet.
SUPMALE:Oh, ha, ha.
SUPFEMALE:That's amateur night in the Bijou.
LEADMALE:Oh, but look, this home computer will not only answer the phone, balance your checkbook, but also tell you why boneless chickens can walk.
LEADMALE:- Daddy, Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:- You really pulled this one off.
OTHERMALE:Daddy, please, just for a moment, huh? I believe this is my project.
LEADMALE:- Do you wanna win? - Sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Just Daddy, Daddy, just one other thing.
SUPFEMALE:Don't put those two wires together.
LEADMALE:Son.
LEADMALE:Son, you're talking to a man who splits atoms for a hobby.
LEADMALE:Here we go, son.
SUPMALE:Watch.
LEADFEMALE:This is a great moment in science.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:- Are you all right? - Sure.
LEADMALE:Well, finish this before noon because it's not my project.
LEADFEMALE:Good luck.
LEADFEMALE:Good evening, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Hope you had a pleasant day.
SUPFEMALE:- Who did that? - I did.
SUPMALE:Care for a martini? Oh, uh Who are you? You're What are you? I am Mearth's science project.
LEADFEMALE:A Modular Integrated Laser Transformer.
SUPMALE:My friends, if I had any, would call me MILT.
LEADMALE:Care for some toast? Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Thank you, MILT.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, Mindy, let me be the first computer to congratulate you on your broadcasting award nomination.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, what do you think of our little Mearth's science project here, huh? Heh.
LEADMALE:I always said he had my brains and your love of shellfish.
SUPMALE:Well, it sure looks impressive.
LEADFEMALE:What does it do? Mind, not only is MILT a notary public and a tax expert, but it's a 24-hour security system and a promising amateur photographer.
LEADMALE:Say "cheese.
LEADFEMALE:" - Look at this.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh.
LEADMALE:He even airbrushed out the crow's feet around my eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Sure beats the heck out of my diorama.
LEADMALE:Even though the pterodactyl flew in it.
LEADMALE:Your rump roast is now defrosted and the oven has been preheated to 325.
LEADFEMALE:Our vegetable for this evening is lima beans.
LEADFEMALE:I hate lima beans.
SUPMALE:Everybody does.
LEADFEMALE:However, Mindy, I did perform a metabolic scan that shows you are a little low in potassium.
LEADFEMALE:Potassium.
LEADMALE:Mearth, now, go wash your hands before dinner.
LEADFEMALE:I should wash my face too.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:And don't forget behind the ears.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you for reminding me, MILT.
OTHERFEMALE:"Thank you for reminding me"? For me to get him to do that, I need a whip and a chair.
OTHERMALE:You know, MILT, I think this is gonna be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
SUPMALE:You know something, Mind? I have this strange urge to put on an ugly scarf, go to a supermarket and squeeze grapes going, "Is Luke still married?" Why do you have on my curlers? Well, I've never been to a television awards banquet.
LEADMALE:I thought it was some kind of tradition, like when you pray before you go into a coal mine.
OTHERMALE:What? - Wait.
SUPFEMALE:Take it - Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:- Bad idea, bad idea.
OTHERMALE:- All right, all right.
SUPFEMALE:Here, can you help me? My hands are shaking.
LEADMALE:I can't seem to get it.
LEADMALE:Okay, that's all right.
LEADMALE:All right, here we go.
LEADMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:- Mork.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, well, don't be nervous.
SUPMALE:Come on, let me hear your acceptance speech.
OTHERMALE:There we are.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I don't have an acceptance speech.
LEADMALE:I'm probably not gonna win.
LEADFEMALE:You think? Oh, sure you will, hon.
LEADMALE:Remember, when you do win, mention me and Mearth by name, none of this "they know who they are" stuff.
OTHERMALE:- Okay.
SUPFEMALE:- All right.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but what if I don't win? Well, keep your speech real short.
LEADMALE:And you'll still be my little pooter, precious.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Where's my other shoe? Have you seen it? I'll help you find it.
SUPMALE:Mindy, I believe your shoe is under the bed.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, MILT.
LEADMALE:- You're welcome.
SUPMALE:MILT, what are you doing in here? I have expanded.
OTHERFEMALE:I am now servicing the bedroom and bathroom, and I'm going through your mail to eliminate any letters that start "Dear concerned piano owner.
SUPFEMALE:" MILT, if anything is addressed to alien, it's mine.
SUPMALE:- Of course.
OTHERMALE:Oh, and, Mindy? - Yes, MILT? You're wearing too much eye shadow.
LEADMALE:I think I know how to put on my own makeup, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:That's debatable.
LEADFEMALE:I think MILT is getting a little too big for his oscillator.
LEADFEMALE:Come on now, Mind, I mean, heh, he hasn't been wrong yet, and besides, Mind, I think it's true.
LEADMALE:I mean, we're talking raccoon city here.
OTHERMALE:I mean, it's all right, but, you know, early Liza Minnelli.
SUPMALE:It's fine.
LEADMALE:I'm so tired of doing homework.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth, we achieve success in academia the old-fashioned way.
LEADFEMALE:We earn it.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Mearth, Grandpa is waiting.
SUPFEMALE:I prefer he stay and do his homework.
LEADFEMALE:MILT, you don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:Grandpa is babysitting.
LEADMALE:They're gonna watch the show together.
OTHERFEMALE:- Come on, sweetie.
OTHERMALE:- I don't want to go to see the show.
OTHERMALE:I wanna see King Hussein on The Muppet Show.
LEADMALE:- You're gonna go to Grandpa's - I'm not going.
LEADMALE:- Mearth - "Mearth" You're gonna watch the awards show with Grandpa.
LEADMALE:Don't echo.
LEADFEMALE:Stop it.
SUPFEMALE:- Here you go.
LEADMALE:- You're not going anywhere.
SUPFEMALE:MILT, what do you think you're doing? I was created and programmed to provide for your needs, yet you continue to ignore my directives.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth should be doing his homework, you should take off half that eye shadow, and as for you, Mork, even I don't know where to begin.
LEADMALE:No one tells my family what it can do.
LEADMALE:Unless he can back it up with 20,000 volts.
LEADFEMALE:Glad you see it my way.
SUPMALE:Anyone care for a Pop-Tart? MILT, come on now, you can't hold us hostage.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, this is a big night for Mindy.
LEADMALE:She waxed both legs.
LEADMALE:MILT, we have to go to the awards.
LEADMALE:Dad is babysitting Mearth.
SUPMALE:He's expecting us.
LEADMALE:I've taken care of that.
LEADMALE:- Hello? - Hi, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, Mearth won't be coming over tonight.
LEADMALE:We're taking him to the awards with us.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's wonderful.
SUPMALE:I'll be rooting for you.
SUPMALE:- Bye, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe that MILT imitated my voice.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe you lied to your own father.
SUPFEMALE:MILT, I want you to let us out of here now! You really shouldn't yell.
OTHERMALE:You'll develop a node on your vocal cords.
LEADMALE:Relax.
LEADMALE:You're not going anywhere.
SUPMALE:From now on, this house is your world.
LEADMALE:I guess we're gonna be here for a long time.
LEADMALE:Hope there's some Mork, we can't stay here forever.
LEADFEMALE:Of course you can.
LEADFEMALE:I'll phone for the groceries, pay the bills through your bank computer, and every Saturday, we'll have a sock hop.
OTHERFEMALE:Number, please.
LEADMALE:Daddy.
OTHERMALE:Daddy, I think it's time.
LEADMALE:He's gone far enough.
LEADMALE:Are you ready? It's time for the finger.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? Well, the scientific technical explanation is, Mind, he kicked our tush.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, MILT-y.
OTHERMALE:I mean, let us go.
OTHERMALE:It's my first nomination.
LEADMALE:Look, I promise if you let us go, we'll come straight home.
LEADFEMALE:We won't even stop for pizza.
SUPMALE:How sincere.
LEADFEMALE:Unfortunately, your increased heart rate belies your true intention.
LEADMALE:Get off.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe I was just thinking about winning the award.
SUPFEMALE:I interfaced with the balloting computer.
LEADMALE:You lost by a landslide.
OTHERMALE:- I lost.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, sorry, pooter.
SUPFEMALE:Frankly, I was surprised you were even nominated.
LEADMALE:All right, that's it.
OTHERFEMALE:You can lock us in here and keep us prisoner, but when you deny me the right to go to the awards and sit there and lose with this phony smile on my face, that's it.
SUPMALE:You're nothing but a glorified toaster.
LEADFEMALE:She didn't mean it.
LEADMALE:See, that's a term of endearment.
LEADMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:She calls me her little waffle iron.
LEADMALE:Relax, Mindy, or as the kids say, "Kick back.
LEADFEMALE:" You know something, MILT? You're absolutely right.
LEADMALE:As a matter of fact, I think we should all go take a shower.
OTHERMALE:Yeah Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:That's right, MILT.
SUPMALE:Family shower? I didn't think people did that in the Midwest, Mind.
SUPMALE:This is the only room in the house where we can take our shower.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, everyone, let's all take our shower just like we do every week.
OTHERFEMALE:What's going on here? - Are we pledging a fraternity? - Come on now, son, this is how everyone used to shower after they saw Psycho.
LEADFEMALE:Mama, he's gotta be kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Are we all taking a shower together? Of course we are.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:MILT, can you hear us? MILT, I have a question.
OTHERFEMALE:Great, he can't hear us with the water running.
LEADMALE:Okay, Mork, we've gotta figure out a way to deactivate him.
SUPMALE:Gotta work fast too, or we'll run out of hot water and won't be able to wash our hair.
SUPFEMALE:I don't wanna wash my hair.
LEADFEMALE:I get soap in my eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody's gonna wash their hair.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, we've gotta figure out how to pull the plug on MILT.
SUPMALE:- Snuff MILT? - Snuff MILT? Shh! Aren't you being a little rash? Couldn't we just force him to do an anti-drug film? What's the matter with you? Oh, come on, I'm cold.
OTHERMALE:Can I have the middle now, please? Thank you.
LEADMALE:Mork, he's It's holding us captive here.
SUPMALE:This is ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:We've gotta figure out how to pull the plug on him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, well, don't look at me.
LEADMALE:I mean, I just build them.
SUPMALE:There's a union that bumps them off.
SUPFEMALE:Can you pass the soap? - We're out of it.
LEADMALE:- Oh.
LEADMALE:You've seen Harry Houdini, you've seen Harry Blackstone, but you've never seen anything like the Magnificent Mearth.
LEADMALE:Rex Reed said "intrinsic," Clive Barnes said "why?" Assisting him is the wonderful shiksa goddess, Mindola.
SUPFEMALE:And now the Magnificent Mearth will make a man disappear before your very eye.
LEADMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:Okay, could I have a volunteer from the audience, please? How about you, sir? Oh, no, thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:I just came here to see Mort Sahl.
LEADMALE:Shame on you.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes.
SUPFEMALE:Will you step in there please, Daddy? Incidentally, before I put Daddy in here, there you'll notice are just some old dirty clothes and a rather attractive space suit, and we have Bonzo and two other actors.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Now, Daddy, if you will get into the armoire.
OTHERMALE:- Step in, please.
SUPMALE:- Guess this should be one way of getting out of my Columbia record contract.
LEADMALE:- There we go.
OTHERMALE:- Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to, at this very time, say something very difficult that I've learned from Thurston and the late Houdini, who fell 600 feet into Off the Brooklyn Bridge into very cold water.
SUPFEMALE:These are the magical words: Oh, my gosh, it worked.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's magnificent, Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I'd be impressed if I were some cheap pocket calculator.
LEADFEMALE:Well, next, Magnificent Mearth will prove to you that the hand is quicker than the electronic eye.
LEADMALE:How true.
LEADFEMALE:How true.
SUPMALE:It's time for What do we see? Yes.
LEADMALE:Hankies, look at these.
SUPFEMALE:Look at all those hankies.
SUPFEMALE:Where did you get them? I got these from all over my body.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
SUPMALE:That's the show, MILT, because it's good night.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha! We're free.
SUPFEMALE:We're free just like those little bottles of shampoo we get in the mail.

SUPFEMALE:What a coincidence.
LEADFEMALE:The charade is over, people.
LEADFEMALE:Naturally, I anticipated an escape attempt, so I switched over to nuclear power.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course, come summer, I shall go solar.
SUPFEMALE:MILT, can we talk as two rational beings? It was her idea, I tell you.
LEADMALE:She made me do it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please, don't hurt me.
SUPMALE:I wanna have more children.
SUPMALE:Stop groveling, man.
SUPFEMALE:Relax.
LEADFEMALE:I would never cause any of you harm, unless you try something stupid like that again.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you think we're just gonna stand around here while you control our lives, you've got a screw loose, buster.
OTHERFEMALE:You're nothing but a mechanical dictator, and we'll never stop fighting you, and we will win.

SUPFEMALE:I mean, son, I mean, we can go out laughing.
SUPFEMALE:You know what I mean? - I mean, hey, tell them that joke.

LEADFEMALE:I never programmed him to laugh.
LEADFEMALE:He's got a flaw.
OTHERMALE:- You've got a million of them.
OTHERFEMALE:- Okay.
SUPMALE:Seriously, it's so nice to be back here once again.
LEADMALE:Hey, what do you call a bunch of rabbits walking backwards? A receding hare line.
SUPFEMALE:How many Venutians does it take to screw in a light bulb? None.

LEADMALE:You're killing me.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm overloading.
SUPFEMALE:I got one.
LEADMALE:I got one.

LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha! Stop it.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna wet my circuits.
LEADMALE:Keep going, keep going.
SUPMALE:This guy walks into a psychiatrist's office and says: "Doc, I have this inferiority complex.

LEADMALE:Polly Kong.
SUPFEMALE:Polly Kong.
LEADMALE:Oh, it was such a good joke.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever it is, if he still wants a cracker, you'd better get it.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you, Mind.
LEADMALE:We'll get back to you on that one.
LEADMALE:You know, it's so nice to be back here.
LEADFEMALE:You know, my neighborhood was so tough, guys used to bowl overhand.
LEADFEMALE:Another friend of mine got arrested, they said you have one call.
LEADFEMALE:He did a perfect blue jay.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? Ha, ha! Stop it.
LEADMALE:Stop it.
LEADMALE:You're killing me.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha! Well, now, you know, the girls in my Girls in my neighborhood were no great shakes, if you know what I'm saying.
OTHERMALE:They were two-baggers.

LEADFEMALE:" Finally, I'm gonna finish him off now.
SUPMALE:This blind guy walks into a department store, he's got his dog on a leash, takes him to the clothing department, starts swinging him around.
SUPMALE:Puts him down.
LEADFEMALE:This guy walks over, says: "Can I help you?" He says, "No, thanks, I'm just looking around.
SUPMALE:" Mork, is he? Is he? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Mind, MILT's dead.
LEADMALE:Because he had a lousy sense of humor.
OTHERMALE:Thank God it's all over.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Your Funky Chunkyship.
LEADFEMALE:- Make it quick, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Sir.
SUPMALE:I'm expected at the intergalactic Conference and Cake Walk.
SUPMALE:Oh, sir.
OTHERMALE:This week, sir, I learned about the relationship between man and machine.
SUPFEMALE:You see, sir, the computer age has allowed man so much more spare time to pursue the finer points of life, a greater education, spiritual enlightenment, and the perfect tan.
SUPMALE:It sounds like your wife's people are becoming a highly practical and efficient race.
OTHERMALE:Well, they are, sir, but they're becoming a little dependent on their technology.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't Earthlings cute at that stage of evolution? Oh, sir, wouldn't it be sad, though, if tomorrow's children spend so much time playing video football they'd never know the real joy of being tackled by a line-backer going: "You're gonna bite it now"? But, sir, what really worries me is that they're gonna lose the desire and the ingenuity that allowed them to build the machines in the first place.
LEADMALE:Just a little something to think about, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Until next week, na-no, na-no.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Na-no, na-no.
LEADMALE:You know, I love this part of the day.
SUPMALE:When we get a few hours to ourselves.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You know what would make it really perfect, little pooter precious? - Not again.
OTHERMALE:- Oh.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:We came so close last time.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, all right.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, yay.
OTHERFEMALE:I want you to know this is the third time since the 11:00 news.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, heh-heh.
LEADFEMALE:Alrighty.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:At a four-way stop, who has the right of way? Let's see.
LEADFEMALE:Any vehicle driven by a teamster.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Now, Mork, with answers like that, you're never gonna get your license.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get served in restaurants where the maître d' goes: "You wanna sit down now?" Can you be serious for a minute? - Certainly.
LEADMALE:- Okay.
OTHERMALE:Mommy and Daddy, I can't sleep.
SUPFEMALE:The neighbors are so noisy.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, what does "cheap floozy" mean? Never mind.
SUPMALE:Why don't you lie down next to Daddy? - Come on, Daddy.
OTHERFEMALE:- I don't wanna lie down next to Daddy.
LEADMALE:Teddy, what do you see, Teddy? Teddy always see something.
LEADFEMALE:Over there, Teddy.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go, Teddy.
SUPFEMALE:You little sniffer.
LEADMALE:What is it? Teddy sees cookies.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, maybe I will lie down with Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth, you've got two choices.
SUPMALE:We can finish the story we started at naptime and you can go to bed, or you can just go to bed.
SUPMALE:I think the choice is pretty obvious.
SUPFEMALE:All right, while you kids have fun, I'm gonna work out why half the people on the road found it and the other half never lost it.
SUPMALE:Let's see, hand signals, we have a Let's see, right turn, left turn, ethnic neighborhood, right on, for sure, totally, maybe we don't know.
LEADMALE:- Let's see.
OTHERMALE:- Okay.
OTHERMALE:U-turn, not me.
OTHERFEMALE:U-turn Okay, sweetie, here we go.
LEADFEMALE:- Are you ready? - Yes, Teddy's listening too.
LEADMALE:"The maiden told Rumpelstiltskin the king would behead her if she didn't spin all the straw into gold by dawn.
LEADFEMALE:Rumpelstiltskin offered to save her in exchange for her firstborn child.
LEADFEMALE:" You know something, Mommy? I've heard this story so many times.
LEADMALE:That's where the maiden remembers Rumpelstiltskin's name and marries a prince.
LEADFEMALE:End of story.
LEADMALE:That's not how it ends, is it, Mind? - I'm afraid so.
LEADFEMALE:- Muh! You ruined that story for me.
LEADMALE:And now, you wanna know something? Wanna know what I know about Santa? - Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- He's All right, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna tell you something, Mommy, very honestly.
LEADFEMALE:These fairy tales are for babies.
SUPFEMALE:I really think I've progressed to Joseph Wambaugh.
OTHERMALE:Mearth, you know, when I was a girl, I couldn't read enough fairy tales.
LEADFEMALE:I used to dream that I could spin straw into gold so that I could be a princess and live in a big castle.
LEADMALE:Get ready for a real winner now, son.
LEADMALE:It was a beautiful castle.
OTHERFEMALE:I had my very own white stallion named Snowball.
OTHERFEMALE:Or No, no, Snowflake.
LEADFEMALE:Or something like that, something to do with winter.
SUPMALE:Anyway, we would ride Snowflake, or Snowball, or whatever his name was, to the neighboring castle where Ricky Nelson, who was the neighboring prince, lived.
LEADMALE:Ricky Nelson and I would get on Snowflake and go My stories aren't so bad.
LEADMALE:I'm a riot at bridal showers.
LEADMALE:All right now, son, I want you to add one cup of faditche.
SUPFEMALE:Put it in there, that's it.
LEADMALE:Don't be too liberal with that.
OTHERFEMALE:And a little bit of nipgeeze.
LEADMALE:There it is, a little touch of nipgeeze there.
SUPMALE:Mm-hm.
OTHERFEMALE:That's it.
SUPFEMALE:Just a pinch.
LEADFEMALE:All right, and one kosher salami.
LEADMALE:Here we go, there we are.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth, your grandpops has done it again.
SUPFEMALE:I got a couple of tickets to the Ice Capades.
SUPMALE:Of course, I had to go to a scalper.
LEADMALE:Oh, you've been going to one of those for years, haven't you? Very funny, Mork.
SUPMALE:Ver Hey, this is a pretty sophisticated piece of equipment.
OTHERMALE:What are you two doing? We're making gold for Mommy.
SUPFEMALE:You're making gold? What did I just get through saying? You've got to learn to pay attention, Grandpops.
SUPMALE:But, Mearth, you can't make gold.
SUPMALE:Nobody can.
SUPFEMALE:That's why it's worth $400 an ounce.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on now, Pops.
OTHERMALE:Four-hundred dollars an ounce? If you were saying mustard or sand, I could say, "Hey.
LEADMALE:" But gold, that much? Get off it there, Dad.
LEADMALE:- I think it's ready, Daddy.
LEADMALE:- All right.
SUPMALE:Pops, can we borrow your tie, please? - My what? - What did he say? Didn't he say give him your tie? - You just don't listen.
LEADFEMALE:- All right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm about to turn this bargain-basement tie into pure gold.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, ho-ho.
SUPFEMALE:This is gonna work.
LEADFEMALE:I know it will, son.
SUPFEMALE:Here it is.
SUPFEMALE:Ready? Give it five seconds.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:Mork, you may be my son-in-law, but think about this: I've never taken a picture with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Mearth, let's go.
LEADMALE:See you later, Goldfinger.
SUPMALE:If there were advice I could give you, Daddy, don't sweat it.
LEADMALE:What went wrong? What? Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:This cheap tie is pure silk.
LEADFEMALE:The recipe calls for polyester.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Improvise.
LEADMALE:This will do it.
SUPFEMALE:Put it in there.
OTHERMALE:You've got to do it for me.
SUPMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:Or I'll lose my government grant.
SUPMALE:There are no more government grants.
OTHERMALE:Who cares? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Yes! I've done it.
LEADFEMALE:They didn't believe me.
LEADMALE:I did it.
LEADMALE:We're filthy rich.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll never have to pay taxes again.
SUPFEMALE:You bought this mansion? We made 3 tons of gold.
LEADMALE:We could have bought Zambia.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:Yes, this is the downstairs reading room.
SUPMALE:Upstairs we have periodicals and books by the Wallace family.
SUPMALE:- Mork, it's huge.
LEADMALE:- Well I mean, I've never seen a room with a horizon before.
LEADMALE:You're probably wondering how I get the books down from the top shelf.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, with our helicopter? Close, but no banana.
LEADMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, Ms.
LEADMALE:Beasley! Yes, Mr.
LEADMALE:McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:Perhaps a little poetry? D.
SUPFEMALE:H.
OTHERMALE:Lawrence, E.
LEADMALE:E.
LEADMALE:Cummings, B.
LEADMALE:B.
LEADMALE:King? Oh, not today.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe tomorrow we'll play a little one-on-one and a half.
SUPMALE:Well, Mind, should I show you the zoo now or later? What was that? Oh, probably just the chef taking the gardeners home.
LEADFEMALE:- We have a jet? - Well Oh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:This is just all so much for anyone to have.
LEADFEMALE:Why do I feel guilty about not feeling guilty? Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind, my little WASPette.
OTHERMALE:Heh-heh.
LEADMALE:For the first time in our relationship, I can provide for you and fund public television.
LEADMALE:So just humor me, huh? But, you know, this house is just It's really too big for just the three of us.
LEADMALE:I don't know how I'm gonna keep it up.
LEADMALE:Well, reach out and touch someone because, you know, help is just a tinkle away.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, staff! Mind, Mind, inspect them, inspect them, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I can't, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- I feel like the border patrol.
OTHERFEMALE:- Mind, you're the lady of the house.
SUPFEMALE:The least you could do is look down your nose at them.
LEADFEMALE:Um Well, I'd like you all to know that I'm very happy to meet all of you.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh, I'm looking forward to getting to know each and every one of you personally.
SUPMALE:A court jester? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:It's so hard to find one without a hump, Mind.
LEADMALE:He's got great references, though.
SUPFEMALE:He used to work for Marshal Tito.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thank you, everyone.
SUPMALE:Everyone grab a straw and go down to the swamp.
SUPMALE:They love me, honey.
SUPMALE:They really do.
SUPFEMALE:You know, it's so hard to find good wit nowadays.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I don't know if I'm going to be able to get used to all this.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey, now, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:We're still the same people we were when we lived in that little, tiny cracker-box apartment.
LEADFEMALE:Mommy.
SUPFEMALE:How about a couple of sets of tennis? Mearth, where's that girl I hired to teach you tennis? Tracy? Tracy, come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, take big steps.
LEADMALE:You hired Tracy Austin to teach Mearth, huh? Tracy.
OTHERMALE:Come on, I'll show you how to blink back the tears when the line calls go against you.
LEADFEMALE:You hired the number-one woman player in the world to teach Mearth? Well, yes, we're getting murdered in doubles.
LEADFEMALE:We had to do something.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, hon, I've got Arnold Schwarzenegger waiting in the gym to give you a massage.
LEADMALE:Okay, king me.
OTHERMALE:Excellent move, sir.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't see that coming.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please, Quentin.
LEADFEMALE:Are you kidding? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Magoo would've seen that one coming.
SUPMALE:Why did you do that, Quentin? - You let me win, didn't you? - Yes, yes, sir.
SUPMALE:- Why did you let me win? - I value my job, sir, as someday I dream of opening my own truck-rental agency.
SUPMALE:The game is over.
SUPMALE:Great game.
LEADMALE:Great game, ladies and gentlemen.
OTHERFEMALE:Good, good.
LEADFEMALE:Can I get you a before-dinner Bosco? No, you can't get me a before-dinner Bosco.
OTHERMALE:You know why? You just like to say "Bosco.
LEADFEMALE:" To be sure.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like him.
OTHERFEMALE:What's wrong, Mearth? Oh, Mommy, I'm bored.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been all through this place.
LEADFEMALE:All the rooms.
LEADFEMALE:I'm tired and I miss Daddy.
OTHERMALE:I know, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:I do too.
LEADMALE:But I'm gonna talk to him about spending more time together, okay? - Okay.
LEADFEMALE:- Okay.
SUPMALE:As a little backup, I made an appointment with him.
SUPMALE:As a matter of fact, for Tuesday, in his office.
LEADMALE:Gosh, I hope I can find his office.
SUPFEMALE:Madam, there's a gentleman here to see you.
OTHERFEMALE:I believe he's called "Pops.
OTHERFEMALE:" Oh! Oh, great, send him in.
LEADFEMALE:Send him in.
LEADFEMALE:Very good.
LEADFEMALE:Pops.
LEADMALE:How are you, sweetheart? Where's that genius son-in-law of mine? - Mork buy you that coat? - I guess so.
LEADFEMALE:I found it in the trunk of the Rolls he gave me.
SUPFEMALE:Is everybody going crazy around here? Oh, honey, now, now, look, I know exactly what you're thinking.
LEADMALE:I mean, I've always brought you up to appreciate the simple things in life, but, honey, you have to understand at the time I was poor and stupid.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, Dad, listen to me.
SUPFEMALE:This has just gone too far.
SUPMALE:Look at us.
SUPMALE:Look at you and me and especially Mork.
LEADFEMALE:How dare you talk about Mork that way.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Thomas.
LEADMALE:Come back around 5.
LEADMALE:We might need a ride to the front door.
LEADMALE:Don't bother washing it.
SUPMALE:We'll buy another one.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, darling, how are you? Big kiss.
LEADMALE:Mwah! Poppy, how are you? How are you? - Hello, son.
LEADFEMALE:How are you? - Oh, not too bad.
SUPMALE:Though I lost a $100,000 today.
SUPMALE:- Oh, stock market? - No, hole in my pants.
LEADMALE:Heh-heh.
LEADMALE:Oh, hon, time to play our little game again.
LEADMALE:- Right hand or left hand? Come on.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork, not again.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:You know how it makes me feel.
OTHERFEMALE:- Come on, come on, come on.
LEADMALE:- Okay.
LEADMALE:- Um, the right one.
LEADMALE:- Behold.
OTHERMALE:Oh, there we go.
SUPMALE:Little oyster droppings here.
SUPFEMALE:- There we are, huh? - Oh, what a guy.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, I've always told you it's just as easy to marry a rich alien as it is to marry a poor graduate student.
LEADMALE:- Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, we have to talk.
OTHERFEMALE:- Poppo.
LEADMALE:Look, I don't want your presents.
LEADFEMALE:I want you.
SUPMALE:Just buying things isn't the answer to everything.
LEADMALE:Neither is penicillin, but it sure helps a strep throat.
LEADMALE:Mork, I mean, look at us.
LEADMALE:A minute ago I walked in here and Mearth was playing a game of human checkers.
LEADFEMALE:Did Quentin beat him? I told him, lose or else go back to being Gaddafi's food taster.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get a hold of him right now.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you worry.
SUPMALE:Yo! Mork, this is what I'm talking about.
SUPMALE:Mind, I Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:- Will you talk to him, please? - Of course I will, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Now, look, son, you're the man of the house now, and I think you should run it any way you want.
SUPMALE:Thanks, Dad.
LEADMALE:Mork, we're gonna have to talk about this later because I gotta get changed to go to work, but I wanna talk to you.
LEADMALE:Oh, you don't have to because I resigned you.
LEADFEMALE:- You resigned me? - Well Well, what about my career? Well, if it means that much to you, I'll just have to buy you NBC.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, and he'll do it too.
OTHERFEMALE:He bought me the New York Philharmonic.
LEADMALE:I knew Bernstein had a price.
LEADMALE:Well, I don't want things just handed to me.
OTHERFEMALE:I wanna work for my career, for my success.
LEADFEMALE:Well, once you have NBC, you'll have to earn every penny.
LEADFEMALE:Olga.
LEADFEMALE:Looking good.
SUPMALE:Mork, what about Mearth? You just can't raise a normal child in this kind of an environment.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't you get my memo? Next week I'm sending him to school in Switzerland.
LEADFEMALE:Switzerland? All right, now you've gone too far.
OTHERMALE:If that's too far, we'll send him to school in England.
LEADFEMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:Listen to me.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I'm not happy here.
SUPFEMALE:This isn't our home.
SUPMALE:- Let's go back to our apartment.
SUPMALE:- Well, this is our home, hon.
LEADMALE:Well, it might be your home, but it's not for Mearth and me.
SUPMALE:Well, now, wait a minute, hon.
SUPFEMALE:Where are you going? I'm going home to our little cracker-box apartment.
LEADFEMALE:- Here.
SUPFEMALE:- But wait, wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:You can't go now.
OTHERFEMALE:J.
LEADFEMALE:D.
SUPMALE:Salinger's coming over to shoot the bull.
LEADFEMALE:She's gone, Pop.
SUPMALE:Ah! She'll get over it.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Pops.
SUPMALE:Pops, reason with her.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell her opportunity only knocks once unless you're Neil Sedaka.
LEADMALE:- Excuse me, sir.
LEADMALE:- Yes, Quentin.
LEADMALE:- Will there be anything else? - Oh, yes, yes.
LEADMALE:Let's fly down to Rio.
LEADFEMALE:It's Carnival time.
LEADMALE:We'll put on those big heads and try and get in the car.
SUPMALE:I'd love to, sir, but this is the day I spend with my family.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's right.
SUPMALE:Well, take care and have a good day.
LEADFEMALE:- Good day, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:- Say hello to Carmelita.
LEADMALE:I certainly will, sir.
SUPMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Well, self-reliance is fine, but I miss being waited on hand and foot.
SUPFEMALE:I miss Daddy.
OTHERMALE:Well, I miss Daddy too, but even more, I miss being waited on hand and foot.
LEADFEMALE:That's not very nice.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care if it's very nice.
LEADFEMALE:I'm spoiled rotten.
LEADMALE:I know that.
OTHERMALE:This is no time for sensitivity.
LEADFEMALE:- Shh.
SUPMALE:- Da Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Mind.
SUPMALE:- Oh, Mork, you came back.
SUPFEMALE:I knew you would.
OTHERMALE:I knew you'd listen to what I said and realize that love is what makes our world go round.
LEADMALE:Oh, hon, well, actually, that's real close because I came back to tell you that I'm going around the world, heh-heh, with my new love.
LEADMALE:Mind, not only is she intelligent and well-read, she can spike a volleyball from here to Key West.
LEADFEMALE:Kareem, eat your heart out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.
SUPMALE:Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, wake up.
SUPMALE:Oh, I was sleeping.
SUPMALE:Sleeping? You were snoring so loud I had to have Mearth wake you up before you blew your adenoids across the room.
SUPMALE:Mork, you're back.
LEADMALE:I mean, you're home.
OTHERMALE:- I mean - Well, why shouldn't I? I mean, my name's on the mailbox, my clothes are in the closet, my hair's on the soap.
SUPMALE:Oh, you know, I had such a weird dream.
OTHERMALE:What kind of a dream? Oh, I dreamed, um I dreamed that we lived in a big mansion with, um, butlers and maids and Tracy Austin.
LEADMALE:And then you left us.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, I mean, how can you dream that? I'd never leave you.
LEADMALE:I mean, with you my life has meaning, and without you, I'd just be another alien forced to do his own laundry.
LEADFEMALE:It was just a silly dream.
LEADFEMALE:I dreamed you could turn polyester into gold.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
SUPMALE:Make gold? I mean, it's impossible to make gold.
LEADMALE:But diamonds are a snap.
OTHERFEMALE:Mearth, go in the garage, get those charcoal briquettes.
LEADMALE:Mindy, you warm up the waffle iron.
LEADMALE:I'll go get my Oil of Olay.
LEADMALE:No, I don't want diamonds.
SUPMALE:And I don't want gold.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how about some French toast? Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, O Potentate of Pasta.
LEADFEMALE:Laying down on the job again, Mork? Oh, no, sir.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just getting in my mood for my report to you on dreams, a wonderful aspect of Earth behavior.
LEADFEMALE:Dreams? That's wonderful.
SUPMALE:What are they? They're little images that appear in an Earthling's mind when he's sleeping.
OTHERMALE:For example, sir, they come fast and furious, and sometimes they're out of sequence just like a Fellini film.
LEADMALE:They can take you to wonderful, strange places.
LEADFEMALE:- Ah! - Oh! - I see.
SUPFEMALE:- Yes, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Another frivolous Earth activity, like marching bands.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, sir.
LEADMALE:Dreams allow one to imagine strange and wonderful things.
LEADMALE:The most precious dreams of all, sir, are the ones that give you a hope for tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Till next week, sir, sweet dreams and na-no, na-no.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Na-no, na-no.
OTHERMALE:Daddy got his license.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy got his license.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, you lost, Grandpops.
LEADMALE:Fork over.
SUPFEMALE:Mork driving.
LEADMALE:Who would believe it could happen here? I keep thinking, one stiff wind four years ago and he would've landed in Kentucky.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Mork went out, set a goal for himself and he achieved it.
LEADMALE:I think you should be very proud of him.
OTHERFEMALE:Proud? He just drove out of a gas station with the attendant still under the hood.
LEADFEMALE:Made me laugh.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha! Oh, ho.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm free.
LEADFEMALE:I've got mobility now.
SUPMALE:I have got my license, the key to joie.
OTHERMALE:Oh, ho.
LEADMALE:Look at this.
SUPFEMALE:Look at that.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I can finally take that "Just Married" sticker off my bicycle.
LEADMALE:It was so hard dragging all those cans all these days.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, look, don't think of me as your father.
LEADFEMALE:Think of me as your savior.
LEADMALE:You can't turn that maniac loose on the highway.
LEADMALE:Will you have a little faith in Mork, please? He didn't try to discourage you when you took up karate.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, bless you, my little support system.
LEADFEMALE:This would be a red-letter day for me if I hadn't taken such a lousy picture.
OTHERMALE:Amidst all of this excitement, I've written a poem.
OTHERFEMALE:Here it is.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you read.
LEADMALE:"My Dad" by Mearth McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Now that my dad can drive And change a flat Please don't run over my new cat Bless you, son, bless you.
LEADMALE:That was wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:I loved your imagery and your meter.
LEADMALE:You know, it's kind of reminiscent of Ubie or Robert Blake.
SUPMALE:Oh, hello.
SUPMALE:Hi, uh, I'm Bob Miller, your neighbor from across the street.
LEADMALE:- Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:- I seem to have gotten your mail.
SUPFEMALE:- You're Mindy McConnell, aren't you? - Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:- Oh, and this is my husband, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, howdy.
SUPMALE:Hi, Bob.
OTHERMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:I've seen you.
LEADMALE:When are you gonna take down those Christmas lights? - Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:This is a subpoena.
SUPFEMALE:- That's right.
SUPMALE:Hey, isn't that great? Bob, what a kinda guy you are.
SUPFEMALE:Come over tomorrow, we'll wear shorts, stand by a fire and have a weenie roast.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Mork.
SUPMALE:You just walked in here and lied to me.
LEADFEMALE:You're a process server.
OTHERFEMALE:You just - You said you were our neighbor.
SUPMALE:- I am.
SUPFEMALE:I do live right across the street.
LEADFEMALE:- By the way, can I borrow your rake? - No.
SUPMALE:Sorry you have to be going, neighbor.
SUPMALE:Mind, come on.
LEADMALE:You can't treat people like that.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, if you do that, they'll be walking their dogs on our lawn.
LEADFEMALE:- What's this all about, honey? - I don't know.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Ugh.
SUPMALE:They want me to testify on that story I broke on the Hidden Springs Highway scandal.
OTHERMALE:You remember that one, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:It was where the road crew told me the contractor was skimping on the codes and paying the state inspectors to look the other way.
SUPFEMALE:I suppose they want you to tell them who supplied the information.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hm.
LEADMALE:Mommy, I hope you're not going to release the name of the informant.
LEADMALE:You should stand on the first amendment, on your rights as a journalist.
OTHERMALE:Too strong? It's okay when Lou Grant says it.
LEADFEMALE:I can identify with him.
LEADMALE:We've got matching bodies.
LEADFEMALE:I just can't believe that they would ask me to betray a confidence like that.
SUPMALE:If it wasn't for me, they wouldn't have the story in the first place.
OTHERMALE:Look, honey, I respect your principles, but haven't journalists gone to jail for standing on the first amendment? Oh, Dad, this is just a little construction scandal, not the Pentagon Papers.
SUPFEMALE:No, they're not gonna do anything to me.
OTHERMALE:This is News Line and I'm Larry Carroll.
SUPFEMALE:Today, KTNS reporter Mindy McConnell was cited for contempt of court and jailed for refusing to reveal her news source in the Hidden Springs bribery trial.
LEADFEMALE:In other news, finalists prep for the Miss Nude Colorado contest.
LEADFEMALE:Film at 10.
LEADMALE:All right, come on, sister, move it.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I've never been in jail before.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, life's tough.
OTHERMALE:I've never been to France.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, but there's somebody else in there.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I could have a single cell.
LEADMALE:Toots, this is jail, not the Love Boat.
SUPFEMALE:Get in.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:One last question.
LEADFEMALE:Um, are my things gonna be all right? I mean, that's a very expensive sweater.
LEADMALE:Don't put that on a hanger.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't worry about it, honey.
SUPMALE:I'll only wear it weekends.
SUPFEMALE:- Hello.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you poor, dear child.
LEADFEMALE:I know just how you feel.
LEADMALE:Now you come right here and you sit down.
LEADMALE:- Would you care for a Snickers? - Oh.
LEADMALE:No, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Suit yourself.
LEADMALE:I was just trying to be friendly.

LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:It's just I've never done time before.
LEADFEMALE:I've never even been grounded.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I'm Mindy McConnell.
LEADMALE:- And I'm Louise Bailey.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi.
LEADFEMALE:- My, but you are a cutie.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh.
LEADFEMALE:What in the world are you doing in a hell hole like this? I don't know.
SUPMALE:I didn't think things were gonna work out like this.
SUPMALE:But my lawyer called and she said I should be out in a few hours.
LEADFEMALE:- It's funny the way things happen.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in here because of a silly old parking meter.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:No, I went into a hardware store, and when I came out, there was a policeman writing me a ticket.
OTHERMALE:I don't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:They threw you in jail for a parking ticket? Well, in a roundabout way.
OTHERMALE:You see, when I put the shovel in the trunk, Walter's arm fell out.
LEADFEMALE:Who's Walter? My husband.
OTHERMALE:Well, what was he doing in the trunk? Not much.
LEADMALE:He was dead.
LEADMALE:I warned him about his snoring for years, but he just wouldn't believe me.
LEADMALE:So last night I took a pair of my very best panty hose and I wrapped them around his neck real tight.
LEADMALE:You know, it was the first good night's sleep I've had in 31 years.
LEADMALE:Well, you look well rested.
LEADFEMALE:- You don't snore, do you, dear? - No.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my poor prison pooter.
LEADMALE:My little San Quentin quail.
LEADMALE:How are you? Oh.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mind, I mean, oh, the anguish, the degradation.
SUPFEMALE:But cute little dress though.
OTHERMALE:Mork, I feel so humiliated, even though I know what I'm doing is right.
SUPMALE:They took everything.
SUPFEMALE:They took my clothes, and they took my wedding band.
OTHERFEMALE:And then they fingerprinted me and took mug shots and Oh, Mind Mork, that woman told me that she murdered her husband.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mind, murdered her husband.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, she looks like Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Cleaver.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, how did Mearth take it? Did you tell him? He cried a lot.
LEADMALE:He kept saying, "Mama's in the can, Mama's in the can.
LEADFEMALE:" - Oh.
LEADMALE:- Oh, it's all right, though.
SUPFEMALE:Then he packed all your stuff in boxes and he moved in the bedroom with me.
LEADMALE:Well, you can tell him to unpack.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna be out in a few hours.
LEADMALE:I got things to tide you over in case you're here longer.
LEADFEMALE:Here's some cigarettes to bribe the screws.
LEADMALE:And, uh, here's some facial cream for an older woman.
LEADMALE:And, uh, here's a harmonica.
LEADFEMALE:Visiting hours are over.
LEADFEMALE:- Let's go, Shorty.
LEADMALE:- You got it, Butch.
SUPMALE:- I miss you already.
LEADMALE:- I miss you too, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and, lady, don't you worry, she makes a real good roommate.
LEADMALE:Don't let her snore and keep you awake at night.
SUPFEMALE:Um, heh, heh, that was a joke.
LEADFEMALE:He was kidding.
SUPMALE:I don't snore.
SUPFEMALE:As a matter of fact, I don't even sleep.
SUPFEMALE:Guard! Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, it's such a long step.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, son, son, what's wrong? - Oh, come, what's the matter now? - What's the matter? - Can't you see? - Oh, look, well, sit down.
SUPFEMALE:- Sit down.
LEADMALE:- Oh, the life - Let's look at the boo-boo.
SUPMALE:Sit down.
SUPMALE:- No boo-boo.
SUPFEMALE:Doggie bit me, and then there was a kitty bit me, and then there was a gray squirrel, then Tommy Leonard hit me with a bat.
LEADFEMALE:Ow.
SUPMALE:What did you do to make these people angry? Just this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, son, well, let me look at your boo-boo.
LEADMALE:Oh! - Don't touch it.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, blood.
OTHERFEMALE:- Hey, hey, hey - I'll be back.
LEADFEMALE:Wait now.
LEADFEMALE:You've got to set an example for me.

SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! Aah! Come on, if a dog bit you Come on.
SUPFEMALE:It's my sore.
LEADFEMALE:Let me do the "ows.
LEADFEMALE:" Ow.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, if a dog bit you, we've gotta get a rabies shot for you.
LEADFEMALE:I was kidding about that.
OTHERFEMALE:Doggie didn't bite me and a kitty didn't bite me.
OTHERMALE:But Bobby Leonard hit me with a bat.
LEADFEMALE:Mommy never puts these on.
OTHERFEMALE:- She always puts - Well, listen, kid.
LEADFEMALE:Your mommy's in the slammer busting rocks and breaking out license plates.
LEADMALE:So I'm the best you got.
OTHERMALE:You better deal with me.
LEADMALE:Oh, what am I talking about? I miss Mommy too.
LEADMALE:Boy, you need some sedation.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh, son, son, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Forgive me.
LEADFEMALE:Can't you even think of helping me? Boy, it's getting stiff.
LEADMALE:Uh-oh.
SUPMALE:Uh-oh.
SUPFEMALE:Gangrene, gangrene.
LEADMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going to go very far.
OTHERFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:Come on, son.
SUPFEMALE:There we go.
OTHERFEMALE:- You up now? - Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:This is a biggie.
OTHERFEMALE:- Are you feeling better now? - Yes, I am.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my gosh.
LEADFEMALE:That's the doggie.
LEADMALE:Maybe it's Bobby Leonard.
LEADFEMALE:Mork I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
OTHERMALE:Don't tell me something's happened to Gene Rayburn.
SUPMALE:- No, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, thank God.
SUPMALE:You see, the judge has denied Mindy's petition for release.
LEADFEMALE:She could be locked up for quite a while.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this is awful.
SUPFEMALE:Mommy's not coming home for a while.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, Mearth and I are gonna be plagued by relatives bringing over strange casseroles like tomato delight.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, I'm like Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:I'm real sorry about that, but take some extra green, looks like you lose again.
LEADMALE:It's amazing.
LEADFEMALE:Nine days and she hasn't improved at all.
SUPMALE:- Oh, Mork.
SUPMALE:- Oh, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, I don't think I can stand it another day.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, darling, I think I have a plan, though, so you can say good-bye to the bars, the community showers - and the mystery meat.
LEADMALE:- Oh, what? Well, just tell them the name of your informant.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not gonna do that.
LEADFEMALE:You tell me and I'll spill your guts for you.
LEADMALE:Mork, you know how I feel about freedom of the press.
LEADFEMALE:This is a basic constitutional question.
SUPMALE:You mean like how Strom Thurmond keeps having children? What? Oh, Mork All right, get in here.
OTHERMALE:Easy, sister, or I'm gonna have to show you a few tricks I learned in the roller derby.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mind, come on now.
SUPMALE:You gotta come home.
SUPFEMALE:I can't bear you sleeping on anything that doesn't have a dust ruffle.
LEADFEMALE:Believe me, I wanna come home.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mork, it's not easy for me here.
SUPFEMALE:When I go out in the exercise yard, the prisoners giggle when I shoot baskets.
LEADFEMALE:I have to cut my meat with a spoon and, frankly, the screws here aren't very nice.
LEADMALE:Move it, sister, you're on my bunk.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you believe I said that to her? That woman would kill me for my lunch.
LEADMALE:Oh, are they that good here? Oh, Mind, I'm not just gonna sit down and let you rot in here.
SUPMALE:Now come on, I'm gonna try and do something.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mork, what can you do? It's so complicated.
SUPMALE:You wouldn't know where to start.
SUPMALE:Oh, that doesn't matter, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna go to the capitol, start knocking on doors until someone listens.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna work through the system.
LEADFEMALE:I am.
OTHERFEMALE:I've gone through enough red tape to gift wrap the Kremlin.
LEADMALE:- How can I help you? - Well, you see, my wife is a journalist and, well, she refused to give her sources so the judge found her in contempt.
LEADFEMALE:She's been in the stir nine days and they haven't even taught her a trade.
OTHERFEMALE:That's an outrage.
OTHERFEMALE:Would you like some coffee? Oh, no, thank you.
LEADMALE:I'm not alone in this, though.
LEADFEMALE:I have a petition here signed by all 17 members of Miss LePons' tap class.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to thank you for taking the time and the trouble to bring this problem to my attention.
LEADMALE:Before you go, I would like to present you with one of my souvenir pens.
LEADFEMALE:If I wanted a pen and coffee, I would've mugged a waitress.
LEADFEMALE:I don't need any more pens.
LEADMALE:Look at this.
LEADFEMALE:I've got pens coming out the klarn here.
LEADMALE:Look at this.
SUPFEMALE:Look at that.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this one.
LEADMALE:A Ronald Reagan pen.
LEADFEMALE:It's got no point.
SUPMALE:Come on now.
LEADMALE:Come on, you're an elected official.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you've gotta help people.
SUPMALE:Do more than open up super markets and have mediocre-looking daughters.
OTHERFEMALE:There's gotta be something you can do.
SUPFEMALE:Well, okay, the only viable solution that I can think of is a shield law.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Is that the law where it forces a woman to wear pads to protect her delicate dress? No, it protects a journalist from having to disclose their sources.
LEADMALE:Uh, twenty-six states have some sort of shield law, but Colorado doesn't.
SUPMALE:However, they don't have our mile-high taffy.
OTHERMALE:Well, how about this for a campaign for you, huh? I mean, how about this? "Free the shiksa one.
LEADMALE:" - That'll work.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:And who knows? In no time, Mindy'll be home changing the vacuum bag.
LEADMALE:Okay, listen, I know what I can do.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, this is gonna take time.
OTHERFEMALE:This isn't Fotomat.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll have to draft a bill, and then, uh, push it through the right channels.
SUPFEMALE:- Right.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, you know what? - I won't take my Christmas vacation.
SUPMALE:- Bless you.
LEADFEMALE:- I'll ram this through - Ram it home.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, sir.
SUPFEMALE:And you know what? She'll probably be out in about two or three years.
SUPMALE:Two or three years? By that time Brooke Shields' eyebrows would have met.
LEADMALE:Hey, listen, that's not so That's not so bad.
LEADMALE:You know, it took me two full terms just to get this swivel chair? Then you can't get my wife out of jail? No.
LEADMALE:But my father could've.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:It's not that I don't care.
OTHERMALE:It's just that, well, I don't wanna make waves.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:You don't wanna make waves? Well, you politicians You politicians are all alike.
SUPFEMALE:I should have known better.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, from the same system that gave us Spiro Agnew.
LEADMALE:Happy birthday to you Hey.
LEADMALE:It's not my birthday.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Oh, will you listen to her? She's so shy.
OTHERMALE:She lies about her age and her SAT score.
LEADMALE:You know, you've got a funny little man here.
SUPMALE:A cake in the shape of a saw.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha! Play along with her.
LEADFEMALE:We're making our own laws here, just like in Haiti.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, whatever you're up to, please don't.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, she's gonna perk up so much when we make those little balloon animals.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, good.
LEADMALE:You know, we haven't had a party here since the police chief had his heart attack.
SUPMALE:Party! Whoo! Party! Whoo! Well, Mind Well, I saw this cake.
SUPFEMALE:It's the best one I'd seen bar none.
OTHERFEMALE:Hope it doesn't make you break out.
OTHERMALE:Heh, heh.
LEADFEMALE:Break out.
LEADMALE:Heh, heh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, make a wish, hon.
LEADMALE:I did, but you're probably going through with this anyway.
OTHERMALE:A couple of weeks without her Waterpik and she still hasn't lost her spirit.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, time to cut the cake.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, but there's an old tradition that the birthday girl gets to cut the cake.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we have a little tradition here too.
LEADMALE:Prisoners with knives get shot on sight.
LEADMALE:- I want my piece of cake now.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:What kind of filling is that? I asked for rum raisin.
LEADMALE:Oh, how'd that? Oh, the nerve.
SUPMALE:Oh, boy.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna call my consumer advocate about this.
LEADMALE:Whoa.

LEADFEMALE:- Hi, I'm Kal.
SUPMALE:- Hi, I'm embarrassed.
LEADMALE:- Hey, paisano.
LEADMALE:- Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Kal, I'd like you to meet my main gal here, the light of my life, the one I give my extra pickle to.
LEADMALE:And I would like you to meet the only girl in the universe for me.
OTHERFEMALE:Unfortunately, she couldn't make it, so I had to bring my wife.
LEADMALE:He always says that.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm so happy to meet both of you.
OTHERMALE:You know, my favorite cousin's name is Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:What a coincidence.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy's name is Mindy.
LEADMALE:Mindy, Mork tells me you're in television.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe Maybe you can answer this for me.
SUPFEMALE:Why is there no Channel 1? Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh, oh, oh, uh Well, see, uh, when television was first invented, uh No, see, the FCC has special frequency regulations and, uh I haven't the faintest idea.
OTHERFEMALE:The search goes on.
SUPFEMALE:She may not know, but she can adjust the vertical hold, - if you catch my drift.
SUPMALE:- Oh! Well, how did you two meet? Well, I was working as a nurse's aide when Kal came in with re-entry burns.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it's okay.
SUPMALE:And out of all the girls on Earth, he chose me.
LEADMALE:You know, Mindy, we must be the two luckiest girls since the other two Mandrell sisters.
LEADFEMALE:- Your champagne, sir.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, thank you, Chuck.
OTHERFEMALE:- I'll do the honors.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:- Very good, sir.
LEADMALE:I think you'll like this one.
OTHERFEMALE:It's from the Chateau region of Arkansas.
LEADMALE:"Eau de Billy Bob.
LEADMALE:" Heh.
LEADFEMALE:See, it says, "Bottled somewhere near the house.
LEADFEMALE:" Squeal! Heh-heh.
SUPMALE:Oh, there we go.
LEADFEMALE:Little touch there.
LEADFEMALE:There we are.
LEADMALE:Whoo! Party! Boom! You are my kind of guy, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:I never had a friend like you, Kal.
SUPMALE:You know, we are gonna be closer than Karen Black's eyes.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, why don't we sit down and talk seriously for a moment, okay? I think you're right, Kal.
LEADFEMALE:How about this? Famine, flood and Alexander Haig, huh? Mork, have you ever noticed that this planet offers opportunities that a couple of guys like us could really take advantage of? I mean, aren't you tired of just sitting around being an observer when it would be so easy to just step in and take a piece of the action? You and I could really accomplish something very significant here.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Really? You mean, like change the smell of tar? That's not exactly what I had in mind.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:Company.
LEADFEMALE:Are you anybody I should know? Kal, Tracy, this is our little bundle of joy, our bouncing baby-man, Mearth.
LEADMALE:- Hey.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi, Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, and he's even And he's even cuter when he's upstairs asleep in his bed, - aren't you, Mearth? - Oh, uh, uh-oh! Come on.
LEADFEMALE:What's the good of having a kid if he can't come down and show off for company a little bit? Mearthy, do something wonderful, that thing that Daddy loves so much.
LEADFEMALE:These slippers are a cheat.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:Whoa, eh, you're a little boy.
SUPFEMALE:He is so fun.
LEADFEMALE:It's amazing.
LEADFEMALE:- Isn't he something? - Incredible.
LEADMALE:Very talented.
LEADMALE:Well, if you like that, how about my impression of Gary Cooper? Why don't you do Gary Cooper sleeping in the bunkhouse? Hmm? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Mommy.
SUPMALE:Well, I'll be moseying along.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be going to the bunkhouse.
SUPMALE:I'm a little uneasy about that because of those bunkies.
SUPFEMALE:Tomorrow at 12:10-30, they're gonna hang me.
SUPMALE:I hope the guy has a sense of humor.
SUPFEMALE:Last year he used a rubber band.
SUPFEMALE:You kids wait here.
LEADMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth won't go to bed unless I show him a picture of the bogeyman getting on a plane.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you go right ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Are you satisfied with the Orkan? He may be a feeb, but he still has great powers, though they're no match for mine.
OTHERFEMALE:- I can mold him into whatever I want.
LEADFEMALE:- What about the woman? She's of no use to us.
SUPMALE:She'll have to be eliminated.
OTHERMALE:And the child? The son, Mearth, is nothing but a useless mutant, and he does a lousy Gary Cooper.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh! Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Ha-ha.
SUPMALE:We were just talking about how precious your child is.
LEADMALE:No, you weren't.
LEADMALE:I heard exactly what you said.
OTHERFEMALE:How dare you talk about our son like that? - I think you two had better leave.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh.
LEADMALE:Whoa-ho.
SUPMALE:What's wrong, Mind, did they use those little soaps of yours? They just called your son a mutant.
SUPFEMALE:How can you say something so cruel about a special boy - that's never hurt anybody? - Oh, hey, space-bro, lighten up.
SUPMALE:What are you getting so upset about? I mean, we have important business to talk about.
LEADFEMALE:We have nothing to discuss.
LEADMALE:You should leave right now.
SUPMALE:Look, I didn't wanna say this, but let's face it, he's nothing but a hefty half-breed.
SUPMALE:No one calls my son a mutant.
OTHERMALE:You should take a hike.
LEADMALE:You could have been my ally.
SUPMALE:But you've made your choice.
SUPFEMALE:You'll live to regret this, Orkan, but not for long.
LEADFEMALE:Tracy, come.
OTHERMALE:Oh, remember, Mindy, you owe me that carrot-cake recipe.
OTHERFEMALE:Night.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we'll show them.
SUPMALE:Give them your grandmother's carrot-cake recipe.
LEADFEMALE:They'll starve to death trying to read her handwriting.
OTHERFEMALE:Mommy, you'd better hurry up and get out here.
LEADMALE:It's time you get out here.
LEADMALE:If you take longer, I'm gonna start getting interested in girls.
LEADFEMALE:I know you're in there, Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:I know you're in there.
LEADMALE:Now, I'm going to count to ten.
LEADFEMALE:If you're not out here by the time I count to ten, I'll make a lot of long-distance calls at random.
LEADMALE:Like Berlin, London, Paris, Frankfurt, Fayetteville.
LEADFEMALE:Mommy.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, I'll use the old saver.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.
LEADMALE:Ah! - Mearth.
LEADMALE:- I'm sorry, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:- My tiny heart left my body.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I didn't mean to frighten you.
LEADFEMALE:I've been waiting downstairs.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you'd slipped out for a moment.
LEADMALE:I was irrigating my ant farm.
SUPMALE:We'll wanna get to the park before the winos wake up.
LEADFEMALE:- Here, here's your jacket.
SUPFEMALE:- Okay.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you're gonna love flying your kite in the park, Mearth, - and running.
SUPFEMALE:- I don't wanna I don't wanna run.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll just walk briskly.
SUPMALE:Oh, hi.
OTHERMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:- What's wrong? - Oh, nothing.
OTHERMALE:- Good.
LEADMALE:We're going.
LEADMALE:- No, you're not! Oh, there's someone following me! Mork, you have been doing this for three days.
LEADMALE:Now, no one is following you.
SUPFEMALE:So Kal made a few idle threats.
SUPMALE:That doesn't mean he's gonna do anything.
LEADFEMALE:Look at Reagan.
LEADMALE:Mind, you don't know Neptunians.
LEADFEMALE:They end their national anthem with a human sacrifice.
SUPMALE:Mork, you can stay in here and be afraid of your shadow, or you can come with us.
LEADFEMALE:- Bye.
OTHERMALE:- Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Mearth.
SUPFEMALE:- Bye.
SUPMALE:- See you, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:There's no wind out there anyway.
LEADMALE:Mork, are you in there? It's Tracy.
LEADMALE:Please, open the door.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't.
LEADFEMALE:My Mommy and Daddy are sleeping.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, please, I have to talk to you.
LEADMALE:Let me in.
LEADFEMALE:I'm alone.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure.
LEADMALE:And Tip O'Neill wears tapered shirts.
SUPMALE:If you won't believe me, why don't you check for yourself? - Please.
SUPMALE:- All right.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'll just do that.
LEADMALE:Kal, are you out there? Kal, are you out there? Well, that's good enough for me.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Oh, it's all right.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, you were the only person I could turn to.
OTHERFEMALE:My life has fallen apart.
SUPMALE:I've left Kal.
SUPFEMALE:I should have known he was evil when he laughed at Old Yeller.
SUPMALE:- Oh! That macho pig.
OTHERFEMALE:Macho pig.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh I have tried to be a good wife.
LEADFEMALE:I washed his clothes.
LEADFEMALE:I darned his socks.
LEADFEMALE:I even jogged for him so he could sleep late.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's all Oh, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:There we go.
OTHERMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, there we go.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, it's all right.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Mork.
OTHERMALE:- Feel better? Yeah.
SUPMALE:You're so sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:I have to tell you, Kal didn't meet you by accident.
SUPMALE:It was all part of his plan.
SUPMALE:He was just using you.
SUPFEMALE:I feel so cheap.
OTHERFEMALE:He just wanted to pick your brain to find out what your ultimate mission was here on Earth.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, originally, I was sent to observe the culture, but now I just want to see if Nightline knocks off Carson.
LEADMALE:Why do you want to know? Why? Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, I'm just being silly.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that I haven't had a chance to chat with anyone since Kal left me.
LEADMALE:Kal left you.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you said you left Kal.
LEADMALE:I did? Well, we both left at the same time.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:You're trying to pull the Dacron over my eyes here.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Who do you think I am? The American people? Come on, now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my little Morkie Pie.
LEADFEMALE:What difference does it make? Just as long as we're together.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Heh-heh.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:I know I'm irresistible, but I have a wife and child.
LEADFEMALE:I can't support them, but I've got them.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:I just wanna know what pleases you.
LEADMALE:I wanna know your joys, - your problems.
SUPMALE:- No.
LEADMALE:Stand back! No.
OTHERMALE:Well, the only problems I have is I really can't find a decent FM station.
SUPMALE:No, no, no, please, no, no, no, please, no, no, no, wait, time-out.
LEADFEMALE:Now, let's look at this rationally.
LEADFEMALE:You and I are married people.
LEADMALE:And besides, I can't keep this up.
SUPMALE:I mean, I'm beginning to hyperventilate.
OTHERFEMALE:Please.
LEADMALE:- Good, I just love a heavy breather.
SUPMALE:- Oh, no, no, no.
SUPMALE:Daddy, are you telling her a story? - What is going on? - Oh, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind.
LEADMALE:Mind, Mind, you know me.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing is going on.
OTHERMALE:Nothing is going on here.
OTHERFEMALE:You know me.
LEADMALE:I'm straighter than Chinese children's bangs.
LEADMALE:- Mearth, go to your room.
OTHERMALE:- Ma I still think that someday this will make a very sensitive movie.
OTHERFEMALE:No, Mind, now, come on.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:Mind, you know I'd never cheat on you.
OTHERFEMALE:Except in Monopoly when I'm the banker.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, I'm sure that there's a perfectly logical explanation.
SUPMALE:Oh, there sure is.
SUPMALE:And you've got five seconds to give it to me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no pressure.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mind, she just can't keep her hands off me.
LEADMALE:That's not the right thing to say.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:Tracy, come on, now.
SUPMALE:I mean, tell her, tell her.
OTHERMALE:Your marriage may be over, but we just got our monogrammed towels.
LEADFEMALE:You take your hands off Ah! You didn't have to take her literally.
SUPFEMALE:I have a feeling she's not from Chicago.
SUPMALE:What a pair of feebs.
LEADMALE:I am programmed to extract and transmit information for my master, Kal.
LEADFEMALE:You're an android.
SUPMALE:Affirmative.
LEADMALE:And I am also a bomb.
SUPMALE:Oh, what a difference A bomb! Hide! Gosh, it's incredible.
SUPMALE:What a mess.
LEADMALE:Are you all right? Oh, Mommy, I wouldn't count on getting my cleaning deposit back on this place.
LEADFEMALE:Everything okay, Mork? Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- You still think I'm paranoid, Mind? - No.
SUPFEMALE:Kal is after us.
LEADFEMALE:Oh We gotta find someplace where he won't go.
LEADFEMALE:- Where? - I don't know.
SUPMALE:I was hoping you'd know.
SUPFEMALE:I can't leave.
SUPMALE:My guppy's expecting.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go get the photo album and your jewelry.
LEADMALE:- You get the Veg-O-Matic.
OTHERFEMALE:- No.
LEADMALE:We gotta get out of here before Kal comes back.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah, you're right.
SUPMALE:Come on, son.
LEADFEMALE:- Guppy's on her own.
LEADMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:This stuff will all be here when we come back.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:I have a feeling we're never gonna see this place again.
LEADMALE:Come on, we gotta get out of here.
LEADMALE:Na-no, na-no.
LEADMALE:- Mom.
LEADMALE:Mom.
SUPFEMALE:- You're from Neptune? My name is Kalnik, but please call me Kal.
LEADMALE:You live on Earth? Me too.
SUPMALE:What do you do? Well, I'm an observer, and I enjoy folk dancing.
SUPFEMALE:I'm an observer also.
LEADMALE:- What a small galaxy.
SUPMALE:- What a small galaxy.
LEADMALE:Years ago, I never even knew there were aliens, - and here I am, sitting with two.
LEADMALE:- I know what you mean.
SUPMALE:I would like to make a toast here.
LEADFEMALE:A friendship that spans the universe.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hm.
SUPMALE:Are you satisfied with the Orkan? I can mold him into whatever I want.
LEADFEMALE:- What about the woman? - She's of no use.
LEADMALE:- She'll have to be eliminated.
OTHERFEMALE:- The child? The son, Mearth, is nothing but a useless mutant.
LEADFEMALE:No one calls my son a mutant.
OTHERFEMALE:Take a hike.
OTHERMALE:What are you getting so upset about? We have important business.
LEADMALE:- We have nothing to discuss.
LEADFEMALE:Leave.
OTHERFEMALE:- You'll live to regret this, Orkan.
SUPMALE:- You're so sweet.
LEADFEMALE:- What is going on? - Mind, you know I'd never cheat.
OTHERFEMALE:- Take your hands off Ah! - You're an android.
LEADMALE:- And I'm also a bomb.
LEADMALE:A bomb! Hide.
LEADMALE:- Are you okay, Mork? - Still think I'm paranoid, Mind? Kalnik's after us.
LEADMALE:Gotta go someplace where he won't find us.
LEADMALE:I have a feeling we're never gonna see this place again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy, Arizona's beautiful, isn't it, Mind? Painted deserts, purple mountains.
LEADFEMALE:- It's gonna be a great place to die.
SUPMALE:- All right.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I didn't say anything when you said you saw a cactus - take down our license plate number.
LEADMALE:- I did.
LEADMALE:But enough is enough, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:We've put a lot of distance between us and Kalnik.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, don't you underestimate Kal.
LEADFEMALE:He's got a Porsche.
OTHERFEMALE:This is an emergency situation.
OTHERFEMALE:We need you.
OTHERMALE:Okay? So don't fall apart, like you do when your potato chip has a little green on it.
SUPMALE:Oh, I do hate that.
SUPFEMALE:But you're right.
SUPFEMALE:Gonna hang tough, gotta be cool.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:Agent 46 to Kalnik.
LEADMALE:We've located the alien.
LEADFEMALE:Shall we take him? No, keep him in sight, but save him for me.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha! Go.
SUPMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe you, Mommy.
SUPFEMALE:You're asking an innocent child to sleep here in this dirt? Mearth, I've explained to you.
LEADMALE:This is sort of a spur of the moment camping trip, and you're just gonna have to bear with us.
OTHERMALE:Okay? Oh, that's all right for you to say.
SUPMALE:You've got the air mattress.
LEADFEMALE:We all agreed that the coin toss was fair, all right? - Night-night.
SUPFEMALE:Pleasant dreams.
LEADMALE:- Night-night.
LEADMALE:Sure.
OTHERMALE:And I've got this Gila monster for a pillow.
SUPFEMALE:- Mind? Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:- Ah! - Mork.
LEADMALE:- Oh, look at that.
SUPMALE:Georgia O'Keeffe's hood ornament.
LEADFEMALE:Talk about the Scarsdale Diet.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- Very funny.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, come on now, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:What are you upset about? You got the air mattress.
SUPMALE:And all I get is the tumbleweed as a pillow.
SUPMALE:Mork, we have a dollar-56 left to our names.
LEADMALE:Now, we've gotta stay out of sight till we get a message to Dad to bring us more money.
OTHERMALE:But to tide us over, I think we're gonna have to pawn our wedding rings.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mind, no.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, that's a symbol of our love and commitment.
LEADMALE:I mean, couldn't you just sell your hair? Look what's happened to us.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, the biggest thing we had to worry about yesterday was trying to find a decent plumber, and now we're running for our lives.
SUPMALE:- I'm scared.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, so am I.
LEADMALE:Come here, come here.
LEADMALE:I should've known better than to trust somebody from Neptune.
SUPFEMALE:On Neptune, Pia Zadora would've won the Oscar.
LEADFEMALE:Oh It's so hard to stay depressed around you.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mind, I guess that's why Ingmar Bergman doesn't come over and play tennis anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Five-love.
SUPMALE:Will you look at this place? Looks like Sylvester Stallone's library.
SUPFEMALE:Who cares? It's a better place to hide than Edna's Reptile Dinner Theater.
LEADFEMALE:I loved it when that iguana sang "Oklahoma.
LEADMALE:" I'm hungry.
SUPFEMALE:Where do you suppose the coffee shop is? The last thing I had to eat was a Junior Mint, and that was stuck to the sole of my shoe.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but you didn't share it, you wretched little churl.
LEADMALE:All right, let's not start this again.
SUPFEMALE:Mearth, what we're gonna do, we'll check in and go to the coffee shop, and then when Dad comes, we'll be able to pay for it.
LEADMALE:Come on, everybody, let's go.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:This is the last lap.
LEADMALE:Enjoy it.
LEADMALE:Okay, this is the last stretch.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, terrific.
SUPFEMALE:Let's all give ourselves a Hidden Hills hand for the splendid job we did on our run today.
LEADFEMALE:And let's try to forget about what happened to Angela.
LEADFEMALE:Time for lunch, everybody.
LEADMALE:Today's meal is a carrot stick and a picture of a potato.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, you can never be too rich or too thin.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha! I have a feeling this place is a fat farm.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, and what a bumper crop.
OTHERFEMALE:One, two, three, four, soon you'll fit through the door.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy Okay, everybody, let's shake it out now.
LEADFEMALE:All right, everybody in a semi-circle.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Time now for sharing and caring.
OTHERMALE:Stella, would you like to begin? - Do you gotta stand? - Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, give me a minute.
LEADMALE:Come on, Stella, you can do it.
LEADMALE:Well, my name is Stella Benson, and I have a weight problem.
SUPFEMALE:But I feel good about myself, because I've lost 17 pounds.
LEADFEMALE:And now, when I go on an airplane, they'll allow the other passengers to take luggage.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Stella.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, who wants to go next? - Dinner! - Dinner! Mork, it's been three days of starving.
SUPFEMALE:I can't take much more of this.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it's almost like Mahatma Ghandi opened up a burger stand.
LEADMALE:- Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:Mommy.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, what, Mearth? There's a woman after me.
LEADMALE:She's from Indiana, and she's a widow.
LEADFEMALE:And she wants me to take over her late husband's shoe factory.
OTHERMALE:A whole factory? Son, you have my blessing.
LEADMALE:Mearth, don't worry about it.
LEADMALE:Just try to stay in large groups.
LEADFEMALE:Around here that's not hard to do.
SUPMALE:Oh, my looks have become a curse.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork, Mindy, are you all right? - Oh, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
SUPMALE:We didn't want to drag you into all of this, but there's no one else to turn to.
SUPMALE:Well, honey, what's a father for? I'm just glad you're not hurt.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Dad, I hate to be the clichéd son-in-law, but where are our bucks? - Oh, here.
LEADMALE:- Oh, bless you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, what's your hurry? I haven't even seen my little grandson yet.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at this mondo dinero.
LEADMALE:You must have gotten a great settlement in your hair-transplant suit.
LEADFEMALE:- Dad, we don't need all this money.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, that's all right.
LEADFEMALE:I can afford to be generous.
SUPFEMALE:After all, you'll never live to spend it.
SUPMALE:Kalnik.
OTHERMALE:Oh Oh! Oh, Mind, we're not gonna hit our target weight after all.
LEADMALE:All right, now, what has four legs and ten seconds to live? Wait a minute, I know this one.
LEADMALE:Uh It's I think it's Sounds like Oh, would you shut up, Ork breath? Both of you, put your fingers in your ears.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead.
LEADMALE:And stand on one foot.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, do you look stupid.
SUPFEMALE:Why do you want to kill us? Because you're the only ones that can throw a monkey wrench into my plans.
SUPFEMALE:I have to kill all three of you and then get back for my haircut by 4.
SUPFEMALE:- Now, where's the little mutant? - No, not Mearth.
OTHERMALE:He's just a child.
SUPMALE:Well No, I'm gonna kill him.
LEADMALE:- You're insane.
OTHERMALE:- I'm just a product of your sick society.
SUPFEMALE:When I came to Earth, all I wanted to do was open a little restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:I had trouble getting a liquor license.
LEADFEMALE:I decided it would be easier to take over the planet instead.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm glad you shared this moment with us because it probably makes you feel better about blowing us away.
LEADMALE:- Yes, it does.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, really? Oh, Mork, Mork, if only you had my vision of the future.
LEADFEMALE:If only you had one tenth of my power and brilliance instead of the ambition of a substitute teacher.
LEADMALE:I infiltrated your government.
SUPMALE:I took an ineffective arm of a consumer protection agency and turned them into my own personal army.
SUPFEMALE:I told them that you were the aliens threatening the planet.
LEADFEMALE:Catchy twist, isn't it? Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:There was a draft.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:- Any last words? - Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:Mind.
LEADMALE:I'm so glad we had this time together Just to have a laugh and sing a song Seems we just got started And before we know it Comes the time We have to say, "So long" - Okay, hold it right there.
SUPMALE:- Ah! Don't shoot me, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Don't shoot me, Mindy.
SUPMALE:Don't shoot me.
LEADFEMALE:Get out of the way, you dumbbell.
SUPFEMALE:- Okay, you hold it right there.
LEADMALE:- Oh, no, you wouldn't fire that gun.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, I would.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get this back to you by Tuesday.
LEADFEMALE:Kal, I'm warning you.
SUPFEMALE:All you Earth women are good for is standing in line at the movies while your husbands park the car.
SUPMALE:- Stay back.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not kidding.
LEADMALE:- You don't have the guts.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I do.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't have the instructions.
LEADMALE:Mind, Mind, I'm open.
LEADMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Mind, was that you or the Memorex? That was my mother's ray gun.
SUPMALE:All right, you just bought yourself another minute to live.
SUPMALE:- But, oh, is it gonna hurt.
SUPMALE:- Oh, yeah? What about this, huh? Oh, your dinky, little finger is no match for my telekinetic powers.
LEADFEMALE:You did it now, Jack.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:- Come on, come on, come on.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Howard, boxing has been good to me.
LEADMALE:You didn't fight.
LEADMALE:Come on, you gotta get mad, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You can think of things you hate.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah, post-nasal drip and your perm.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:My perm? What do you mean, my perm? Oh, I'm teasing now.
SUPMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Bachelor number one, are you employed? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, look, little birds everywhere.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay, this has been fun, gang, but it's death time.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, no.
SUPMALE:- Oh, Mommy, Daddy, what's this? The feeb.
SUPFEMALE:Kalnik.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, please, don't hurt them.
LEADFEMALE:Who would ever adopt a 200-pound orphan? Mearth, quick, run for it.
LEADMALE:Drat.
LEADMALE:That's all right, son.
LEADMALE:Maybe you and I could band together against him.
LEADMALE:We'll be the best father and son team since Raymond and Aaron Burr.
LEADFEMALE:Go on, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:We can't hold out for very long.
OTHERMALE:Save yourself.
SUPFEMALE:No, I'm not going anywhere without you.
LEADMALE:Oh, bless you, Mind.
LEADMALE:The ultimate Caucasian.
LEADFEMALE:I turned him into a statue.
OTHERMALE:Well, it's all over.
OTHERFEMALE:We might as well go home.
LEADFEMALE:- I guess.
SUPFEMALE:- I guess you're right.
LEADMALE:Son, we did it.
LEADMALE:Oh, you little pooterette.
LEADMALE:- Give your daddy five.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yeah.
SUPMALE:So long, honky.
LEADFEMALE:What did you mean when you said you didn't like my perm? Well, I do like your perm, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:It's just too much.
SUPFEMALE:It's wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:It's the heat of battle.
LEADMALE:Mind, come on, I never said I hated your hair.
OTHERMALE:I just liked it when it was, well, attractive.
SUPMALE:Oh, great, so now I'm not attractive? I never said that.
LEADFEMALE:Did I, son? The other day, didn't I casually remark how attractive your mother was? No, I believe you said that she looks like Marty Allen in a wind tunnel.
SUPFEMALE:Son, I worship Marty Allen.
SUPMALE:He's a lovely comic.
LEADMALE:You know, "Hello there.
LEADMALE:" - Mork? - Mind? I'm not gonna argue about this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm too happy to be alive to be as mad as I should be.
OTHERMALE:Off the record, Mommy, I'm on your side.
OTHERMALE:Oh, those men! Whoever they are, they're not gonna be able to follow us over this terrain.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork, we have to talk.
LEADFEMALE:- All right.
LEADFEMALE:- But not in front of M-E-A-R-T-H.
LEADFEMALE:- Who is Me-arth? Me, Mearth.
SUPMALE:I'm just trying to figure out how I can get that air mattress back.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, nothing is gonna stop Kalnik's men.
LEADMALE:They think you're the alien who is secretly out to take over the world, and they're just gonna keep hunting until they find you.
LEADMALE:Well, there's only one solution, I guess.
SUPFEMALE:You and Mearth take the jeep and go east, and I'll go west and try and keep them on my trail.
SUPMALE:No, I'm not gonna do that.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not gonna leave you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, bless you, hon.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Well, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, there's one other solution.
LEADFEMALE:- What? It's very dangerous though.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth? - Yes? - Come here.
LEADFEMALE:- This has to be a family decision.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, we're gonna have steak tonight? Son.
LEADMALE:You see, there's only one choice, but I think it's the only way.
SUPMALE:I have to tell the whole world that I'm an alien.
SUPMALE:That way they know I've got nothing to hide.
LEADMALE:Mind, that's the only way.
LEADFEMALE:I've gotta go public.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, for as long as I've known you, this is the one thing I've been the most scared of.
SUPMALE:You have no idea how people are gonna act, or how they're gonna treat you.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, come on now.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, I've lived on this planet for four years, and most of the people are very good.
LEADMALE:I mean, if they can accept Diana Ross as Dorothy, they can go for me.
SUPFEMALE:We interrupt our regularly scheduled programming to bring you this live report of national interest from the Federal Building in Los Angeles.
OTHERFEMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, the Secretary General of the United States.
OTHERMALE:Good afternoon.
SUPMALE:I have been asked to make the following announcement.
LEADMALE:Five days ago, the United States government became aware of the existence of an extra-terrestrial being, living on this planet.
OTHERFEMALE:Since that time, his origin has been verified by our nation's leading scientific and military experts, who are present today.
LEADMALE:He will speak to you now.
OTHERFEMALE:- Just like you rehearsed it.
OTHERMALE:- Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Hello there.
SUPMALE:I'm Mindy McConnell, and I'm married to Mork here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, go Dodgers.
LEADMALE:Um, Mork came to this planet four years ago from a place called Ork.
LEADFEMALE:Ork is a very nice planet.
LEADMALE:It's a lot like Earth, as a matter of fact.
LEADMALE:It has gravity and oxygen and dog races.
SUPFEMALE:And now I want to introduce to you all someone who's proved to me that life on other planets is not only peaceful but compassionate and loving.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:Uh Good evening, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:And Mrs.
LEADMALE:America, and all couples who are just living together.
LEADMALE:- Just tell them about yourself.
SUPMALE:- Okay, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I am an alien, and cold pizza gives me gas.
SUPFEMALE:Um, I know it's gonna be difficult for many of you to accept me because I'm different.
LEADMALE:But, hey, I really pose no threat to you.
LEADMALE:Hey, I'm just like all of you except I have three hearts and no liver.
LEADMALE:And who likes liver anyway? Uh, to be very blunt, I'm throwing myself at your mercy.
LEADMALE:See, all we want to do is live here in peace.
LEADMALE:I This world has given me very, very wonderful things.
SUPMALE:My wife, my son.
SUPFEMALE:And now I think it's time for me to give you something back.
SUPFEMALE:You see, the universe, it's a very, very big place.
SUPFEMALE:But if you accept me today, I think we take the first step to make it a little bit smaller.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, it's a great opportunity.
LEADMALE:Let's not blow it.
OTHERMALE:I don't know what else to say, except na-no.
LEADMALE:Mork, your days are numbered.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Na-no, na-no.
LEADMALE:Mom.
LEADFEMALE:- Mom.
LEADMALE:- You're from Neptune? My name is Kalnik, but please call me Kal.
LEADFEMALE:You live on Earth? Me too.
LEADFEMALE:No one calls my son a mutant.
LEADFEMALE:Take a hike.
LEADMALE:You'll live to regret this, Orkan.
SUPFEMALE:Take your hands off Ah! - You're an android.
LEADFEMALE:- And I am also a bomb.
SUPMALE:A bomb! Hide! I have a feeling we're never gonna see this place again.
LEADMALE:Why do you want to kill us? Because you're the only ones that can throw a monkey wrench into my plans.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing is gonna stop Kalnik's men.
LEADMALE:They think you're the alien who's out to take over the world and they're gonna keep hunting until they find you.
LEADFEMALE:There's only one choice, but I think it's the only way.
LEADMALE:I have to tell the world I'm an alien.
OTHERMALE:That way they know I've got nothing to hide.
LEADFEMALE:That's the only way.
LEADFEMALE:I've gotta go public.
OTHERMALE:Mork is the most famous man in the world, and I'm offering you your own prime time television show.
SUPMALE:What? Oh, Mind, this is so fast.
OTHERMALE:Four days ago I was having dinner with a lady friend of mine at my favorite Italian restaurant.
OTHERFEMALE:I won't give it a plug, but you know which one.
LEADMALE:The one where the Pope eats when he's in town, so you know it's good.
SUPMALE:Anyway, in the bar the TV's blasting away about, uh, some alien from another planet.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm not buying it at first, but for gosh darn it, uh, I turn out to be wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, he's here with us tonight.
OTHERMALE:He truly is a spaceman from another planet and he's here to tell us about it with his wife.
SUPFEMALE:Will you please welcome to the stage Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Mork and Mindy McConnell? Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Tom.
SUPMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:You know, back on my planet, the green room is flesh colored.
SUPFEMALE:- So you're the guy from Ork.
SUPFEMALE:- Yep.
LEADMALE:Sometimes I get the feeling that half of my staff here is from Ork.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:I really don't think so, Tom.
OTHERMALE:Reading from the papers, uh, we know that apparently you are an alien, but you married him, why? Two billion guys on this planet, they're not all good lookers, but you couldn't find one that you liked, for God's sakes? No, um, it's not like that at all.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that Mork is very special and loving and he doesn't know the meaning of the word "deceit.
OTHERMALE:" Remarkable, remarkable.
LEADFEMALE:Now I understand that you have a son and his name is Steve? - Mearth.
SUPMALE:- Mearth.
LEADMALE:Good work, research.
LEADMALE:Well, I think that's an excellent time to bring out young Mearth.
SUPMALE:Uh, will you please welcome to the stage Mr.
LEADMALE:Mearth McConnell? Mork, you're gonna have yourself a six-footer here.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Hello, Tom.
SUPFEMALE:Are you ready for this, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Tom? It's super neat.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me about the stars and Uh, so, big fella, you age backwards, is that it? You're really old but you're really quite young, is that it? So when someone says, "Hey, you look good for your age," you have no idea what they're talking about, because I certainly don't.
SUPMALE:- What's the matter with him? - I don't know, son.
LEADMALE:I think his eyebrows put too much pressure on the frontal lobe.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, let's get everything straight.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Mom's a cute little Boulder gal who obviously prefers men from another planet, and, uh, Dad's a space jockey, and, well, now you're all famous, and there's talk of a TV talk show and you'll probably be put against old Tom here, huh? Ha, ha.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Not a bad idea, hey? You know something? You look exactly like our garbage man.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Tom, you see, one of the reasons we're considering a television show is we feel that it's the most effective way to reach a large number of people.
LEADMALE:See, Mork hopes to promote a cultural exchange of, um, understanding and respect between our two worlds.
LEADMALE:- Right, Mork? - Very much so.
LEADMALE:That and being on Battle of the Network Stars.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, I'm getting a cue here from my stage manager over there, and, uh, well, McConnells, you've been really interesting guests and I'd like to talk to you more about the, uh, mysteries of the universe, but I got a man in the green room who makes cities out of toothpicks and he's putting the finishing touches there on Fort Lauderdale.
LEADFEMALE:So McConnells, uh, good night and, uh, na-na, nu-nu, or whatever the heck it is you say.
LEADMALE:It doesn't matter, Tom.
LEADFEMALE:Any way you want to fly.
LEADMALE:We'll be back in two minutes, five seconds after we hear from our affiliates across this country coast to coast.
LEADMALE:That's it? What a gyp.
LEADMALE:You had Charles Manson on for a whole hour.
LEADFEMALE:Son, son.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, Mind, pull harder.
LEADFEMALE:I can grow another one.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't they just go upstairs and bother Warren Beatty? Mearth? Oh, hi, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:- Hi, Mommy and Daddy.
LEADMALE:- We made it.
SUPMALE:I was just talking to the press here.
SUPMALE:That is off the record, isn't it? - Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:- Thank you for the snacks.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Goodbye.
LEADMALE:- Mork? - Mind? - We gotta stay calm, okay? - Mm-hm.
SUPMALE:I know you feel like you're being pulled in a million different directions.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you're not kidding, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:I feel like a fire hose in the South Bronx.
SUPMALE:Unhand me, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Lawman.
SUPMALE:Don't you know who I am? Why, I'm Mork's producer.
LEADMALE:I'm who got Arthur Miller to write that episode on CHiPs.
LEADMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:There he is, the new media's darling of the day and his little pooter.
OTHERMALE:- Hi, Billy.
SUPFEMALE:- Let's talk TV, kids.
SUPMALE:I think Mork's had enough for today.
SUPMALE:I was so looking forward to talking concept and sipping white wine.
LEADMALE:You know what? Why don't I introduce you to your writers? - Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:- They're absolutely hilarious.
LEADMALE:And you know why? Because not one of them had a date in high school.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, are you the guys who wrote "But seriously"? I love that.
SUPMALE:And also, "Hey, where are you from?" What? Who? Mommy, Daddy, do we know a Ron and Nancy? - No, sweetheart, just take a message.
SUPMALE:- We'll call you back.
SUPMALE:I don't care what color your house is.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, here is the concept.
SUPFEMALE:You are going to be starring in Those Amazing Aliens.
SUPFEMALE:Now, on the first episode, we're gonna strap you to the nose of a Concorde and when you land in Paris, we set you on fire and make you eat mud.
OTHERMALE:Isn't that wonderful? I get to go to Paris.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Absolutely not.
LEADFEMALE:Very well, Miss Red Blazer.
LEADMALE:He can read a poem at the end of the show.
SUPMALE:See if I care.
LEADFEMALE:The T-shirts were just the tip of the merchandising iceberg.
OTHERMALE:I don't care if you are my granddaddy.
SUPFEMALE:Mommy said to tell everybody that they're not in.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth.
LEADMALE:Dad Now, listen, Mork, tomorrow we're going to make you look like an alien.
OTHERMALE:- But I am.
LEADFEMALE:- We're gonna shave your head - No, no - We're gonna tint your skin green I knew you'd be here.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mind I couldn't take the pressure.
LEADMALE:All those people hounding me, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:How does Slappy White do it? Oh, Mork, Kalnik gave us no choice.
LEADFEMALE:But all the notoriety hasn't changed us.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Where's Mearth? Well, he's getting a star on Hollywood Boulevard today.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, he's with Dad.
SUPMALE:Well, Mind, what's up for us next? Are we gonna end up like every other American flash-in-the-pan? Making spaghetti westerns in Italy? Oh, Mork, I wish I could tell you all this was gonna change tomorrow, but I can't.
LEADFEMALE:You're about as cheerful as an East Berlin cheerleader.
OTHERMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not finished yet.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down.
LEADFEMALE:On what's left of our couch.
OTHERMALE:Mork, what we've gotta do starting right now is take control of our lives.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I know what I want right now.
SUPFEMALE:What? Nobody can make us do anything we don't wanna do.
LEADMALE:Unless they've got a great big outer space ray gun.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:All right, you've got 30 seconds to live.
SUPMALE:- Twenty-nine, 28 - Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:You call that a second? It should be 27 Mississippi, Twenty-five Mississippi, Stop it! You're crazy.
LEADFEMALE:You need help.
LEADFEMALE:And so do you.
SUPFEMALE:What do you expect to accomplish by killing us? Your death.
LEADMALE:You spoiled my plot.
LEADMALE:You turned me into a statue and you made me miss my parents' 400th anniversary.
LEADMALE:Four hundred years? Oh, that's terrific.
LEADFEMALE:Mazel tov.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:They're wonderful and still very alert.
SUPMALE:Oh, really? Don't we deserve to see our first year anniversary? Not the way you cook.
LEADFEMALE:I saw you on Merv the other night.
LEADFEMALE:I tried your Chicken Kiev recipe.
OTHERFEMALE:You used too much garlic.
LEADFEMALE:You made me ruin my dinner party and you're gonna pay for it.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:I have one last request.
SUPMALE:I would like to die with dignity, with honor and with my penny loafers on.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, hurry up.
LEADMALE:Hurry up.
SUPMALE:The guys are waiting for me down in the car.
LEADFEMALE:I have a 2:00 tee-off.
LEADFEMALE:- Do you need a couple of caddies? - Nine Mississippi All right, all right.
LEADMALE:Don't rush.
SUPFEMALE:It's not an easy thing to prepare for.
SUPFEMALE:Hold it.
LEADFEMALE:Sissy shoes.
OTHERMALE:Do you realize what I paid for these? Oh, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, will you look at that? Kal, you don't have to kill me.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna die of embarrassment.
LEADFEMALE:- Put on the shoes - I'm trying This one? That was "let's go.
LEADFEMALE:" - All right.
LEADMALE:Well, well, well - All right.
LEADMALE:Well, you've been a lovely couple but it's time to play "You Lose Your Life.
OTHERFEMALE:" Thank you.
SUPMALE:It's nice seeing you too, because there's no place like Rome.
LEADFEMALE:There's no place like Rome.
LEADMALE:There's no place like Rome.
OTHERFEMALE:There's no place like Rome.
LEADMALE:Come back here.
SUPMALE:Come back here.
LEADMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you gotta do to kill somebody around here? "Time travel shoes.
SUPFEMALE:Ruby red.
LEADMALE:Size eight.
LEADMALE:" Ugh.
SUPMALE:I fell for the oldest time travel trick in the books.
LEADMALE:Sorry, guys, I can't play golf today.
LEADFEMALE:I gotta go kill Mork and Mindy.
SUPMALE:You did it.
LEADFEMALE:We escaped through time.
OTHERFEMALE:- Where do you think we are? - I don't know.
LEADMALE:- Get us out of here.
LEADMALE:- Here we go.
SUPMALE:- Hurry.
SUPMALE:- Home, James.
LEADMALE:- Home, James.
SUPMALE:Uh-oh.
SUPFEMALE:- Mork.
LEADMALE:Something's wrong.
LEADMALE:Maybe the insole's short circuited.
SUPMALE:Well, I hope I have the receipt.
SUPMALE:Do you realize where we are? We're at the dawn of man.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Finally we'll be able to buy land in California cheap.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:Get ready for a fight.
LEADMALE:Well, I see evolution hasn't changed you.
LEADMALE:I'll soothe the savage beasts.
LEADFEMALE:Look.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
OTHERMALE:Look nice.
LEADMALE:Nice.
SUPFEMALE:The record company executives did the same thing.
SUPMALE:Rahlu.
LEADFEMALE:Rahlu.
LEADFEMALE:Rahlu.
LEADMALE:Oh, she must think you did magic.
SUPMALE:Well, either that or she's near-sighted and has a foot fetish.
LEADMALE:I knew I should have paid more attention in eighth period history.
LEADFEMALE:I'm trying to remember anything good that ever happened in a cave.
LEADMALE:Rahlu.
SUPFEMALE:Rahlu.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, if we play charades tonight, I want her on my team.
LEADFEMALE:Macho.
LEADFEMALE:Talk about your Old Spice, Mind.
LEADMALE:Maybe you just need partial protection.
OTHERMALE:- No.
LEADMALE:- Mind, they're your ancestors.
LEADFEMALE:You talk to them.
LEADMALE:- Don't be afraid.
LEADMALE:- Uh Me, ugh, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Shiksa likes mayonnaise and Tupperware.
SUPFEMALE:- Him, Mork.
LEADMALE:Mindy, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Na-no.
OTHERFEMALE:We friends of yours.
LEADMALE:We come here from, uh, Boulder, Colorado.
LEADFEMALE:Many moons from here.
LEADFEMALE:Ah-ah-ah.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry about them, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:I think I have mastered their language.
LEADFEMALE:Watch my lips.
LEADFEMALE:Look.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:Listen.
LEADFEMALE:Rahlu.
OTHERFEMALE:Rahlu.
LEADFEMALE:They're in key, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:They're in key.
LEADFEMALE:Rahlu.
SUPMALE:Rahlu Rahlu.
LEADFEMALE:Rahlu.
LEADMALE:Rahlu, Rahlu Sometimes you ra-win Sometimes you ra-lose Now we have the Rahlu Blues.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha! Oh, uh Oh, no, uh, my doctor told me I should cut down on raw zebra.
LEADMALE:Oh, no thanks.
SUPFEMALE:I really don't like mastodon tartar.
LEADFEMALE:I'll stick to bark.
LEADFEMALE:I need the roughage.
SUPMALE:- No.
SUPFEMALE:- No.
LEADFEMALE:Not today.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, will you just keep working on that shoe? - Yeah, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:- I am freezing.
LEADMALE:I want to go home to our family and a warm bed.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, and plumbing.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, and clean clothes.
LEADFEMALE:And Frank Gifford.
OTHERFEMALE:What? We're freezing to death and you miss Frank Gifford? Don't you? If you're freezing to death, why don't we go over and pile on? I mean, that big guy over there would make a great pillow.
LEADMALE:Look at them over there, all heaped together like that.
LEADFEMALE:I feel so sorry for them.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, they look like a dessert cart at a cannibal restaurant.
OTHERFEMALE:Look how hard they have to fight to survive.
LEADFEMALE:Against animals and enemies and this brutal climate.
LEADMALE:I mean, all this tribe has are a couple of crummy weapons, and they don't even have a fire.
LEADFEMALE:Help me gather some twigs.
SUPMALE:Hey, Mind, what're you doing? You don't have to clean up here.
LEADMALE:I mean, you're not gonna invent maid service, are you? I'm not cleaning up.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna make a fire.
SUPMALE:Think about what you're doing.
LEADFEMALE:You could be altering history.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, then the Wright Brothers could be wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:The Righteous Brothers might end up being atheists.
LEADFEMALE:What? Mork, all I know is the discovery of fire predates cave paintings by thousands of years.
LEADMALE:So that means somehow this tribe lost that knowledge.
SUPMALE:- All I'm doing is giving it back to them.
SUPFEMALE:- Well Wouldn't you want someone to do it for your son? Oh, yeah, I guess you're right.
OTHERMALE:Help me with the fire.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna do it.
LEADFEMALE:Keep blowing.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna give these people a better future.
SUPMALE:Keep going.
LEADMALE:It's starting to work.
LEADMALE:Keep blowing.
SUPFEMALE:Keep blowing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you inventors are so temperamental, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:It's starting to smolder.
SUPMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:I saw this on Grizzly Adams, but I didn't think it was gonna work.
LEADFEMALE:Do you realize what's happening here? I'm gonna give this tribe a new lease on life.
SUPMALE:Can you bring that light over here? Pardon me.
LEADMALE:How's this, hon? Oh, that's much better.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, guess who's already invented fire? I am so embarrassed.
SUPMALE:Aw.
SUPFEMALE:It was a lovely gesture.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you Oh, little pooter, come on now.
OTHERMALE:Mind, I guess we'll just have to invent the Olympics now.
LEADFEMALE:Sprint.
LEADMALE:All right, so they had fire.
OTHERMALE:But I want to leave these people with something.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna teach them how to protect themselves or how to plant seeds.
SUPFEMALE:I know, the wheel.
LEADFEMALE:That's a good one.
LEADFEMALE:Unless they've already invented it.
OTHERFEMALE:You wanna teach them something? Teach them how to invent pantyhose.
LEADMALE:Very funny.
OTHERMALE:Mork, think about how often you're allowed to leave your mark on history.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, campers.
SUPMALE:I have such a lovely day planned for us.
SUPFEMALE:First, I'm gonna vaporize you.
LEADFEMALE:Then, the rest of us go canoeing.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Kalnik.
LEADMALE:And you said I had sissy shoes.
LEADMALE:Stall him, Mind.
LEADMALE:Maybe I can get these babies working Uh, so Kalnik, how'd you find us out here in the boonies? It wasn't easy following you through time.
SUPMALE:I had tickets to the theater.
LEADFEMALE:I ended up sitting between Booth and Lincoln.
SUPFEMALE:But that's history, and now so are you.
SUPFEMALE:Oops.
LEADFEMALE:Here goes nothing.
LEADMALE:Does anybody have any aspirin? - Oh, Mork, I'm scared.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, don't be, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Just hold on.
LEADMALE:I don't know what's in store for us, but whatever happens, we'll have each other.
