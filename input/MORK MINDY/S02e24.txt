OTHERFEMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu! ( upbeat theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) ( knock ) Come on in, Jeanie.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:You want something to eat before we go? Oh, no, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you're not gonna believe this, but Remo made breakfast for me in bed this morning.
LEADMALE:Mork did that for me once.
LEADMALE:It was a real surprise sliding under the covers and into a bowl of oatmeal.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! ( mumbles ) What was that? MINDY ( gasps ): Oh, no! JEANIE: Your teeth are gone.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, no.
LEADMALE:This is just paper.
OTHERMALE:I just wanted to look like all the other hockey players.
SUPFEMALE:So how'd you enjoy your first game? Well, it was kind of strange.
LEADMALE:As near as I can figure out, the object of the game is to wait until the referee drops the puck on the ice and hit the guy next to you.
LEADMALE:Then you skate around for two hours, trip people till you get a stick through the skull.
SUPFEMALE:I'd love to stay around here and swap a lot of jock stories, but I've got a job interview to get ready for.
SUPFEMALE:( both chuckle ) Maybe they'll make me a congressman.
LEADFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) I wonder where Mork is.
SUPFEMALE:He was supposed to meet me here over a half an hour ago.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I hope that means he's found a job.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what kind of job is he looking for? Anything that'll pay him enough to live on.
SUPFEMALE:He's looking in the wrong country.
LEADMALE:Ta-da! Presenting the first official Remo DaVinci wedding cake.
SUPMALE:Remo, that's really nice.
LEADFEMALE:It's for the reception here tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Note the unique corkscrew construction.
LEADFEMALE:"Why?" you may ask.
LEADMALE:Allow me to demonstrate.
LEADFEMALE:VoilÃ ! Do you dig the symbolism? I'm not quite sure.
OTHERMALE:Marriage is like a ride down a wedding cake.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you might be educated.
LEADMALE:I'm deep.
LEADFEMALE:Remo, it's just that I think it's a little silly to have a wedding reception in a delicatessen.
OTHERFEMALE:I want people to look upon me as more than a tongue-and-tuna man.
SUPFEMALE:This is our chance to be a class operation.
OTHERFEMALE:I never heard that one on Fantasy Island.
SUPMALE:Come on and I'll help you decorate the Betty Crocker Speedway.
LEADFEMALE:How would you like you tongue depressed? How would you like a knackwurst up your nose? MINDY: Mork, what happened? Mindy, you don't want to talk to me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm spider spit.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm I'm not fit to oil your Olay.
SUPMALE:You didn't get the job.
LEADMALE:No, it was worse.
OTHERMALE:I got it.
SUPFEMALE:But then I Then I lost it because of my suspenders.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? There were 32 little homicidal midgets masquerading as children.
LEADFEMALE:They bit me in places I can't even reach.
LEADFEMALE:Well, where did you get all the green paint? Never play leapfrog with a child who's into realism.
LEADFEMALE:What does this all have to do with your suspenders? Well, I left them wrapped around his little head.
OTHERMALE:As I left, I saw him going: ( In high-pitched voice ): "Help me! Help me!" Well, I'm sorry you had such a rough day.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, what's the matter with me? I There's gotta be something I can do.
LEADFEMALE:There's gotta be a job.
LEADFEMALE:I know it.
LEADFEMALE:Dressed like this, I could be a punk comedian.
SUPFEMALE:Knock-knock.
SUPMALE:Who's there? Who cares? Ha-ha-ha! Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:Don't give up.
LEADFEMALE:I know there's a job out there somewhere.
LEADFEMALE:There's got to be.
LEADMALE:Uh-uh, uh-uh.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, is Mr.
LEADFEMALE:DaVinci here? Oh, yes, he is, Father.
OTHERMALE:He's in the back.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Why do you call him "Father"? Well, because everyone calls him Father.
LEADMALE:Boy, he must be a real busy guy.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No, Mork.
LEADMALE:He's with the Church.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, as a priest.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, his job is to help people.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, maybe he can get me some paint remover.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry about a thing, Father.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna provide the best possible wedding reception for the future Winslows.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I just want to make sure they don't start their marriage off on the wrong foot.
SUPFEMALE:Just leave everything to Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Remo of Boulder.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna create the perfect nuptial atmosphere.
SUPFEMALE:See these salamis back here? PRIEST: Mm-hm.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna hang bells on them.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm gonna have this big Cupid come down from the ceiling.
LEADFEMALE:Fully dressed, Father.
LEADFEMALE:Fully dressed.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yes, uh, well, you better do your best.
OTHERMALE:Don't force me to make any threatening prayers.
SUPMALE:Got you, Padre.
LEADMALE:Got you.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, everyone.
LEADMALE:Father? Ah, how do you do? I'm Father Denny.
SUPMALE:I'm Mork, the screwup.
LEADMALE:Is it true that you help people? Well, I try to help people.
OTHERMALE:Why, do you have a problem? Um, excuse me, Father, but Mork's depressed because he can't hold a job.
SUPFEMALE:And he feels like a loser.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, how do you think I felt when TIME magazine announced that, uh, God was dead? Of course, it just turned out to be a rumor after all.
LEADFEMALE:Well, is there any way you can help me, Father? Well, I could give you a bit of advice.
LEADMALE:When you're standing there at home plate, it doesn't matter whether you're a slugger or a bunter.
LEADFEMALE:You've got to lean into the ball.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Father.
LEADFEMALE:That kind of helps.
SUPMALE:That's from my sermon to the newlyweds.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, now, uh, do you really want to work? Oh, yes, sir.
LEADMALE:I don't want to be a hickey on the neck of life.
SUPFEMALE:That's very poetic, Mork.
LEADMALE:Uh Remo.
SUPMALE:Yes, Father? Why don't you give this boy a job? ( laughing ): You mean Mork? Look, I love him, Father.
OTHERFEMALE:I I really love him, but, um, the last time I asked him to help me, he used the exhaust fan to slice bologna.
SUPFEMALE:I had sandwiches three blocks away.
LEADMALE:Well, uh, could you just, uh, give him something to do for the reception? You'd be helping him a lot.
LEADMALE:I think I remember hearing that God helps those who help themselves.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe you also heard that he can be a little rough on those that don't help others.
LEADMALE:You get my drift? Oh, I get it.
SUPFEMALE:He's gonna make me an offer I can't refuse.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ): Right.
LEADMALE:Knife.
SUPMALE:Knife.
OTHERFEMALE:Fork.
LEADFEMALE:Fork.
LEADMALE:Mayo.
OTHERFEMALE:Mayo.
LEADMALE:Mork? Hold the mayo.
LEADMALE:Did you take out the garbage like I asked you? No, the roaches aren't finished with it yet.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Oh, I'm classing the joint up so that Father Denny doesn't put a curse on me.
OTHERMALE:Oh, he's into voodoo.
LEADFEMALE:I know about that.
LEADFEMALE:( chants ) ( in high voice ): The drums, they make me sweat.
LEADMALE:( in normal voice ): Shut up and drink your quinine.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ) Oh, how you doing, fellas? REMO: Hi, Father.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I really like what you've done with the place.
LEADMALE:Really, Father? No, not really.
OTHERMALE:Actually, a priest has to kind of fib every now and then too.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, Father.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's gonna be all right because I'm in charge of les dÃ©corations.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what do you have in mind? Let me show you.
OTHERMALE:It's my amazing, new creation.
SUPFEMALE:It's a centerpiece, carved completely out of chopped liver, of the bride and groom.
SUPFEMALE:Do you like where I put the pickle? Nobody's ever asked me that question before.
LEADMALE:Laurie, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be married in two hours.
LEADMALE:That's what I want to talk to you about.
SUPMALE:This is amazing.
SUPFEMALE:I can see her clear as day.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? You can't see the bride before she's married.
LEADFEMALE:Father, I'm getting cold feet.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you can use my socks if you want.
LEADMALE:Father, I don't know if If I want to give up my freedom.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, let's sit down over here and discuss this, all right? Here.
SUPFEMALE:Take a seat.
OTHERMALE:Now ( upbeat theme playing ) Pace, pace, pace, pace.
OTHERFEMALE:Ecap, ecap, ecap, ecap.
LEADMALE:Pace, pace, pace Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you're finally home.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry I'm late.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted to buy a few things and I lost track of time.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Did you miss me? No, but I have some really exciting news for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me your news.
LEADFEMALE:No, you tell me your news first.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have any news.
OTHERMALE:Why do I have to do everything around here? Mork, your news? All right.
LEADMALE:I've decided what I want to do with my life.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's the spirit.
SUPMALE:Close.
LEADFEMALE:I want to be a priest.
SUPMALE:That's ludicrous.
LEADMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:Isn't it wonderful? After seeing Father Denny yesterday, I realized what I really want to do.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Well, because I want to celebrate.
SUPMALE:Celebrate what? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Whatever Father Denny celebrates.
SUPMALE:Mork, Father Denny didn't say he celebrates.
LEADFEMALE:He said he's celibate.
SUPMALE:What's that mean? It means that he's married to the Church.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're gonna tell me that? Wow, where's he gonna get a ring that big, huh? Mork, you can't be a priest.
LEADMALE:Why not, Mindy? They do what I want to do.
LEADMALE:They help people, they solve problems, they play bingo.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but, Mork, sometimes those problems are a matter of life and death, and a priest can only deal with them through his faith.
LEADMALE:Look, Mork, tomorrow morning, I'll take you to the church myself, and Father Denny will explain to you why you can't become a priest.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy, don't you see all the advantages of it, though? You get to wear a black habit.
LEADMALE:I can dress up like Johnny Cash.
SUPFEMALE:( imitating Johnny Cash ): Hi, I'm Father Mork.
LEADFEMALE:( normal voice ): Besides, I've seen all the movies about priests.
LEADMALE:"Tommy, give me that gun you meshugenah.
LEADMALE:Put it down.
LEADFEMALE:" And there's And there's no such thing as a bad boy.
SUPFEMALE:Only great girls.
SUPFEMALE:And besides, it It's part of a worldwide franchise.
LEADMALE:Just look for the golden steeple.
LEADMALE:Over 8 billion souls.
SUPFEMALE:There's great possibilities.
OTHERFEMALE:A little puff of smoke, and there's no place like Rome, there's no place like Rome.
LEADFEMALE:There I am on the Vatican.
LEADMALE:( imitates crowd cheering ) ( imitating Latin ) Play ball! ( upbeat theme playing ) Oh, this place is wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Real beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:The windows don't match, but it's still neat.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't they know there's an energy crisis? They're wasting precious wax, here.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, great place for an echo.
LEADMALE:Hello! Excuse me, Father.
OTHERMALE:You shouldn't be yelling in church.
LEADMALE:Why not? It's a great echo.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, I have to talk to you, Father.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't call me Father.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be so formal.
LEADFEMALE:Call me Pops.
LEADMALE:Okay, Pops, um I've got kind of a problem.
LEADMALE:Well, tell me your problem.
LEADMALE:Perhaps we can solve it.
LEADFEMALE:I've been sitting over there in that pew, and The first thing you have to do is move to a cleaner seat.
SUPFEMALE:I was kind of thinking about the things I've been writing on the bus-station walls.
LEADMALE:Oh, I've seen some of your stuff.
LEADFEMALE:I really enjoy it.
LEADMALE:"Gate 13," "Ladies," and "The Marines are looking for a few good men.
SUPFEMALE:" I think somebody else writes that stuff.
SUPMALE:The things I write are more along the lines of, uh ( whispers ) Oh, there should be flies buzzing around you.
OTHERMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:What I don't know is how I can be forgiven.
SUPMALE:Well, first of all, you have to start all over again.
SUPFEMALE:Erase that stuff and put something people want to read, like, "Nuclear energy cures acne," or "Frank Sinatra's made his last comeback.
LEADMALE:" Yeah, I'll do that right away.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Fath Uh, Pops.
LEADFEMALE:Well, excuse me, son.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you know where I can find Father Denny? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:He can't be here all the time.
SUPFEMALE:I think it's his disco night.
LEADMALE:I guess I better call him at home then.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Now, let's see.
SUPFEMALE:Where's the phone? Oh, excuse me please, Father.
LEADFEMALE:What can I do for you, my son? Well, you must be the new priest.
OTHERMALE:My, aren't you awfully young.
LEADMALE:Well, come back in a year, I'll be a little older.
LEADMALE:Ar-ar! Bless you, Father.
SUPMALE:Bless you.
SUPMALE:Bless you.
SUPMALE:Bless you.
SUPMALE:Bless you, Father.
LEADMALE:Bless you.
OTHERMALE:Bless you.
OTHERMALE:MORK: Bless you! Let's see.
LEADMALE:Go to the phone.
LEADFEMALE:No dime.
LEADFEMALE:( mumbles ) Thank you.
LEADMALE:Now, let's see Whoa! You'd think this was New York.
SUPFEMALE:Somebody ripped off the phone! MORK: It's so dark.
LEADFEMALE:I can't see You did what with whom? Hey, wait, hold on.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute! I got a story for you.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, come back! Hey, wait.
OTHERMALE:It's a story.
LEADFEMALE:It's a great joke.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on Hey, I listened to your story.
LEADMALE:MORK: Wait.
SUPMALE:Must be a full moon.
LEADMALE:Here you are.
LEADMALE:I I need a priest to give the last rites.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this is a democracy.
LEADFEMALE:You always have rights, as long as you vote.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You act like you don't know what last rites are.
LEADMALE:Oh, of course, I do, my son.
SUPFEMALE:Last rites is when you add the fabric softener.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:That's the last rinse.
SUPFEMALE:First it was funny newscasters, now it's funny priests.
SUPMALE:Last rites is what a priest says when someone is dying.
LEADMALE:Someone's dying? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Me.
SUPFEMALE:From what? From suicide.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna kill myself.
LEADFEMALE:Why? I have nothing to live for.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you realize that living is a precious thing? It's the meat in the sandwich of life.
LEADMALE:It's my life.
LEADFEMALE:I can have it here or to go.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess it's bad taste to say good luck, so ciao.
LEADMALE:Hey, a-a-aren't you even gonna try to talk me out of it? Why? You said it was your life.
SUPFEMALE:I guess all you have to do is go up to the plate of life and bunt.
SUPMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Well, I stand here and tell you I'm gonna kill myself, and you don't even try to help me.
OTHERMALE:You want help? All right.
SUPMALE:I It doesn't sound like the right thing, but I'll give you some help.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down, my son.
LEADMALE:Well, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:You have to kill yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Here's a good way.
SUPFEMALE:Wear a tutu and go into a leather bar.
SUPMALE:Oh, here's another one.
LEADFEMALE:Here's another one.
LEADFEMALE:You try and smoke a real camel.
SUPMALE:I knew I should have gone to St.
LEADMALE:Paul's.
LEADMALE:No, no, here's a really good one.
SUPMALE:You go upstairs and hang in the big church bell.
OTHERFEMALE:I go and play "Jingle Bells.
LEADFEMALE:" By the time I get to "in a one-horse open sleigh," you're a dead ringer.
SUPFEMALE:No, wait! Why don't you try and slip into a pair of water moccasins? Let me out of here.
SUPMALE:DÃ©jÃ  pew.
SUPFEMALE:( mellow theme playing ) What are you doing dressed like that? Well, I happened to run into a Jesuit garage sale.
LEADMALE:Well, actually, Mindy, I just want to be dressed correctly when we go to see Father Denny.
SUPMALE:Somehow I don't think that's appropriate.
SUPMALE:Well, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Basic black is a little plain.
OTHERMALE:Can I borrow your pearls? Look, Mork, I don't mind going to the church with you this morning, but I really wish you'd try and dress like a normal person and just try to fit in.
LEADFEMALE:I fit in last night.
SUPMALE:What do you mean you fit in last night? Oh, dopey me.
LEADMALE:You went to St.
SUPFEMALE:Peter's last night like that? Yes, but it's all right, though.
SUPMALE:I I helped this man to commit suicide.
LEADFEMALE:You what? Well, he He didn't know how to do it, so I gave him 50 ways to meet his maker.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You might have really done it this time.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna go see Father Denny.
LEADMALE:( dramatic theme playing ) Ah, good morning, Mindy and Father Mork? Uh, Father Denny, Mork has a confession to make.
LEADFEMALE:Confession.
LEADMALE:Well, uh, would you like to step into my office? I was in there last night.
LEADMALE:You should know someone ripped off your phone.
SUPMALE:You were here last night? Were you dressed like that? Well, that's kind of what he wants to confess.
OTHERMALE:Well, um, I want to be a priest.
SUPMALE:You want to be a priest? Do you think you have a genuine calling? No, just a black dress.
LEADMALE:But I came in here last night to apply for a job and I was trying to fill out the application, and people started coming to me for help.
LEADMALE:Uh, well, you see, ahem, I guess, apparently, last night, someone came in on the verge of suicide and Suicide? What was his name? What did he look like? I don't commit to memory people who are not gonna make it.
SUPFEMALE:Do you realize you could've been the cause of someone's death just because you wanted to play priest? I wanted to be a priest just like you.
LEADFEMALE:But I've spent six years studying to be a priest.
LEADMALE:Look, son, it's no sin to be a nitwit.
OTHERMALE:But if you're gonna go around giving out counsel and advice without the tools of education and experience, you could do more harm than good.
LEADFEMALE:All right, you've done something unforgivable.
SUPMALE:There's no excuse.
LEADMALE:I want you to get in there and take that cassock off right now.
LEADMALE:With all these buttons in the dark? Go! Well, hasn't the Church ever heard of a zipper? Oh! I'm really sorry about this, Father Denny.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that Mork is so impressionable, and he really did want to be a priest.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:I'm looking for the young priest who was on duty here last night.
LEADMALE:Uh, he's, uh, no longer with St.
OTHERFEMALE:Peter's.
LEADMALE:Uh, yeah, he was only a temporary.
SUPFEMALE:They have temporary priests? Sure, they're kind of like Kelly Girls, only they carry rosary beads instead of little white gloves.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Well, I I wish he were here, because I wanted to thank him for saving my life.
LEADFEMALE:He saved your life? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I came in here last night all ready to commit suicide.
LEADFEMALE:I never expected a priest to give me advice on how to kill myself.
SUPMALE:It was the one thing I wasn't prepared for.
SUPFEMALE:Well, how do you feel about suicide now? Oh, suicide's no answer.
SUPMALE:And he made me realize just how foolish I was being.
LEADMALE:No kidding? If you ever see him again, please tell him that he's a He's a great priest and a wonderful judge of human nature.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, you tried your best to throw that man out at the plate, but luckily he was able to slide into home on his own safely.
LEADFEMALE:It seems that what you said to that man last night was exactly what he needed to hear.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, you actually saved his life.
LEADMALE:I did? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Now I have just one thing to say to you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADMALE:You do it again, and I'm gonna kick your cassock from here to kingdom come! You know, what I don't understand is why you did it in the first place.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I don't seem to be able to do anything right, and I I saw the way you respected Father Denny.
LEADMALE:And I thought if I became a priest, you'd respect me too.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:I respect you more than any person I know.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I can't seem to get a job.
SUPFEMALE:I don't even make it through job interviews.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:But what you have is the integrity to be yourself.
OTHERMALE:I mean, even when it means you're out of step with the entire planet.
LEADFEMALE:And I think that's really special.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:At least I've realized now that I I don't want to be a priest.
OTHERFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you finally understand.
OTHERMALE:I want to become a nun.
LEADFEMALE:MORK: Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:( in Gregorian chant ): Mork calling Orson Come in, Orson Mork calling Orson Come in, he who is fatter Than all before him ORSON: What now, my Mork? Ah, Orson, it's been a wonderful week.
OTHERFEMALE:I've learned to have faith in myself.
OTHERMALE:That's all any person needs, Mork.
LEADMALE:No, sir.
LEADMALE:Not on Earth, it isn't.
LEADMALE:You see, on Earth, they have the bigger, the jumbo size.
LEADMALE:It's called faith in God.
SUPMALE:Do all Earthlings believe in God? Most of them do, sir, especially when things get real hairy.
SUPMALE:But how can they believe in something that science cannot prove? Oh, that's the amazing part, sir.
SUPMALE:Because you see, that's where something called "faith" comes in.
SUPFEMALE:You see, many people believe in God even though they don't see him, and they're called religious.
LEADFEMALE:Then there are a few people who believe and they do see him.
OTHERMALE:What are they called? Prophets or meshugenahs.
SUPFEMALE:Strange, these Earthlings.
OTHERFEMALE:They need to believe in something they cannot see.
LEADFEMALE:I know, sir.
LEADFEMALE:But they don't have to see it.
LEADMALE:They feel it in their souls.
SUPMALE:What's a soul? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:No one knows what it is or Or where it is.
OTHERMALE:Let me get this straight: On Earth, faith is the belief in something you can't see, which you feel in a place you can't feel.
SUPFEMALE:You got it, big boy.
OTHERFEMALE:I need a drink.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:It's not that hard.
LEADMALE:All one has to do to prove one's faith is to look up in the sky.
LEADMALE:For example, where do stars come from? They were created long ago by natural forces.
LEADMALE:How do you know? Were you there? Of course not.
LEADMALE:It's a scientific theory.
LEADMALE:You just have to accept it.
OTHERFEMALE:On faith.
LEADMALE:Well, uh Uh, kind of.
LEADFEMALE:Uh What do you believe, Mork? Well, sir, I believe that the universe is one great big ball.
LEADMALE:And what created that ball? I don't know, sir.
SUPFEMALE:All I know is that if God didn't, at least he lets us play with it and hopes that we don't fumble.
SUPFEMALE:So until next week, this is Mork signing off.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu, nanu.
LEADMALE:
