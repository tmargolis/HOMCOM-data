LEADFEMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu! ( upbeat theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) ( banging on door ) Mork, where have you been? I went to the supermarket like you told me.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but that was over an hour ago.
LEADMALE:All you were supposed to get was a carton of milk.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but boy, are you in for a surprise.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have time for surprises right now.
LEADMALE:Oh, you mean, you don't have time for the new candy? Three Mile Mints, the nuclear chocolate? They melt down, but not in your mouth.
OTHERFEMALE:Here we go, a little eyewash.
SUPFEMALE:Eyewash? Yeah, that's the easy part.
LEADFEMALE:The hard part's hanging them out to dry.
LEADMALE:Some disposable diapers.
LEADMALE:Mork, I don't have a baby.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's why they're disposable.
LEADFEMALE:Here I have a little birdseed so now we can grow a canary.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, here we have Bi-Gel: The new anti-acid that goes both ways.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, a squash.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see.
OTHERMALE:Oh, faulty advertising.
SUPMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Nader will hear about that.
LEADMALE:Now, for the gourmet with no teeth: Liquid Steak.
LEADFEMALE:A good meal is just a suck away.
SUPMALE:Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Here we have a virgin wool sweater.
LEADMALE:Ha! How do they know it's a virgin? Mm-hm.
LEADFEMALE:And now, I bought something called Sugarcoated Jimmys.
SUPMALE:Just add milk, and the economy inflates.
LEADFEMALE:And we have this brand-new insecticide.
SUPMALE:It says here, "Guaranteed to kill bugs.
SUPMALE:" Oops.
OTHERMALE:There's one now.
LEADMALE:A-ha! Mork.
LEADFEMALE:All I wanted was a carton of milk.
LEADFEMALE:I've gotta whip these potatoes.
SUPFEMALE:Whipped potatoes.
SUPFEMALE:All we need is rack of lamb, we'll have a real kinky meal.
LEADMALE:You wanted milk? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:I have brought you the history of milk.
LEADFEMALE:We have your white plain milk.
LEADMALE:We have your chocolate milk.
LEADMALE:Yeah, my main lactose, what's happenin'? Here's milk.
SUPFEMALE:We have the old milk.
SUPFEMALE:We have some sour milk.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, Icky-ick.
SUPMALE:And then the history in the ghost of milk past.
LEADFEMALE:You bought every kind there is.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Well, I thought to fit in society, you have to be a consumer, so I jumped in with both feet.
LEADFEMALE:You'll have to learn to keep your feet out of your wallet.
LEADMALE:How? Even when I was leaving the store, they were still saying, "Bye.
SUPFEMALE:" Mork, you're gonna have to develop better judgment.
SUPMALE:I mean, the average Earthling doesn't become a buy-aholic.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, I've never been exposed to advertising before.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you picked up our TV signals up on Ork.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we do, but we're not stupid.
SUPMALE:We divert the commercials to other planets.
LEADMALE:That's why all UFOs come here.
LEADMALE:They're coming here to shop.
LEADFEMALE:See? You're fairly new at it.
LEADMALE:You don't know how to handle it.
LEADMALE:You better learn how to handle it before you spend us out of house and home.
LEADFEMALE:But I thought advertising was good for you.
LEADMALE:Without it, how can you know what you cannot live without? Mork, I think you ought to lay off advertising for a while.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, not just the TV, but the radio, newspapers and these magazines.
OTHERMALE:I swear, I only buy them for the naked ladies.
LEADMALE:Yeah? Then how come there's crumbs all over these ads? She was well-bred.
LEADMALE:No, I'm serious.
LEADMALE:I'm worried about you.
OTHERMALE:You're starting to lose control of yourself.
LEADMALE:Me, lose control? Ar-ar-ar-ar! You know ( knocking on door ) Oh, it's my other groceries.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, here's a little something for you, and don't squeeze it all in one place.
OTHERFEMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:No more ads for you.
LEADMALE:Well, that's all right.
LEADFEMALE:I still have Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Video.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, and no more TV, either.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Uh Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, heavy sigh.
LEADMALE:Here I am in a media society, forced to sit on my ads.
LEADMALE:( doorbell dings ) Oh, that must be Remo.
LEADMALE:Will you get that for me? Hope it's a traveling salesman.
LEADMALE:Hey, Morko! Hey, Remo! Hey, Morko! Hey, Remo-o! Hey, Morko! Hey, Remo! Hey! Don't do that.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry about my sister Jeanie, but, uh, she couldn't pass up the chance to see her first operation.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think she'll drop by later? No.
SUPMALE:Could you eat after somebody handed you an adenoid? Ha! Get it? An adenoid.
LEADMALE:Ar-ar-ar.
LEADFEMALE:Speaking of eating, I brought you something for dinner.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADMALE:It's just what we need.
SUPFEMALE:A nice bottle of ketchup.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, and it goes well with either meat or fish.
OTHERMALE:MINDY: Here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Red Nun.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:It's full-bodied and a good week.
OTHERMALE:I'll put it on ice.
SUPMALE:Well, we can eat as soon as my frozen peas and pearl onions are done.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I love those exotic vegetables.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you make yourself at home? You really do? Yeah.
SUPMALE:That's wonderful, because 50 years ago, Clarence Birds Eye had a dream and froze it.
LEADMALE:He was the first man to make a million dollars from frigidity.
LEADFEMALE:What's he talking about? Um, Mork's really into commercials.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's only because I want the best for those I care about.
OTHERMALE:Here's to good friends.
OTHERFEMALE:Watch it, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You're beginning to think in 30-second blurbs.

LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Please, please, with sugar substitute on top.
LEADFEMALE:Please, Mindy, please.

SUPMALE:No, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Um, he has no sales resistance.
SUPFEMALE:That's the trouble with the world today.
SUPFEMALE:People don't know what they want.
LEADFEMALE:But not this fella.
SUPMALE:Not Remo DaVinci.
LEADMALE:I never buy anything I don't need.
OTHERFEMALE:You ought to learn that.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah? What about that strange aftershave you wear? What's so strange about English Vinyl? Nothing, if you don't mind smelling like a chair.
SUPMALE:It's a man's scent, Mindy.
SUPMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe there's a reason men wanna smell like a chair.
LEADMALE:The reason is the overstuffed girl in the commercial.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:I like her too.
LEADFEMALE:( giggles ) What's the matter with him? Mork, are you all right? Oh, sure, I'm all right.
LEADMALE:Heh-heh.
LEADMALE:She thinks I'm hooked on ads and commercials.
SUPMALE:Me, hooked on TV.
LEADFEMALE:Ar-ar.
OTHERMALE:Chortle, chortle.
LEADMALE:I mean, I can go weeks without seeing them.
SUPFEMALE:Days, eons, epics, light years.
OTHERFEMALE:Why do I have to start now? Please! Please! Please! Please, let me just watch a little bit of TV, please.
LEADFEMALE:Just a touch of video.
LEADMALE:I miss the little mountain lion going: ( Growls ) And the little dough boy going: ( High-pitched giggles ) And the Ty-D-Bol man going, "Dive! Dive!" Please, Mindy!

SUPMALE:Well, good, old, lovable Mr.

LEADFEMALE:I thought I'd come in and watch a little bit with you, maybe just a few minutes.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you watch upstairs? Well, your ceiling's in the way.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, why don't you watch your own set? Mindy won't let me because I'm It's no real problem, but now, I'm going through cold video.
LEADFEMALE:Can I just stay for a while? Not now.

OTHERFEMALE:Oh, come on, man.

LEADFEMALE:Not if you're a thinking buyer.
LEADFEMALE:Just be selective and use your own judgment.
LEADFEMALE:But I want everyone to like me.
LEADMALE:I want to be part of the peppy generation.
LEADMALE:People don't like you for what you own.
SUPFEMALE:They like you for what you are.
LEADMALE:What are I? Weird but semi-likable.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I'll tell you what, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:The next time the urge to buy comes over you, just ask yourself, "Is it really necessary? Do I really need it?" All right, let me rehearse.

LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, great white hoax.
LEADMALE:ORSON: What did you learn this week, Mork? This week, Your Immenseness, I learned about advertising.
LEADMALE:I must warn you, Mork, Orkans are vulnerable to Earth's powers of persuasion.
LEADMALE:I know that, sir, especially since we Orkans don't have bathrooms, but you see, advertising is nothing to be afraid of.
LEADMALE:Without it, there'd only be Julia Child going: ( As Julia Child ): Today we'll have chicken lips au gratin.
LEADMALE:( normal voice ): Besides, advertising tells us about new and wonderful things to replace our old and wonderful things.
LEADFEMALE:Without it, Farrah would just be another Fawcett.
SUPFEMALE:But don't you have an insatiable craving to buy everything? Well, sir, I must admit I did at first, but then I learned a valuable lesson.
LEADFEMALE:See, I learned that the greatest energy crisis on Earth is a shortage of willpower.
OTHERFEMALE:For example, if there's something on television you don't want to watch, you simply just press this but
