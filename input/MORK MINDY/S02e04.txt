OTHERMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu.
OTHERFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Hey, you know, Jeanie, I was thinking, uh, this deli would do a little more business if you had some kind of promotion.
SUPMALE:Maybe you could give away gasoline with every sandwich.
LEADMALE:Ha! They already get gas with the chili.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, something that would be like a reward to, uh, your few loyal customers.
OTHERMALE:Say, a discount on the food.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley thinks we should give him a discount.
LEADMALE:Yeah, say, Oh.
LEADMALE:You got it.
SUPFEMALE:Maurice, keep the engine running.

LEADFEMALE:Buy yourself a cigar.
SUPFEMALE:Here's $200.
LEADFEMALE:Buy yourself a haircut.
LEADFEMALE:Love you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what's going on here? Hey, Bick, here's $20 for that card I bought from you last Christmas.
LEADFEMALE:Love you, darling.
LEADFEMALE:What is this? It's Monopoly money.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:I don't want to pay you with that useless U.
OTHERMALE:S.
LEADMALE:currency.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
OTHERMALE:How'd you get to be so rich? Well, it's a long story.
LEADFEMALE:I'll make it real short.
OTHERFEMALE:I played Mindy in Monopoly last night, and I beat the chance off her.
OTHERMALE:( laughs ) I cleaned out her community chest.
SUPMALE:Always inspiring to see a good winner.
OTHERFEMALE:Gosh.
OTHERMALE:What are you gonna do with all your money? Maybe invest it.
LEADMALE:I don't want people to know that I'm loaded.
SUPFEMALE:I had the same problem.
LEADFEMALE:Remo, do you have any place where I can hide this? Oh, I've got the perfect place.
LEADMALE:Where I hide all my valuable potato peels and coffee grounds.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, excuse me, Daddy Warbucks.
LEADFEMALE:JEAN: I have a customer.
SUPFEMALE:Here you go.
SUPFEMALE:Well, now that I've got all this money, I don't know whether I should build a tax shelter, you know? I bought this book by Bert Lance: Having Fun With Other People's Money.
OTHERFEMALE:With all this scratch, I've been itching to go to Crab Nebula.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I hope you have fun.
LEADMALE:Well, who knows.
SUPMALE:You know, I've all those hotels, I built all those houses, but it's all so plastic.
LEADMALE:I don't know whether to invest in maybe, uh, public utilities or buy a railroad.
LEADMALE:What do you think? If you really want to know what to do with all that money, why don't you pay for my dinner? La-la-la ( sobs ) Ahem.
OTHERMALE:Ahem.
SUPFEMALE:A A hem and a sleeve.
SUPMALE:What's wrong? I mean, the service is slow, but don't let it bum you out.
SUPFEMALE:It's not just the service.
LEADFEMALE:It's It's my whole life.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a horrible failure.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe I can make you a better failure.
LEADMALE:Well, thanks, but there's no hope for me.
OTHERFEMALE:I came to Boulder to become a star.
SUPFEMALE:I wanted to sing and And to dance and to make movies.
OTHERFEMALE:You came to Boulder to become a star? Now I'm here.
LEADMALE:I'm all alone.
OTHERFEMALE:Got no money.
LEADMALE:Got no friends.
SUPMALE:( whimpers ) Hey, if you want a sugar daddy, I'm hypoglycemic.
LEADMALE:Hey, listen, I've got more money than J.
SUPFEMALE:Paul Getty put together.
SUPMALE:Hey, I'll be your friend.
LEADFEMALE:Really? That's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Could we start right away? Hey, even sooner.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you could come over to dinner at my house, say, like, around 7-ish? How about now-ish? Oh, that's great-ish.
SUPMALE:( both laugh ) REMO: Hey, Mork.
LEADMALE:You want your 5 grand back? No, keep it.
SUPMALE:It's just paper.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
SUPMALE:No, better than that.
LEADFEMALE:Throw it away.
SUPMALE:It's wrinkled.
SUPMALE:MORK: The other day I bought a huge car and said, "Throw it in the river.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to see it sink.
LEADMALE:" ( upbeat theme playing ) Mm, that was a wonderful meal, Kathy.
SUPMALE:I love a good pork butt.
SUPMALE:Well, thanks for the chow, and ciao.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, you can't go yet.
SUPFEMALE:Um, I've hardly gotten to know you.
LEADMALE:Why don't you come over here on the couch? Oh, dokey-okey.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa! Hup-ho! Five-point-0.
LEADMALE:You know, Mork, my heart really went out to you when I heard about your burden of having too much money.
LEADMALE:You know, it made my problem seem so small.
SUPMALE:Having no money.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Oh, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Mm, nice wine.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, and a good week too.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, a dollar doesn't go as far as it used to.
LEADFEMALE:Probably can't afford the gas.
OTHERFEMALE:Wah! You have a very kind face.
LEADMALE:Oh, and you have kind of a face too.
LEADMALE:Hoo-hoo! And your hair, ooh, it's so soft.
LEADMALE:That's because I gargle with lanolin.
SUPMALE:Would you like to dance? Oh, I'd love to.
LEADFEMALE:( imitates war-dance chant ) Adorable, Oh.
LEADMALE:Uh, why don't you put your arms around me? Oh, sure thing, Kimosabette.
LEADMALE:See? I never even touched you.
LEADMALE:You know, I can also stand on my lips.

LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you should go to bed, then.
LEADFEMALE:But I'd be so lonely.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Is there anything I can do to help? Mork, think about it.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I'm a woman, you're a man.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:And this is a dove.
LEADFEMALE:And here's a chicken.
LEADFEMALE:And this is a little lizard.
LEADMALE:( chuckles ) Boy, this is getting fun.
LEADMALE:Your turn.
LEADMALE:( clears throat ) Well, I know something that's a lot more fun, okay? Why don't you take off your suspenders.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Hey, that's no fun.
LEADFEMALE:I do that every night.
LEADMALE:Oh! Oh, it's getting so hot in here! Well, you know, when I get hot, I like to sit on a good cold Fudgsicle.
OTHERFEMALE:Doesn't everyone? Mork, I want you to spend the night here.
OTHERFEMALE:Why? ( enunciating ): Because I'm all alone.
OTHERFEMALE:I need somebody here.
SUPFEMALE:( enunciating ): All right, I'll do it.
SUPMALE:But do you have an attic? ( normal voice ): I don't have an attic.
LEADFEMALE:( normal voice ): All right.
SUPMALE:I'll rough it here, right on Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Couch.
OTHERMALE:But what about my Mr.
SUPMALE:Bed? I don't think there's room for the couch.
LEADMALE:Well Besides, where would you sleep? Fine.
LEADMALE:Fine, fine.
OTHERFEMALE:But you know where I am should you need me.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just whistle.
LEADMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( sighs ) ( sighs ) Well, thanks a lot, Jeanie.
LEADFEMALE:If you see him, will you tell him to call me? Yeah, I I won't.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, thanks.
SUPMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, it's you! You're right! Johnny Olson, tell her what she's won! Thanks, Carl.
LEADFEMALE:She's just won a Naugahyde wig.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Naugahyde, the wig of the champions.
OTHERMALE:Well, where have you been? What have you been doing? Nothing.
SUPMALE:Nothing? You were gone all night.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I met a lonely actress.
LEADFEMALE:And? Well, she asked me over for dinner.
SUPMALE:Did you go? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:I was hungry.
LEADFEMALE:So, what happened after dinner? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:We just sat on the couch, that's all.
LEADMALE:That's all? Oh, pretty much, yeah.
LEADMALE:There was a little dancing and then, uh, I put my arms around her.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you did, did you? Yeah.
LEADMALE:And then I took off my suspenders, and she got a little overheated.
LEADMALE:She took off her top, and then, boom, she wanted to go to bed.
SUPMALE:Well? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I just spent the night with her, that's all.
SUPFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, what's wrong? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:( dramatic theme playing ) ( knock at door ) Entre nous.
SUPFEMALE:Kathy.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ): Mork.
OTHERMALE:You know, I'm a little disappointed.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you were gonna be my friend.
LEADFEMALE:One evening, and I don't see you for two weeks? Well, I I thought you only needed a friend for one night.
LEADMALE:You're forgiven.
OTHERMALE:You know, somehow I imagined your place would be, well, more expensive-looking.
SUPMALE:Well, it's not mine.
LEADFEMALE:It belongs to the girl I live with.
SUPFEMALE:A girl, huh? And does this girl know about the night you spent with me? Oh, yes, I told Mindy all about it.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Very good.
SUPMALE:You know, Mork, I've been thinking about you a lot these past two weeks, and that night we spent together had a lot of meaning for me.
SUPMALE:What did it mean to you? Mm, let's see Pork butt.
LEADFEMALE:Good dancing, lumpy sofa.
LEADMALE:Are you trying to say you love me? I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Mork, ahem, I wasn't gonna bring this up, but you have torn it out of me.
LEADMALE:Will you marry me? ( gasps ): This is so sudden! Hi.
LEADMALE:Well, who's this? Remember I told you about that girl I spent the night with, the one with the bad thermostat? Mindy, this is Kathy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mork and I were just talking about getting married.
LEADMALE:Ah-ha-ha! You were? No, she were.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Kathy, um, I don't think you understand.
LEADFEMALE:You see, uh, Mork and I have been living together for quite some time now, and Mork sometimes doesn't grasp the complexities of personal relationships.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I'm sure you're a very nice girl, but somewhere along the way, I think you've gotten your wires crossed.
LEADMALE:Mindy, dear, I don't think you understand.
LEADFEMALE:I'm having Mork's baby.
LEADMALE:La-la-la ( upbeat theme playing ) Well, I hope you're at least gonna do the right thing by me.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it's gonna take a lot of money to raise our child properly after we're married.
LEADFEMALE:Married? Oh, if I marry her, can I still keep living with you? Thanks for the offer, Mork, but I think I'll pass.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'd like to still keep living with Mindy.
OTHERMALE:Would you take money instead? What a cruel thing to say.
LEADMALE:But then, life is cruel, isn't it? Okay.
SUPMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Here's 15 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's funny.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that's very, very funny.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you listen, buster, you're gonna have a paternity suit on your hands if I don't get $5,000 in 24 hours.
SUPMALE:Oh, listen, I'm no legal bozo.
LEADFEMALE:How about a compromise? Five thousand hours to give you $24.
LEADFEMALE:This guy's hysterical.
OTHERMALE:Well, before you start talking about lawsuits, you'd better be able to prove that he's the father.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, even if I can't prove it, I can make his life miserable in court, and I guarantee it won't seem so funny when his name is plastered all over the newspapers.
SUPMALE:( door closes ) Oh, Mork, what have you done? Well, I guess I know what you've done, but Well, Mindy, what am I gonna do? Well, Mork, to tell you the truth, I don't think I'm the one to advise you at this time.
LEADFEMALE:Somehow, I just find it a little difficult to be objective.
LEADMALE:Oh, I don't want to marry somebody that's not Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:REMO: Come on.
LEADMALE:It'll help promote business.
LEADFEMALE:JEAN: Remo Please, just Just try on the sarong.
SUPFEMALE:If it worked for Lamour, it'll work for la less.
LEADMALE:Remo, the flower, yes.
LEADMALE:The sarong, never.
LEADFEMALE:It's not like it's topless.
LEADFEMALE:Ha! It's just tasteless.
SUPFEMALE:But then, how can you discuss taste with a man who looks like he walked out of a Don Ho nightmare? You say anything, and you're the daily special.
LEADFEMALE:REMO: Mork! Hawaii! A little depressed.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa, Remo, what happened? Did Picasso throw up on you? Thanks, it's great to see you too.
LEADMALE:What's the matter with you? Well, I'm thinking of getting married.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, you got troubles.
OTHERFEMALE:Sit down.
SUPFEMALE:And you're lucky.
LEADFEMALE:Today I'm dressed like a Hawaiian psychiatrist.
LEADFEMALE:All right, what's the deal? Well, I I I'm thinking of getting married.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm excited for you.
SUPMALE:In fact, I think it's terrific, and I know Mindy's real happy too, huh? I don't think she likes the girl too much.
SUPFEMALE:Wha? What girl? Well, the one that's having my baby.
LEADFEMALE:How did that happen? Well, it was an accident.
SUPMALE:I wish you could get coverage for that type of collision.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but let's be hypothetical for a moment.
LEADFEMALE:What would happen if, uh, Jeanie, you know, um? You know, uh? You know, got in trouble? I'd kill the guy! Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'd kill him, and I'd force him to marry her.
SUPMALE:Feel like I'm wearing a doggy bag from a luau.
OTHERMALE:Jeanie, will? Will you cover yourself up? And stay away from him.
LEADMALE:Well, gladly, and why? Well, um, he got a girl, uh Fat.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:In the family way.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I think she wants to get married.
LEADMALE:I can't believe this.
SUPFEMALE:But if you did it, marrying her is the honorable thing to do.
SUPMALE:Of course, it's your decision, Mork.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I do want to do the honorable thing.
OTHERMALE:I guess I'd better marry her tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Better start making some phone calls.
SUPMALE:I guess you have a lot of plans to make, huh? Right.
LEADFEMALE:You're darn tooting.
LEADFEMALE:The first thing I want to do is find out her last name.
LEADMALE:Can you imagine? Mr.
LEADMALE:and Mrs.
LEADMALE:( mumbles ) ( upbeat theme playing ) ( knock ) MORK: Yoo-hoo! It's me, lumpy boy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm glad you agreed to settle things right away.
LEADFEMALE:Now, where's the money? Money? What money? We're getting married.
LEADFEMALE:Getting married? But on the phone, you said that That That you were gonna take care of everything.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I am, little uzzy-wuzzums.
LEADFEMALE:I'm also gonna take care of our little bundle de joie.
LEADFEMALE:There is no little There is no reason for us to get married.
LEADFEMALE:With your money, I can take care of the fuzzy bundle all by myself.
SUPMALE:I wouldn't think of it, sugar lumps.
SUPFEMALE:Don't call me that.
OTHERFEMALE:Why not? I mean, pretty soon we're gonna be husband and wife and you're gonna be my little boojums and I'm gonna be your Uncle Squeezers.
SUPMALE:Listen, I don't think you really understand quite what's going on here.
SUPFEMALE:Mork Mm-hm? I'm not good enough for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Oh, I mean, you can't throw away your whole life just because you made one little mistake.
SUPMALE:But after we're married, I can sleep on the couch again, and we'll have lots of little mistakes.
OTHERMALE:Reconsider.
LEADMALE:Reconsider.
LEADMALE:No, I Oh, you sly boots.
SUPFEMALE:You're more anxious than I am.
LEADMALE:You're already ready to go on the honeymoon.
LEADFEMALE:Turlock, here we come.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:This isn't going right at all.
SUPMALE:( knock at door ) Who's that? Either the pope or a justice of the peace.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Sorry I'm late.
LEADFEMALE:The bus doesn't stop at this corner.
LEADMALE:Hello, I'm Mork.
OTHERMALE:I'm Justice Aaron Abbott.
LEADMALE:You know, I found him at the beginning of the telephone book.
SUPMALE:He's the top of his field.
LEADMALE:And this is? Oh, Kathy, my lovely bride-to-be.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't catch your last name yet.
LEADFEMALE:Cumberland.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, like the gap.
LEADMALE:Boy, I hope Mindy gets that note I left.
OTHERFEMALE:I wouldn't want her to miss this.
LEADFEMALE:KATHY: Mork.
LEADMALE:Mork, you don't even know what I'm like.
LEADMALE:I mean, I have these rotten, filthy, awful habits.
LEADMALE:I I drool in my sleep.
SUPMALE:That's all right.
LEADMALE:I'll wear rubber pajamas.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I didn't want to lay this on you, but I run around with men.
OTHERMALE:Uh-oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Shouldn't jog when you're preggers.
SUPFEMALE:( knock at door ) Who's that? Could be the pope now.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, friends of the bride or the groom? Uh Uh, the groom.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, can I talk to you for a minute, Mork? I know that you think you know what you're doing, but I know you don't really know what you think that you know.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, you tell him.
LEADMALE:Mork, can you? Can you take a little constructive criticism? Sure.
SUPMALE:This is the stupidest thing you've ever done.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I guess that means you're not bringing a wedding present.
OTHERMALE:Mork, Mork, Mork, you don't owe that bimbo anything.
OTHERFEMALE:You have your whole life ahead of you.
LEADFEMALE:You're a young man.
LEADFEMALE:You've got your health.
LEADMALE:You have your friends.
SUPFEMALE:Your brains are a little shaky.
SUPFEMALE:But it's the honorable thing to do.
LEADMALE:That's another strike against you.
OTHERFEMALE:You tell him.
LEADMALE:Mork I am really gonna miss you.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, I hate to do this, but it's my duty.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork.
SUPMALE:Eh Excuse me, can we get started? Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure thing.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:No, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I've been thinking.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we could raise the kid for $4,000.
SUPMALE:He doesn't have to go to college.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't think of it.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Twenty-five hundred.
SUPFEMALE:He doesn't have to go to high school.
LEADFEMALE:I want to do the right thing.
LEADFEMALE:A thousand dollars! That's my final offer.
LEADFEMALE:Eternal bliss and marriage to me forever.
SUPMALE:That's my final offer.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you could ruin the rest of your life.
LEADMALE:Well, what about the rest of my life? ABBOTT: Could we? Dearly beloved I do.
SUPFEMALE:Not yet.
LEADMALE:I don't.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:( whispers ): Five hundred, and you'll never hear from me again.
OTHERMALE:( whispers ): Sounds like a good deal to me.
LEADMALE:No, I buttered my bread, and now I'm gonna lie in it.
LEADFEMALE:Dearly beloved, we are gathered Oh, this is ridic ( clears throat ): Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to witness the union of this man and this woman.
SUPMALE:We have come to join them in the bonds of holy matrimony Oh, nothing kinky yet, please.
SUPMALE:If there's anyone here who would object to this marriage, let them speak now or forever hold their peace.
LEADMALE:I object.
SUPFEMALE:I object.
SUPMALE:I object.
OTHERFEMALE:That's three.
SUPFEMALE:Fifty dollars, bus fare, and I'm gone.
SUPFEMALE:But gungabooby, I would if I could, but I haven't got $50.
LEADFEMALE:It's all in stocks? No, it's in pants.
SUPFEMALE:It's in my pocket.
OTHERMALE:Fifteen big ones.
SUPMALE:You're not rich? Eh.
LEADMALE:You mean I wasted all this time, and you're not even rich? Now I object.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I can still catch the 8:15 bus.
SUPFEMALE:Better have that taken care of.
SUPMALE:Somebody might trip.
OTHERMALE:ABBOTT: Whoa! ( crash ) Well, I'll finish the ceremony.
LEADMALE:Do you promise to love, honor, and obey till one of us bites the big one? Will you stop it? He never even laid a hand on me.
LEADMALE:Don't they call this "extortion"? Eh.
SUPFEMALE:You were extorting my baby? What a horrible way of saying you You love me.
LEADMALE:No, Mork, there is no baby.
SUPMALE:There never was.
SUPMALE:( stutters incoherently ) Shock, bewilderment, confusion.
SUPFEMALE:Why did you want to marry me? I think we'll let her explain that to the police.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:You're not getting away with this one this time, Miss Honey Lumps.
LEADMALE:Oh, uh, you know, you are a very attractive man.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like to get a bite to eat? Are you buying? I know this place where I can get a 10-percent discount.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Min, just when I think I understand you Earthlings, some weirdness comes along and, zammo.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:The problem is you're a magnet for weird.
SUPMALE:That woman thought you were rich, and she was out to get your money.
SUPFEMALE:She never thought you were gonna marry her.
SUPMALE:But wouldn't any human being do that? No.
OTHERFEMALE:See, that's one of the other reasons you have so much trouble.
LEADFEMALE:You're just not fully human yet.
SUPFEMALE:That's also one of the reasons I think you're so special.
SUPFEMALE:I think you're special.
LEADMALE:I guess I guess that means that you're not fully human yet either.
SUPMALE:Well, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's too bad about Kathy.
SUPFEMALE:I had this incredible honeymoon planned.
LEADMALE:Now we can't go on it.
LEADMALE:Maybe you'd like to go.
OTHERMALE:Well, maybe I would.
LEADFEMALE:Where were you gonna go? Well, we were gonna go to Three Mile Island.
LEADMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:ORSON: Here I am, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:What's been going on? Well, this week, sir, I learned that on Earth, things aren't always what they appear to be.
LEADMALE:You'll have to explain that.
SUPMALE:I will, sir.
LEADFEMALE:For example, the ocean appears to be clean, new cars appear to be well-built, and Ronald Reagan appears to have brown hair.
LEADMALE:That's very complicated.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it gets worse, sir.
LEADMALE:There's double deceptions, like the government appears to be disorganized, and it is.
SUPMALE:What does all this have to do with your week? I was about to tell you, your testiness.
LEADMALE:I met a woman who wasn't what she appeared to be.
LEADMALE:Who was that lady? ( imitating Groucho Marx ): That was no lady.
SUPFEMALE:That was almost my wife.
LEADFEMALE:( normal voice ): On Earth, some humans believe that they should be married before they get pregnant.
SUPMALE:Why is that so important? Well, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:It must be too expensive to take the children along on the honeymoon.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm proud of you for trying to do the right thing in spite of the consequences, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, sir.
SUPMALE:I I believe that I should take responsibility for the things that I do.
LEADMALE:Main problem is I can't figure out whether I did them or not.
LEADFEMALE:Ar-ar-ar-ar.
LEADFEMALE:Well, until next week, nanu, nanu.
SUPFEMALE:
