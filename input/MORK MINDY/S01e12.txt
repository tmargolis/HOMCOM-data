LEADFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! ( guitar strings twang ) ( sighs ) ( door knocker tapping ) Come in.
OTHERFEMALE:La cucaracha, la cucaracha.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, honey.
SUPMALE:Hello, darling.
LEADMALE:No, not you, her.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:What'cha doing? I'm restringing a guitar.
OTHERMALE:How about you? Oh Mindy and I are going nit-picking.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, don't you mean "picnicking"? Oh, now you're nit-picking.
LEADMALE:Anyway, we thought we'd go up to Boulder Lake and have a picnic.
LEADFEMALE:Ahh.
LEADFEMALE:I've got ham sandwiches and hot chocolate in there.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and I see Mork has the blanket and the, uh, pepper? No, ants.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy said no picnic is complete without them.
OTHERMALE:Those ants are revolting.
LEADFEMALE:No, they're happy with their form of government.
OTHERFEMALE:You see, the little suckers are just dancing.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, we stopped by because we want you and Grandma to come with us.
LEADMALE:I've got plenty of food.
LEADFEMALE:And plenty of ants.
OTHERMALE:Well, honey, I'd love to go, but your grandmother isn't feeling too well.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, what's wrong? Well, you remember her friend Barney? Oh, yeah, he's the one she plays gin rummy with.
LEADMALE:Was.
LEADFEMALE:He passed away Friday night, and Cora's taking it very hard.
SUPMALE:MINDY: Oh, that's terrible.
LEADMALE:FRED: Yeah, especially since Barney was four years younger than Cora.
SUPFEMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Hudson, want to buy a guitar? No strings attached.
LEADMALE:( honking bark ) No, thank you, Mork.
LEADMALE:I'm just looking for my glasses.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Whoa, you're right.
LEADMALE:I don't think I've ever seen her this depressed.
LEADFEMALE:She's just not herself.
OTHERMALE:For three days now she hasn't even called me a wiener.
LEADMALE:Why is Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Hudson so sad? Well, it's probably because she's lonely, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:She just doesn't have too many friends her own age.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, on my planet, the elders have all the friends they want.
LEADFEMALE:Well, here it's a little bit different.
OTHERMALE:Lots of people, especially the young ones, ignore their elders.
LEADMALE:But they're the ones with all the knowledge and experience.
LEADFEMALE:On Ork, they're always being surrounded by young people.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we have the same thing in our big cities it's called mugging.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just not easy being old.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Hudson seems so lonely, I'd like to do something to help.
LEADMALE:What does she want to do, and I'll do it with her? Oh, that's really sweet, Mork, but see the problem is that she needs somebody her own age.
LEADMALE:Look, why don't you two kids go have your picnic.
LEADFEMALE:I'll restring Cora's guitar and maybe that'll make her feel better.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, listen, Dad, I'll call after we're done just to see how Grandma's doing.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:I'm sure that'll cheer her up.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Bye, Grandma.
LEADMALE:Hey, they ran away.
OTHERMALE:Ants.
LEADFEMALE:Ants.
SUPMALE:Ants! He said he didn't like them.
SUPFEMALE:Look, he's dancing with them.
SUPFEMALE:MINDY: Well, I'm going to go in the back and see if I can cheer Grandma up.
LEADFEMALE:If anybody comes in, uh, just yell.
LEADMALE:( screaming ) You said, yell.
LEADMALE:You okay, Mork? Certainly, my main munchkin.
LEADFEMALE:What's action, plasma? Eeh, eeh, eeh, eeh, eeh.
OTHERFEMALE:Eeh, eeh.
LEADMALE:( high-pitched beep ) Eugene, I Eugene, I want to ask you a question.
LEADMALE:Sure.
OTHERMALE:That's one of the things I like about you.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone else is always telling me stuff, you're the only one who asks me anything.
LEADMALE:What's happening? What do old people do for fun? Well, my mother's pretty old, she's 31 and she likes watching soap operas on TV.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, I mean a lot older, like Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Hudson.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you mean over 40.
LEADMALE:I don't think they have any fun.
SUPFEMALE:Why? I don't know, maybe it's a law.
OTHERFEMALE:What do they do then? They hang out by the parks and the museums.
LEADMALE:What makes those places so special? They're free.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:What do they do at the park? They feed the pigeons.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I got to go in for my lesson.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for the information, my man.
OTHERFEMALE:Any time.
LEADMALE:What it was.
LEADFEMALE:What it shall be.
OTHERFEMALE:One day.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:( door opening ) Hey, good lookin'.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy's not in.
LEADMALE:Who's Mindy? I'm talking to you, brown eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, why, what can I do to help you? Oh, you can walk up and down my back in a flimsy kimono.
LEADFEMALE:Hubba-hubba-hubba-hubba! Oh, why I don't even know your name.
SUPFEMALE:And besides, my kimono's at the cleaners.
SUPMALE:Oh, shazbot.
OTHERMALE:But maybe you can show me something in an Ethiopian lip whistle.
LEADMALE:A harmonica.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ): Oh, certainly.
LEADFEMALE:Follow me.
LEADMALE:Oh! Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Must be jelly 'cause jam don't shake like that.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, uh, what key would you like it in? "Q.
SUPMALE:" Oh, we don't have it in the key of "Q.
LEADMALE:" Well, then, you pick one you like.
LEADMALE:Uh, let's see, uh Uh, how about the key of "C"? How about dinner? Oh.
LEADMALE:( giggles ) Well, uh, ( clears throat ) no, I'm having Moo Goo spaghetti.
OTHERFEMALE:( giggles ): Or whatever.
LEADMALE:Well, you see, I'm pre-indisposed.
SUPMALE:Oh, cara mia, you're beautiful when you're tongue-tied.
SUPMALE:( giggles ) Do you, uh, do you know "Lady of Spain"? Oh, is the Pope Polish? Now that will be $5.
LEADMALE:29.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:$5.
SUPMALE:29.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Boy, I can remember when these things used to be ( cash register rings ) I forget.
OTHERFEMALE:( honking bark ) Would you like to have that wrapped? Oh, no thanks, I'll play it here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:How about you and me blow this Popsicle stand? Where are you going? To the museum.
OTHERMALE:I've never been to the museum.
LEADMALE:Oh, come along, sweet pea.
LEADMALE:We can't keep those statues waiting.
SUPMALE:This time of year the fig leaves begin to fall.
OTHERMALE:Oh, we'd make a peach of a pair, oh I know you cantaloupe, but oh, honeydew.
LEADFEMALE:( giggling ) Oh, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Why, I don't even know your name.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, hah, ah, that's a good question.
SUPMALE:Um Hohner.
LEADMALE:Bill C.
LEADFEMALE:Hohner.
SUPMALE:Oh, how do you do, Mr.
SUPMALE:Hohner? My friends just call me "Marine Man.
SUPMALE:" ( giggling ) On the way to the museum, we'll stop by this wonderful delicatessen and pick up some munchettoes.
OTHERMALE:Oh, wonderful.
SUPMALE:I'm starving.
LEADMALE:Oh, not for us.
SUPMALE:For the pigeons.
OTHERFEMALE:( both laughing ) ( playing gentle melody on harmonica ) Ah, Mindy, our little girl is growing up.
LEADMALE:Yes, soon she'll be leaving the nest.
OTHERMALE:Really, you two are impossible.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, us? You're the one that's been taking the long lunch hours.
LEADMALE:Yes, and I'd hate for your granddaughter to find out how late you've been rolling in these past two nights.
LEADFEMALE:Now, the museum closes at 9:00, and I've been home by 10:00, haven't I? Yes, but the museum is only four blocks away.
LEADMALE:I want to know what you've been doing between 9:00 and 10:00, hmm? Well, we're not exactly spring chickens, you know.
SUPFEMALE:We don't just skip along the sidewalk.
SUPMALE:Why are you being so secretive about all this? Well, I think a person should keep one's personal life personal.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Who's the one that always wants to know every last detail when I go on a date, hmm? Right.
LEADMALE:Turnabout is fair play, so tell us everything.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, so far, we have gone to the museum.
LEADMALE:And? Uh-huh? And to the park, to feed the pigeons.
LEADFEMALE:And what else have you been doing? Dad, she doesn't have to answer that question.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that's all right, dear, I'll answer him.
LEADMALE:None of your business, Fredzo.
LEADMALE:Isn't that nice, she's back to normal.
LEADFEMALE:Even if she is hiding something.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think it's wonderful.
LEADMALE:You know, Grandma, you've been like a new woman these last few days.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? Oh, absolutely.
SUPFEMALE:And Mindy and I are dying to meet the man who's responsible.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it just so happens he's coming to take me to lunch.
SUPFEMALE:Lunch? Good grief, my chicken potpie.
LEADFEMALE:You know, now I might not know what I'm talking about, but listen to your heart.
LEADMALE:You know, sometimes when you listen to your head, logic gets in the way of things.
SUPMALE:You're right you don't know what you're talking about.
SUPMALE:I know I'm meddling, but I just want what's right for you and Bill.
LEADMALE:Oh, everything's fine dear.
LEADFEMALE:Only there's something about him.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I know, I know.
LEADMALE:I feel the same way about John Travolta.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No dear, what I mean is, there's something kind of, well, familiar about him.
OTHERMALE:( knocking on door ) Oh, that's probably Bill now.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go get my coat.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you must be Bill.
OTHERMALE:I'm Mindy, Cora's granddaughter.
LEADMALE:Oh, charmed.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Dad, this is Bill.
SUPMALE:Take a hike.
LEADMALE:( honking bark ) Just kidding.
SUPFEMALE:You know something? You've made my mother-in-law very happy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, she's like a kid again, and we really want to thank you for that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, since I've made you both so happy, and you don't mind what's happening between Cora and me, I want to share with you a little secret.
OTHERMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:Where did you hear that? On Ork, I'm known as Mork.
OTHERMALE:( honking bark ) I'm ready, Bill.
LEADFEMALE:Did-did you have a nice chat? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:And I hope that-that Bill and I get a chance to chat again.
SUPFEMALE:Real soon.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADMALE:Looks like I'm up the big creek without locomotion.
OTHERMALE:( television plays quietly ) ( door closing ) Hold it right there, Casanova.
SUPMALE:Casanova? I've heard of supernova, Chevy Nova, bossa nova ( honking bark ) And you're not going to get out of this one by acting dumb.
LEADMALE:But I wasn't acting.
SUPMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Hudson and I had a wonderful time today.
LEADFEMALE:We started off by escorting a Boy Scout across the street.
SUPMALE:We had to drag him away from his mother to do it.
LEADFEMALE:Then we played chicken with kids on skate boards.
LEADMALE:Finally, we inched our way up Main Street.
LEADFEMALE:Backed up traffic all the way to Utah.
SUPMALE:We were real scamps.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, how could you do such a thing? Oh, change my age? With my Orkan age machine.
LEADMALE:I set the controls for senile, subtract two.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not talking about the mechanics of what you did.
SUPMALE:I want to know why you did such a horrible thing to Grandma.
SUPFEMALE:How could it be horrible when it makes her so happy? She's only happy because she thinks that you are an old man.
LEADMALE:But when I use my age machine, I am an old man.
LEADFEMALE:You're being unfair to my grandmother.
LEADFEMALE:How could it be unfair? She was sad, I made her happy.
LEADFEMALE:Therefore, how can you call it unfair? What if she falls in love with you? Now, you certainly aren't going to marry her, and that might break her heart.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you see, you could be doing more harm than good? Uh-oh.
LEADMALE:Sudden realization.
SUPMALE:Mork the Good is suddenly Mork the Bozo.
SUPFEMALE:Better call a travel agent and book a heavy guilt trip.
SUPMALE:How could I do such a dumb thing? Oh, Mork, your intentions were good.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but there's a saying on Ork.
LEADFEMALE:"The road to Earth is paved with good intentions.
LEADFEMALE:" I'm a real nimnul.
LEADMALE:( nasally groan ) To my face! But how can I solve the problem, though? Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Hudson and I have a date tomorrow night.
SUPFEMALE:I guess you're just going to have to break up.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm already pretty broken up right now.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you're going to have to tell her that you're not going to see her anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Oh boy, and is that going to be hard.
LEADFEMALE:I think she really likes that old man.
LEADFEMALE:Eugene I thought you'd never get here.
SUPFEMALE:What's up, Mork? I need to ask your advice again.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do the best I can, but you got to understand, I have my limitations.
SUPFEMALE:I'm only ten years old.
LEADMALE:You're the only one I can ask.
LEADMALE:What about Dear Abby? She knows everything.
OTHERMALE:I've read her advice, and how can you trust a woman who begins her letters, "Dear Puzzled?" Okay, lay it on me.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Let's say someone likes you very much, and you want to end the relationship? How do you do it? Tell them to take a hike.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Effective, but cruel.
SUPMALE:How do you do it if you don't want to hurt their feelings? Mork, there must be 50 ways to leave your lover.
SUPFEMALE:But I only need seven or eight.
LEADFEMALE:Lay it on me, my main munchkin.
SUPFEMALE:Well, one is, you slip out the back, Jack.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:"Slip back, Jack.
SUPMALE:" Make a new plan, Stan.
LEADMALE:Uh plan, Stan.
LEADFEMALE:Just drop off the key, Lee.
LEADMALE:Key Lee? Oh, Chinese wisdom.
LEADFEMALE:( speaking Chinese ) And get yourself free.
LEADMALE:Munchkin, you are wise beyond your height.
LEADMALE:Well, one thing you got to remember: Don't let those chicks railroad you into anything.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Funny planet, where chickens run the railroad.
LEADMALE:Boy, I certainly hope Mork can bring this off.
LEADMALE:Oh, I know he can do it.
SUPFEMALE:I just hope he doesn't break Grandma's heart.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm, Bill isn't here yet.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you look very nice tonight, Cora.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, your hair looks so pretty.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, I just washed it.
LEADFEMALE:( laughter, knock at door ) Oh, that must be Bill.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'll get that.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hello.
SUPFEMALE:Guacamole, SeÃ±orita.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, none for you until you pluck your hand.
SUPFEMALE:( laughs ) Oh, hello, Bill.
OTHERMALE:Oh, sweet one.
OTHERFEMALE:You better make this good.
SUPFEMALE:No pressure.
LEADMALE:Um, well, I, uh, guess I'll go, uh, practice my trombone solo.
LEADMALE:I'll help.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Here, Bill, come on, sit down.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, aren't those lovely! Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Um Uh, Bill There's something I want to There's something I have to s ( laughs ) Psychic.
OTHERMALE:Yes, age before beauty.
LEADMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:Pearls before swine.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, go ahead.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Kay-o.
LEADMALE:Cora, there's something I have to say to you, and I'll try and make it as quick and painless as possible.
LEADFEMALE:The-The painless is easy.
LEADMALE:At my age, the quick is the hard part.
LEADFEMALE:( high-pitched laugh ) Mm.
LEADMALE:Cora, after careful consideration, I've decided to slip out my back, Jackson.
LEADMALE:Which is to say, I'm going to make a new plan, Chuck.
LEADFEMALE:Which includes dropping off the key.
LEADMALE:In summation, I'm going to get myself free.
SUPFEMALE:What I'm trying to say, Cora, is, this is hello.
LEADFEMALE:I-I haven't understood a word you just said.
LEADMALE:I should have asked him for the other 46 ways.
LEADMALE:Never mind.
LEADMALE:Come and sit down, because it's my turn to talk.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Now, first of all, I want to thank you for helping me through a very rough time.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, rough time? About Oh.
LEADFEMALE:And the other thing I want to tell you is, I know who you are, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Shazbot! How did you find me out? Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:If you were really old, the kay-o would have been followed by a pectate.
LEADMALE:I'm-I'm a real nimnul then.
LEADFEMALE:Oh no, you're not.
LEADFEMALE:You're wonderful.
LEADMALE:( laughs ) I really began to suspect that day we went to the museum.
SUPMALE:Remember that piece of art work that you liked? Oh, yes.
OTHERFEMALE:That lovely metallic sculpture.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:That was an air conditioner.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:And then last night when we were lost, you asked directions from a pine tree.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:He got us there, didn't he? ( laughs ) ( high-pitched laugh ) But only Mork could do those things.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Well, I-I guess you don't like me anymore.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, how can you say that? Of course I like you.
SUPMALE:Why, I-I like you more than ever.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you realize you you snapped me out of a blue funk? You've made me realize that I-I have a family that-that cares about me, and and a good job, and-and lots of friends of all ages.
SUPFEMALE:I'll always be your friend, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Hudson.
SUPFEMALE:( laughs ) Why don't you call me Grandma? Kay-o, and hold the pectate.
OTHERMALE:( laughs ) But you know, there's one thing that still bothers me.
LEADMALE:Last night when I tweaked your cheek, I did it to see if you were wearing makeup.
LEADFEMALE:And you weren't.
SUPMALE:It's as if you really have become an old man.
SUPMALE:Temporarily, I am.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:There's no way on Earth you could do that.
SUPFEMALE:You're beginning to get the idea.
LEADMALE:Cora, there's something I have to tell you, and you better take this one sitting down.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:( squeaks ): Oh! Cora, I have to tell you something 'cause I respect you, 'cause you're getting too close to hide it anymore.
SUPFEMALE:I'm from another planet.
OTHERMALE:( high-pitched eerie humming ) I'm an alien being.
SUPFEMALE:Nanu.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you want to hear something weird? Lay it on me.
LEADFEMALE:I believe you.
LEADFEMALE:( high-pitched ): Aha! Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Why, I should have known when you when you carved our initials on that tree with-with your finger.
LEADMALE:I can drink with the sucker, too! Oh, what a relief.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, ever since you moved in with Mindy, I was seeing things that, well, made me think my mind was going.
LEADMALE:But now, well, of course, it's so simple.
SUPFEMALE:A man from outer space.
LEADFEMALE:You accept it so easily.
SUPMALE:Most people just look at me and say, "Bull!" ( high-pitched utterance ) Oh, Mork, I've been around a long time.
LEADMALE:I've seen the age of the automobile and radio and talking movies, and I've seen a man walk on the moon.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if we can go there, there's no reason you can't come here.
LEADMALE:Then I can return back to my normal age, and you'll still be my friend? Oh, of course.
LEADMALE:Let's shake.
LEADFEMALE:( goofy growling ) ( high-pitched laugh ) ( laughs ) But there's one other thing, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:If you can make yourself old, could you make another person young? No.
LEADMALE:Shazbot! ( high-pitched laugh ) ( laughter ) Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Ziz, bah, ziz, bah, ziz, bah ORSON: What are you doing? Push-downs.
LEADMALE:It's a common form of Earth exercise.
LEADMALE:Here's another one.
LEADMALE:We must, we must, we must build up the bust.
LEADMALE:Why this sudden interest in exercise? Well, I aged myself.
LEADFEMALE:I'm still a little stiff.
SUPMALE:You aged yourself? That's a cheap way to get respect.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, it's different here, Orson.
LEADMALE:Here the young people get all the attention.
LEADFEMALE:What do young people know? They don't have the experience.
LEADFEMALE:That doesn't make sense.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:I don't understand it myself.
LEADFEMALE:Everything else here gets more valuable as it gets older wine, cheese, furniture, coins.
LEADMALE:Everything except people.
LEADMALE:Here they ignore their ancient ones, Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:They don't do anything nice for them? Well, they do one nice thing.
LEADFEMALE:They fix their income.
LEADMALE:But why do they treat their elders like that? Unlike us, as they get older, their bodies fall into a state of disrepair.
LEADMALE:The first thing to go is their hearing.
SUPFEMALE:What? ( louder ): The first thing to go is their hearing.
OTHERFEMALE:Why is that, Mork? Well, I have a theory about that.
LEADMALE:I feel it's because no one asks them anything.
LEADFEMALE:Such a waste.
OTHERFEMALE:This is Mork, signing off until next week.
LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.
SUPFEMALE:
