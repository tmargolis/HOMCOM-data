OTHERMALE:Good luck.
SUPMALE:Don't worry, we'll visit you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, kid, break a larynx.
OTHERMALE:Ha! Thanks.
SUPMALE:Don't worry, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:When your tonsils are out, I'll whittle you wooden tonsils, and put a scarecrow on your tongue to scare the woodpeckers.

LEADMALE:Argh, argh, argh! Ha-ha-ha! Thank you.
SUPMALE:( Laughing ) Well, uh, are you fixed yet? ( laughs ) Is that what you're in here for? I had my cat fixed, and he's never been the same since.
LEADMALE:No, I'm only having my tonsils out.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's what my mother said they were doing to the cat.
SUPMALE:The operation isn't until tomorrow.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Susie, this is Mork.

LEADFEMALE:I mean, she told me she had the best doctor.
LEADMALE:Well, my mom told me I had the best doctor.
LEADFEMALE:Oh if everyone has the best doctor, then where do all the dead people come from? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:Maybe the stork brings 'em.
LEADMALE:Is this your first time in the hospital? No, it's my second.
LEADFEMALE:The first time I was born.
SUPMALE:What are you in for now? I did a dumb thing.
SUPMALE:I swallowed my bubble pipe.
SUPMALE:How'd you do that? Well, you see, it's like this.
LEADMALE:I was jumping rope and then It wasn't a pretty picture.
SUPFEMALE:Now I'm all full of bubbles.

LEADMALE:No, no way.
LEADFEMALE:I saw Alien.

SUPMALE:She might get her liver caught in her pantyhose.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sure they'll put back everything important.
OTHERMALE:Besides, it won't hurt.
LEADMALE:They knock you out first.
LEADMALE:Who does? The guys with the masks.
LEADFEMALE:Masks? Whoa, kemosabe.
SUPFEMALE:Why do they do that? Maybe they don't like you to see who goofs up.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:( Door opens ) Oh, are you still here? Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:They are goofy.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm here and she doesn't even know it.

OTHERFEMALE:Are you the administrator? Yes, I am.
LEADFEMALE:Well, here it is.
LEADMALE:You want it, you got it.
SUPMALE:A dollar bill? I talked to everyone in the hospital.
OTHERFEMALE:They say the buck stops here.
SUPFEMALE:Sir Calm down.
SUPMALE:We're not going to get anywhere if you don't speak slowly and clearly.
LEADMALE:( slowly ): Yes, I think you're right.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, of course.
SUPFEMALE:Now, what seems to be the problem? ( babbles ) Wait, wait, wait.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know what you're talking about.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I brought my friend Mindy here for a simple operation and now she's gone.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sure we did all we could.
LEADMALE:Well, no, she hasn't gone belly-up.
SUPFEMALE:Sh-she's just gone.
LEADFEMALE:She's disappeared, lost.
LEADFEMALE:We lost a patient? Well, heh, she must be somewhere in the building.
SUPFEMALE:How far can she get in bare feet and a gown that opens down the back? I'm sure everything will be fine.
LEADMALE:Really? Oh, really, yes.
LEADMALE:Miss Chayefsky, when you get time, would you just get our lawyers on the phone? Why don't you just say the eagle has landed.
OTHERFEMALE:CHAYEFSKY: Again? Ixnay.
LEADMALE:Aren't you gonna do something? Organize a posse, get out the tonsil-sniffing dogs, things like that? Oh, in good time.
SUPMALE:Uh, but before we get started, there is a little paperwork to, uh, take care of.
LEADMALE:Oh, here.
SUPMALE:Would you just sign this form, please? What is this, a missing persons form? Well, not exactly.
LEADFEMALE:It's just a formality which basically says that, uh, no matter what's happened, the hospital isn't held responsible.
SUPMALE:But you are responsible.
LEADFEMALE:She didn't lose herself.
SUPMALE:Uh, well, I don't blame you for being upset, but these things happen.
LEADMALE:I mean, this is a very big place.
LEADMALE:We have a lot of halls Oh, you're not kidding.
SUPMALE:A lot of wards.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's like a maze.
SUPMALE:Here a ward, there a ward, everywhere a ward ward.
LEADFEMALE:And there are pages: "Calling Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:" He doesn't answer his calls.
LEADFEMALE:The doctors are missing too, aren't they? Now, son.
LEADMALE:Try to see this from my point of view, will you? They don't give me enough staff, they don't give me enough money.
LEADMALE:All they give me is the challenge to help people.
OTHERFEMALE:What about finding my friend? Now you have a challenge too, haven't you? But before you go, would you sign this form? I can't help you until you do.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna leave her lost until I let you off the hook? Hey, fella, I don't make the rules.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? All right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm taking this with me, and this buck's not gonna stop until I find Mindy.
SUPMALE:You can't find her now.
LEADMALE:Visiting hours are over.
LEADMALE:Well, but rescuing hours have just begun.
LEADMALE:Well, what about my form? Take your form and file it.
LEADMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) You're in your room, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:McDonald.
SUPFEMALE:McDonald? Now, let's take another one of these little pinkie drinkies and then we can rest.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I'm too tired to rest.
LEADFEMALE:I don't feel good.
SUPFEMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Here you go.
LEADFEMALE:Now, soon you're going to have that brain operation and then your headaches will just disappear.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you can lie back and rest.
SUPFEMALE:Hee-hee! Whew, I'm starting to feel better already.
LEADFEMALE:( both laugh ) Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:Brain surgery isn't as bad as it sounds.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, it is noisy, though.
SUPMALE:Oh, hello, doctor.
LEADMALE:Hello there, sickie.
LEADMALE:Doctor, I hate to complain, but nobody came by this afternoon to change my dressing.
SUPMALE:Oh, dressing, are you kidding? That gown is you.
LEADMALE:It goes perfectly with that hat.
LEADFEMALE:All you need now is some feathers, some rhinestones and nine tana leaves.
OTHERFEMALE:Doctor, you have a very funny bedside manner.
LEADFEMALE:I believe that a good doctor leaves his patient in stitches.
LEADFEMALE:Har-har-har! I used to love a good laugh.
LEADMALE:Oh, doctor, you know what? What? ( mouths ): Oh.
LEADMALE:Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, you're awake.
OTHERMALE:Mmm, mmm, mmm.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha! Actually, I think this is the best type of physical therapy.
LEADFEMALE:It gives the patients something to live for.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Miss McConnell, we'll have you out of here in a "fribbet.
LEADMALE:" A fribbet? Yes, a medical term meaning a surrey with a fringe on top.
SUPFEMALE:That girl's name isn't McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:It's McDonald.
LEADFEMALE:No, my dear lady, I'm a doctor.
LEADMALE:Don't make mistakes unless it's a matter of life and death or a bill.
LEADMALE:But the nurse who was just here said that's Mrs.
LEADMALE:McDonald.
SUPMALE:She's in here for brain surgery.
OTHERMALE:No, no, she's in here to have her tonsils out.
SUPMALE:I guess it depends on how deep they drill.
OTHERMALE:Yeah Mindy! Min.
LEADMALE:Hello, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind Woo-hoo! ( giggling ) Oh, no.
LEADMALE:They got you too.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mind.
LEADMALE:All my life I've been getting you into trouble.
LEADMALE:Now I've gotten you in the biggest trouble and there's nothing I can do.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, come on, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Mind.
SUPMALE:Here we go, here we go.
LEADMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! Woo! ( laughing ) That's all physical therapy.
LEADMALE:Mindy.
LEADMALE:Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, here we go.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay, whoa, make a wish.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
SUPMALE:There we go.
LEADMALE:No, bad view.
LEADMALE:Okay, Mind, come on ( Mindy laughing, Mork grunting ) Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Mind Doctor, what are you doing? I was just checking for lumps.
LEADFEMALE:Okay We have to get this patient out of here right away.
SUPFEMALE:Nonsense, that patient is having brain surgery in two hours.
OTHERMALE:You haven't done anything to her yet? Of course not.
SUPMALE:I just came in to shave her head.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Don't you shave one hair on her chin.
OTHERFEMALE:Mindy, Mindy Hello.
SUPMALE:Mindy, Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:No, Mindy is me.
LEADFEMALE:What's up, doc? ( laughs hysterically ) Min.
LEADFEMALE:Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mind Oh.
SUPMALE:( whispers ): Oh, Mind, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:It's me, Mork.
LEADMALE:I dressed like this 'cause I was looking for you.
SUPMALE:Well, I think that I'm over there.
LEADFEMALE:( Mork and Mindy laugh ) Very fun, Min.
SUPFEMALE:Let's get out before they turn your head into a planter.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, let's go.
OTHERMALE:They wouldn't do that to old Mindy What's my last name again? McDonald.
SUPMALE:E-I-E-I-O ( laughs ) Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Why, she's a little delirious.
OTHERMALE:I just gave her a sedative.
LEADMALE:Her name isn't McDonald, it's McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you look very familiar.
LEADMALE:You assisted me last week in that lip transplant for Mick Jagger, remember that? Well Well, I've re-diagnosed this patient and her brain has cleared up, heh.
LEADMALE:See you later.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:No, Mind.
LEADMALE:Woo! Ahhh.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:That's a great ride.
SUPMALE:Since I usually get sick on ferris wheels.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that's wonderful.
OTHERMALE:There we go.
LEADMALE:Mind, I think I can take you home.
LEADMALE:I'll take those tonsils out there.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:There we go.
OTHERMALE:( both laughing ) Let's go, Mind.
LEADMALE:You dance divinely.
LEADFEMALE:Do you come here often? Well Ow! Woo! Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:What is going on here? I can hear you halfway down the hall.
SUPMALE:Oh, Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Roland, I'm so glad you're here.
SUPFEMALE:That doctor is behaving very strangely.
LEADMALE:Doctor, I think you should put that patient down.
LEADMALE:No, she's mine.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, doctor, please.
SUPMALE:Give Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:McDonald back to us.
OTHERMALE:No, it's not McDonald, it's McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:McDonald.
SUPFEMALE:Over 30 billion sold.
LEADFEMALE:Wanna see my arches? I knew I should have been a plumber.
LEADFEMALE:Look, uh, nurse.
LEADMALE:I, uh think I'm gonna need your assistance here, all right? ( laughs ) Min Mindy, come on, let's go.
LEADMALE:Wait! Hey, no, no, don't, don't.
LEADMALE:Don't you realize you're up six stories? Oh, I love stories.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa! Mindy, Mindy! Get back! Back! I have a thermometer here and you don't know where it's been.
LEADMALE:Mindy.
LEADMALE:I'd like to thank you all for coming and I promise I'll make a darn good Miss America.
LEADFEMALE:Be careful.
OTHERFEMALE:There's a lot of gravity down there.
LEADFEMALE:MAN: Come on, jump.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:You jump.
LEADMALE:Mind We'd better get them before they fall.
SUPMALE:No, stay back.
OTHERFEMALE:Stop! Stay back! Bruce Lee lives.
OTHERMALE:Wahhh! Wahhhh! Wahhhh! Whoa! ( growling ) ( screams ) He bit me! ( grunts ) Oh, there you are.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Burnett.
LEADMALE:Yes, I had a feeling you were on this floor when we found Dr.
LEADMALE:Brody in the closet wearing underwear and striped suspenders.
SUPFEMALE:Do you know this maniac? BURNETT: Now, he's okay.
SUPMALE:His friend Mindy McConnell got mixed up with a patient named Mavis McDonald.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Her name is Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:MINDY: Now for my first dive: A forward half gainer with a full-twist summy.
LEADMALE:Mind! ( Mindy yelps ) I'm so glad you did that.
LEADMALE:You know why? Why? 'Cause I can't swim.
SUPFEMALE:( giggling ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Here, Mindy, have some more ice cream.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, but I think I've had enough.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Keep the You know, if you have any more, we're gonna send you home in a freezer bag.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha! A freezer Freezer Freezer bag.
SUPMALE:You know, Mindy should be sore for only about a day.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be sore for about a week.
SUPMALE:Why are you sore? Well, the nurse bit me back.
SUPFEMALE:You know, this whole rigamarole proves what I always say: You gotta be sick to go in the hospital.
LEADMALE:So simple, yet so meaningless.
SUPMALE:You know, I just can't believe we had all that trouble over a typographical error.
OTHERMALE:Funny, there were no typos on the bill.
OTHERMALE:Oh, well, speaking for my future profession, first I wanna apologize.
LEADMALE:But despite what happened, doctors and nurses really do wanna help.
LEADMALE:I think you've probably gotta help them by keeping your eyes open, asking questions.
LEADMALE:Especially if you fear for your life.
LEADMALE:You know, Mind, I'm glad I saved you from that brain surgery.
SUPMALE:If not, I'd be sitting here now eating ice cream with someone I didn't know and that someone would be you.
LEADMALE:You know, Mork, what would I do without you? Well, probably sitting somewhere in front of a mirror watching yourself drool.
OTHERMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( mystical theme playing ) Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:( Orson coughing ) ORSON: Hello, Mork.
SUPMALE:Oh, Your Corpulence, you sound sick.
SUPFEMALE:Very observant, Mork.
SUPMALE:Why haven't you gone to one of the health clowns? All the ones nearby are broken.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I've been trying to find a doctor, but none of them can afford me.
SUPFEMALE:You won't believe this, sir, but on Earth, people pay doctors.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha! That's crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know.
LEADMALE:Without sick people, doctors would have nothing to do.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know that, Your Lumpyship.
SUPFEMALE:But I've learned on Earth this week that staying healthy's like everything else in life.
LEADFEMALE:It all depends on how much money you have.
OTHERMALE:Were you ill? Oh, no, no, sir.
SUPMALE:Mindy was, but she's all right now.
SUPFEMALE:I had to rescue her from a hospital.
LEADFEMALE:What's a hospital? Well, hospitals are places where Earthlings are interred while they're sick and not released until they give the hospital money.
SUPMALE:It sounds like a jail.
LEADFEMALE:Well, sort of, sir, except the food is worse.
SUPFEMALE:I guess if you get sick on Earth, you're doomed.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, no, sir.
LEADMALE:You see, most doctors and hospitals are quite good.
LEADMALE:But I also realized this week that while it's tough to be sick, it's also tough to be a doctor.
SUPMALE:See, after all, to err is human, but most people won't allow doctors to be human.
SUPMALE:Till next week, sir, nanu.
SUPFEMALE:
