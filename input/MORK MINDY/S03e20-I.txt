LEADMALE:Don't start without me, Mary Lou.
OTHERMALE:Hi, it's time for Shape up with Mary Lou.
LEADMALE:First, some simple warm-ups.
LEADFEMALE:Follow me.
LEADFEMALE:There, there.
SUPMALE:That should build up your bust.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, when I left Ork, I said ''Earth or bust.
LEADMALE:'' Now I've got both, yeah.
OTHERMALE:Now, let's journey to your inner thighs.
LEADMALE:Oh, mondo cellulite.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:y ou beginners can sit this one out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, beginners.
OTHERMALE:Scoff, scoff.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you what you wanna know.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you're home.
SUPMALE:- I have something I wanna ask you.
LEADFEMALE:- Mind, I've something I wanna ask.
SUPFEMALE:- Can you get my legs back together? - What? Oh, okay, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you ever do that again.
OTHERMALE:All right, Mind, shoot.
SUPMALE:Well, I sort of have this problem at work.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Sternhagen, my boss, wants to give me a promotion and a chance to do my own show.
OTHERFEMALE:Mind, oh, you poor pitiful Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, that is a problem.
LEADMALE:How are you ever going to live it down? Mork, that's not the problem part.
SUPFEMALE:See, the rival network came up with this new gossip show and their ratings went sky-high.
LEADMALE:So now Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Sternhagen is hot to do one with me as producer and star.
LEADMALE:- Are we to the problem part yet, Mind? - Yes, Mork.
LEADMALE:See, it is a chance to move up, but on the other hand, I don't know if I can go on TV and gossip about people.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think? In order to give you the advantage of my superior intelligence and computer-like brain, I need one minor piece of information.
LEADFEMALE:What's gossip? I forgot.
LEADMALE:Well, gossip is when people tell personal details about other people's lives.
SUPFEMALE:For instance, if I told you I was having a secret romance with Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley and you told someone else, then that would be gossip.
OTHERFEMALE:You and Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley? Oh, Mind.
LEADMALE:I mean, even in these promiscuous times, I shouldn't care, but I'm always the last to know.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not hypoglycaemic, you don't need a sugar daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, now.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy, all right, I'll leave.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to be excess baggage or a third nostril.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, it's not true.
SUPMALE:That's the point.
LEADMALE:Most gossip isn't true.
SUPMALE:It's like those magazines you see in the supermarket that tell all those intimate details about famous people's lives.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you mean like the ones that have the ridiculous photos that no one would believe.
LEADMALE:Like ones with a picture of Sonny Bono getting a standing ovation.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, also TV has gossip commentators too.
LEADFEMALE:You've seen them.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, that'd be like Dan Rather slinging Roger Mudd.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I think you're starting to get the idea.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, how could I make up stories like that? I mean, I don't even know where I'd get stories like that.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, maybe soaking in a hot bubble bath will make me feel a lot cleaner about the situation.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, say hi to Mr.
LEADMALE:Suds.
SUPMALE:- Okay.
LEADFEMALE:If Mindy can't get those stories and that gossip, I'll get them for her, and the promotion too.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's what I'll do.
LEADMALE:Hello? Information? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, I'd like the truth about M*A*S*H.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, is it true that Corporal Klinger is really Danny Thomas' sister? Excuse me, padre.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Can you tell me about your latest secret romance? Oh, that's all right.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll read about it in True Confessions.
LEADFEMALE:Or maybe Vatican After Dark.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, one more.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hello, there.
LEADMALE:Potato salad.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, Ebony.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:What's my little shutterbug up to now? Looking for gossip.
LEADMALE:Heard the latest? - No.
LEADMALE:- What is it? I was hoping you'd know.
LEADFEMALE:Jeanie, I'm telling you, that guy is a bum.
SUPFEMALE:Nelson, this is your fifth glass of water.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you order something I can charge you for? Remo, do I sense something personal you wanna get off your macho chest? And don't you leave out a titbit.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I'm sorry, but it's Jeanie.
SUPMALE:She's dating another one of those bums, some ambulance-chasing lawyer.
LEADMALE:This guy's got a neck brace as a hood ornament.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:The guy with the license plate that says whiplash.
LEADMALE:That's him.
SUPFEMALE:I'd like to give that lowlife a whiplash.
SUPMALE:Will you stop flashing in my restaurant? Remo, could we sit down and talk about this in the kitchen? - Excuse me, Remo.
LEADMALE:- Hey.
SUPMALE:Boy, hot flashes and dizzy spells.
LEADFEMALE:There's some great scoops here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, a cockroach.
SUPFEMALE:There's plenty of room.
SUPMALE:Don't push.
LEADFEMALE:Garcon, table for 1 2.
SUPFEMALE:The rest of you wait on the burro.
LEADFEMALE:- Exidor.
SUPMALE:- Mork.
OTHERMALE:Is that you? Mork, I've been looking all over for you.
LEADMALE:Have you tried my house? What a novel idea.
SUPFEMALE:Enough of this idle chatter.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I've got great news.
SUPMALE:I've written my life story.
LEADFEMALE:I call it Lauren Bacall: By Myself.
LEADMALE:It worked for her.
LEADMALE:Why tinker with success? It screams bestseller.
LEADMALE:The answer to your question, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Sensationalism.
LEADFEMALE:Why, I've devoted an entire chapter to never dating Shelley Winters.
LEADFEMALE:That sounds hot and heavy.
LEADFEMALE:Can you imagine the movie it'll make? But who could play me? Now, let's see.
SUPFEMALE:Fabian's too old.
LEADMALE:Benji's too short.
LEADMALE:And we can't afford Suzanne Somers.
LEADFEMALE:On to the burro, boys.
LEADMALE:We're off for Tinseltown.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, by the way, did I tell you? The museum wants to do me in wax.
SUPMALE:They say it stops hurting after it cools off.
OTHERMALE:- What am I gonna do? - Honey, listen, I understand.
LEADMALE:It's your decision and it's a doozy, but what's always worked for me through the years is trusting my instincts.
SUPMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:- If he gets mad, he gets mad.
SUPMALE:- He gets mad.
LEADMALE:I mean, so that's life.
SUPFEMALE:That's life.
SUPMALE:Hello, is Mis--? Oh, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Sternhagen.
LEADFEMALE:This is Mindy McConnell.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:Sternhagen, I just can't do that gossip report tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:Why? Well, it's because I feel that No, it's because I really think that I feel that I'm really not feeling very well.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'm not feeling very well.
OTHERMALE:Way to go.
LEADFEMALE:Sort of.
SUPMALE:Hello, Mr.
LEADMALE:Sternhagen.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Mork, Mindy's friend.
OTHERFEMALE:Where is she? Oh, hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Aren't you Mork, Mindy's friend? Yes, and I have all the information here, great photos and some fantastic scoops.
LEADMALE:Aren't you Mork, Mindy's friend? Yes, sir, you're two for two now.
LEADFEMALE:- You seem a bit under the weather.
LEADMALE:- Do you know what? You probably haven't noticed, but I'm a little bit under the weather.
LEADMALE:And do you know why I'm under the weather? Because Mindy McConnell rained-- Mindy McConnell rained on my parade.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, not little Mindy Sunshine.
OTHERMALE:No, little Mindy Monsoon.
LEADMALE:She called me up, and she said she couldn't do the show because she was si Because Because she was sick.
LEADMALE:She don't feel good.
LEADFEMALE:What will this do for her golden career opportunity, though, sir? Oh, well, now, just lookie here.
SUPMALE:This.
SUPMALE:Do you see that fern? - Yes.
LEADFEMALE:- It will be promoted before she will be.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's terrible.
LEADFEMALE:Not as terrible as Dewey Fishbeck's Farm Report.
LEADFEMALE:I have to put that back-- That back on the air and it never got a rating until Dewey tried to milk a bull.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, I've got all the stuff here, and she'll be ready by tomorrow.
SUPMALE:Let me substitute tonight.
SUPFEMALE:You? Fine.
LEADMALE:You have 1 5 seconds.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADMALE:No pressure.
LEADFEMALE:That was a truce.
SUPMALE:And four, three, two, showtime.
SUPMALE:Hello, Hollywood.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, actually, this is Mork, alias Tex Tile, coming to you tonight.
SUPMALE:Well, we've got an earful for you.
SUPFEMALE:First of all, a flash.
LEADMALE:Whoa, watch out.
LEADFEMALE:I have some wonderful things.
LEADFEMALE:Fasten your belts.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know if I can tell.
LEADMALE:Gonna be an earful.
SUPMALE:I can't tell you.
LEADFEMALE:No, well, I can-- No, I can't.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes-- Well, do it.
LEADMALE:Okay, I dragged it out of myself.
LEADMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:What blond bombshell with the initials Glenda Faye Comstock is driving what albino lad to drink? Let's see what we have here? Behold, behold, behold.
LEADMALE:Watch out ''Tacky'' Tom, we're coming at you.
OTHERMALE:Yes, also, what restaurant owner/best friend had to stop him from finishing his fifth? Well, Remo, Remo DaVinci, you get a Mork merit badge, but don't get too attached to that badge, because we might be talking recall.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, watch out here.
SUPFEMALE:Why did you play Raging Remo with your defenceless sister, Jeanie? Let's see how that fits together.
SUPMALE:Watch out there.
OTHERFEMALE:We're not talking too much talky town talk.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what ailing KTNS reporter likes to sing in the shower? Perhaps you should ask her downstairs neighbour why.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, for all these questions, I'm sure you know the answers, Mindy.
SUPMALE:I hope this brought back lots of colours to your cheek.
LEADMALE:We'll be back, Boulder, so keep your stations tuned in and we're gonna dish till dawn.
SUPFEMALE:Terrific, kid.
LEADFEMALE:A star is born.
LEADMALE:Well.
LEADMALE:Congrat-- Congratulations.
SUPFEMALE:I'd have sworn you were Miss Rona if I hadn't seen your hair move.
LEADFEMALE:- All right, where's Mork the Mouse? - Yeah, where is he? - Look, Remo, we're all mad at Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:So let's just calm down, be rational, and find out how high he can bounce.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:- Well - Oh, hold that pose.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, are we all supri--? Wait, is this a surprise party for me just for what I did this evening? - You - Hey! Hey.
LEADMALE:We are all very mad at you.
LEADMALE:Why, because you didn't bring the punch and the cookies? Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:Let's not get physical here.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you guys all should go home and let me handle this.
OTHERFEMALE:That sounds reasonable, Mindy.
SUPMALE:I guess we were taking the law in our own hands.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, it will give me time to find a taxidermist.
LEADFEMALE:Mork will look great above my mantle.
OTHERMALE:I don't know if I can ever call you snugglepuss again.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, wait, wait.
OTHERMALE:Was it something I said? Why do I feel like we're gonna have one of our little talks? Come in, please.
OTHERMALE:Hi, there.
OTHERMALE:Wanna get wet? Look, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley, I can explain this.
LEADMALE:See, Mork was feeling-- Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:I saw Mork's show, and I didn't believe a word of it.
SUPMALE:But I'm happy to report that Boulder does.
SUPFEMALE:The phone hasn't stopped ringing.
LEADMALE:How nice.
LEADMALE:As a famous greeting card writer, I'm used to this kind of sordid innuendo.
OTHERFEMALE:You have no idea how many fans out there are after a piece of the Bick.
LEADMALE:Yes, I think we've heard enough.
SUPFEMALE:Well, kids, I'll be running along now.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm glad you didn't believe that silly story.
SUPMALE:Not a word of it.
OTHERMALE:If you're not busy later on, you know where to find me.
LEADFEMALE:Don't beat me.
OTHERMALE:Don't beat me.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, don't beat me Now do you see what can happen when rumours get started? Well, Mr.
SUPMALE:Bickley was happy, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:He's one out of the whole town.
OTHERFEMALE:That's not a great average, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Do you realize how many reputations you could have ruined tonight? Everyone was happy when I told them juicy pieces of gossip.
SUPFEMALE:I don't even understand why I'm on the endangered Orkan list.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it's not fair, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:It's not fair, not fair.
SUPMALE:Mork, that's because no one likes to hear gossip about themselves.
LEADFEMALE:It's all right when it's about somebody else.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that a little two-sided? Walking the two-sided way of life.
SUPFEMALE:No way, double truths.
LEADFEMALE:Double truths, watch out.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Let me put it to you this way.
LEADFEMALE:How would you like it if I told everyone that you ate eggs? Lying shiksa goddess.
LEADFEMALE:So how does it feel? Well Give me that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I didn't tell any lies, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but you didn't tell the whole truth, either.
SUPFEMALE:And sometimes, half-truths are worse than lies.
SUPFEMALE:How come they do it in the papers and TV and you were about to do it? I didn't say I was gonna do it.
LEADMALE:I didn't say I was gonna do it.
SUPMALE:I just said I got sick.
OTHERMALE:Isn't that a half-truth? The point is, you better do something, or you're gonna lose all your friends.
LEADFEMALE:And I better do something or I'm gonna lose my job.
LEADFEMALE:- What can we do, Mind? - I don't know.
SUPMALE:But we've got a lot of people to apologise to, and we've gotta find a way to do it.
LEADMALE:Well, let's start tonight.
LEADMALE:I'll go get Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Bickley, and I'll meet you in the shower.
LEADFEMALE:Five, four, three, two, we're live.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, I'm Mindy McConnell and the show is Rumour Has lt.
SUPMALE:Today's topic, What Makes a Good Gossip Report? To answer that question, I've invited back yesterday's guest host, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hi, you, Ed.
LEADFEMALE:How about that band, huh? Hey, hey, Doc.
LEADMALE:Hi, Snoozy, Lumpy, Squeezy.
LEADFEMALE:Mork was a little late in getting here.
SUPFEMALE:I was a little late.
SUPFEMALE:How late was I? - So late, the rabbit had been dead-- - Why don't we take a behind-the-scenes look at what goes into making a good gossip report.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thank you, what a wildly spontaneous pre-rehearsed idea.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for setting me up for that one.
LEADMALE:Bless you.
LEADMALE:Yes, to continue, maybe you could tell us, Mork, what ingredients go into a good gossip report? All right.
LEADMALE:First of all, you have to have the right costume.
LEADFEMALE:It's very important to be inconspicuous when you're out searching for information.
LEADMALE:It also takes the right attitude and especially, the right questions.
LEADMALE:For example.
SUPMALE:Hey, are you still beating that dog of yours? What? I don't have a dog.
LEADMALE:Got fed up and ran away.
LEADMALE:Hey, so it's just you and the goat now, huh? What? What goat? Oh, there's more than one? Maybe there's a sheep going, ''Not bad.
LEADMALE:'' As you can see, there's no answering a question like that.
LEADMALE:You got it, dog beater.
LEADMALE:Could we just continue with what we discussed? Like why my stories may appear to be a little dull compared to yours.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, I'll give you a little example right here.
LEADFEMALE:Pick any story and we'll spice it up.
SUPFEMALE:We'll make that sucker sing.
LEADMALE:All right, let's see.
OTHERMALE:I think I have a story right here.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, here's one: ''Last night, young Amy Prescott was rescued from a second-story fire by volunteer fireman Rob Wilson.
LEADFEMALE:She suffered from smoke inhalation and had to be revived by mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
SUPMALE:She is reported in good condition at a County Hospital.
OTHERMALE:'' Boring, Mind.
SUPMALE:Snooze City.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't buy that in a supermarket checkout.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't even buy it for the cat.
LEADFEMALE:What would you do to make that more interesting? Observe, Mindy, watch this place sizzle.
LEADMALE:Young Amy tells all about burning desire of second-story man.
SUPFEMALE:Dateline Sizzle City.
SUPMALE:Watch out.
OTHERMALE:Last night, while Mr.
LEADFEMALE:and Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Boulder were sleeping, Rob Wilson's temperature was rising as he crept into Amy Prescott's room wearing rubber boots and a helmet.
SUPFEMALE:Watch out.
SUPMALE:And all young Amy remembers is his hot sweaty face looming over her as he pressed his parched lips to hers.
SUPMALE:Then he roared off in the night in his long red vehicle, leaving young Amy to wonder where, who, why.
SUPMALE:You know, I think I'm beginning to understand.
SUPFEMALE:And you know what? I don't think I could do that kind of reporting.
OTHERMALE:Even if it means my job.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mind, there's a price we all have to pay and I have had to pay a certain price too.
OTHERFEMALE:I wanna ask you all, what's missing from this picture? That's right.
LEADMALE:All my friends.
SUPFEMALE:I just want to say to all of them, I'm sorry for what I said yesterday because it wasn't true, and I And you're the best friends I have in the world, and I really miss you.
LEADFEMALE:Nelson, Remo, Jeanie and Glenda.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take a picture next time and don't be mad.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the choice is yours, people of Boulder.
LEADMALE:Is this gossip the kind of reporting you wanna see, or would you rather hear the truth? We'll be back after this commercial.
LEADFEMALE:Good stand, Mindy.
OTHERMALE:But I opt for the smut.
SUPMALE:The phones are lighting up, Miss McConnell.
SUPMALE:It's your friends.
LEADMALE:They like your show, and they forgive Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hurray and huzzah.
LEADFEMALE:Too bad you're not working for them.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm sorry, Mr.
LEADMALE:Sternhagen, but I just can't do that kind of gossip reporting.
SUPMALE:Then you leave me with no choice.
SUPMALE:- Oh, I'll take it, Mr.
LEADMALE:Sternhagen.
SUPMALE:- Mork.
LEADMALE:I mean, I've got one more story, some real dirt, some terra firma here.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, sir, but do you know who this is? - Where did you get that? - Let's say I have my sources.
LEADMALE:The story goes like this: What's this Boulder TV exec doing with this bombshell who's not his wife? - Then the story gets hot and intense.
SUPFEMALE:- That's my daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, why tell people that and ruin a perfectly good story? Yes, I see.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Mindy, you're right about this show.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I like about you.
LEADFEMALE:You've got principles.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you take the night off and I'll carry on from here? Thank you, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Sternhagen.
OTHERFEMALE:Back on.
OTHERMALE:Good evening.
LEADFEMALE:And welcome to the Farm Report.
LEADMALE:- Pork bellies are low - Where did you get that picture? I thought you'd learned.
SUPFEMALE:None of your business.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you're right.
OTHERFEMALE:But you know, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Sternhagen's daughter is really beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but I don't think she gets along with her mother well.
OTHERFEMALE:Why would you say that? When Mrs.
LEADMALE:Sternhagen came into the restaurant, her daughter ducked under the table and crawled out the back door.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, oh, Chubby Cheeker.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, why are we whispering? Sir, don't tell a soul.
LEADMALE:I've got a story that's gonna make your toes tingle.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that right, Beebs? What are you talking about, Mork? Well, sir, we're talking about gossip.
SUPMALE:You know, your rumours, your innuendo, your hearsay.
SUPFEMALE:This week, I learned how popular it is with Earthlings unless it's about them.
OTHERMALE:People like to hear things that aren't true? Oh, yes, Your Skinnyness.
LEADMALE:l get your point.
LEADMALE:But you see, sir, sometimes these stories can get out of hand.
LEADMALE:Earthlings are given a special privilege called freedom of speech.
OTHERMALE:But it isn't really free if it costs someone his reputation.
LEADFEMALE:Are you saying this freedom must be exercised with caution? Oh, yes, sir.
LEADMALE:It comes with a responsibility of knowing what not to say and when not to say it.
LEADMALE:lnteresting.
OTHERMALE:And yet you say gossip is popular on Earth.
LEADMALE:Yes, I'm afraid people will always have an appetite for juicy titbits, even though most of it is hard to swallow.
SUPMALE:Until next week, sir, bon appetit.
LEADMALE:
