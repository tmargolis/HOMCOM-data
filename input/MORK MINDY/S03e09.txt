LEADFEMALE:These boys have been at sea for a  long time.
OTHERMALE:We're finally  looking for the great white in dangerous waters.
LEADFEMALE:They say this is the  black h ole, the deep trench.
SUPFEMALE:We don't know why we are here, but they pay us, we go anyway.
LEADMALE:It is a very dangerous search so I send F alco down, my assistant.

LEADMALE:- Oh, really? - Do you wanna know why? Is David Brenner not hosting The Tonight Show? Even better, buddy.
LEADFEMALE:We are t alking about protection.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I know about protection.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, Mr.
LEADMALE:Mork, you can have a choice here.
OTHERFEMALE:You can either  learn to dance or talk  slowly.
LEADMALE:You can get 1 00 do-- I said, $1 00 a day, and all you gotta do is get seriou sly injured.
LEADMALE:Why, do you re alise that one out of four peo ple get hospit alised every year? Oh, what is this? - Some kind of setup for a sick joke? - No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Friend, it's perfec tly true.
LEADMALE:Why, seven peo ple have gotten sick just as I've been t alking to you.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we sho uld be t alking in sign  language.
LEADMALE:- And that's not all.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, sir.
SUPMALE:Why, there are over 4 million automob ile accidents every year.
LEADMALE:Not to mention fires and earthquakes.
LEADMALE:- And twisters.
LEADMALE:- Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:A big  old twister of '4 7 screwed my granny right into the ground.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:Mondo Irwin Allen.
LEADMALE:But, son, you will be protected with our coverage for just a few mea sly pennies a day.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, who cares? Where do I sign? - Where do I sign? - Right here.

OTHERMALE:Honest Ernest Travers, Pikes Peak C alamity and Auto.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice to meet you.
SUPFEMALE:Do you wanna sign here? Mork, you never sign anything before you read it.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mind, I might go belly up between the O and the R.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
OTHERMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, I really don't think you can afford insurance.
LEADMALE:Sure I can.
SUPFEMALE:It only costs a few mea sly pennies.
SUPFEMALE:The ones with President Mea sly on them.
SUPMALE:How many mea sly pennies? Now, madam, you cannot put a price tag on coverage  like this.
OTHERMALE:How much? Oh, about 300 a month, but he's protected from any disaster.
SUPMALE:Do you  please wanna sign this thing,  please? Gotta have this in case mea tloaf falls on me.
LEADFEMALE:I don't wanna end up as a Hamburger H elper.

LEADFEMALE:He doesn't have any money.
SUPMALE:Thank you very much and goodbye.
LEADMALE:You can't just  leave after scaring the bejeebies out of me.
LEADMALE:- Bye-bye.
OTHERFEMALE:- Bye-bye, bye.
LEADMALE:Mindy, he said bye.
OTHERFEMALE:Mind, I don't think-- White man come, take Bic.
LEADMALE:Mind, I needed that protection.
SUPFEMALE:Why wo uldn't you  let me get it? Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:On Earth, some s alesmen aren't  always ethic al.
LEADMALE:Besides, it sounds  like he was using scare tactics to talk you into something you don't need.
LEADFEMALE:It worked.
SUPFEMALE:There might be something awful  lurking outside the door.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, there's nothing lurking outside the door that wasn't there  last night.
LEADFEMALE:You're not sure? Behind you.
LEADFEMALE:- You didn't fall for it, eh? - No.
LEADFEMALE:Come on,  let's make the chec klist for the trip.
OTHERMALE:You're gonna  love Yellowstone this time of year.
LEADFEMALE:- It's so pretty.
SUPFEMALE:- Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Especially this time This time of year is winter, isn't it, Mind? Don't peo ple freeze their klarns off in winter? We're gonna be staying in a nice, warm  lodge.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's better, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Nice, warm-- Well, co uldn't that  lodge get re al warm if it burned down, Mind? It's not gonna burn down.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah? What happens if some big Boy Scout rubs two rooms together? Mork, we've been  planning this trip for weeks now.
LEADMALE:You don't wanna disappoint N elson and  Glenda, do you? - Maybe.
SUPFEMALE:- That s alesman made you paranoid.
SUPFEMALE:Why do you say that, Mind? If you think about it  logically, what could possibly happen to you? - Come on, really.
LEADMALE:- Yeah, you're right.
OTHERMALE:Be  logical, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:You know how kind of cute and cuddly I am? What if one of those big griz zly bears decides to take a Morky doll to bed? I mean, they  sleep all winter.
SUPFEMALE:What happens if it comes spring? I don't wanna wake up as Smokey's fiance.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bic kley, where's Mork? I got your  lunch.
LEADMALE:Well, he's calling the weather service in Yokohama.
SUPMALE:He wanted to see if a tid al wave was headed for Boulder.
LEADMALE:A tid al wave in Bo ulder.
LEADMALE:Wow, that's great.
SUPMALE:Listen, what is Mork so anxious about, anyway? Modern  living.
OTHERMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, are you all right? I mean, compared to your norm al level of strangeness.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Today is but a foetus.
SUPMALE:- I  almost met Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Reaper.
LEADFEMALE:It was grim.
SUPFEMALE:- What happened? Well, I was out there making a phone call, and a  block away, a van swerved and hit a wall.
LEADFEMALE:- What does that have to do with you? - A month ago, I was at the same spot.
LEADFEMALE:And if it wasn't for December, I'd be decomposing right now, just like Mozart.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:- You understand, don't you? - Oh, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, it's everywhere.
SUPMALE:I'm okay.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I feel safe here.
LEADMALE:I do, I really do.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know why.
LEADMALE:It's getting so we're not safe anywhere.
LEADMALE:Look how we're polluting the air.
SUPMALE:A guy I know last year shot a duck and it took it three days to hit the ground.
LEADMALE:That poor dog  slipped a disc waiting for that sucker to fall.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I better stop breathing.
LEADMALE:- You might as well stop eating too.
OTHERMALE:- Why, what's wrong with the food? Well, there's  always some he alth faddist  claiming food has stuff in it that's dangerous.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERMALE:No wonder they say a prayer before every me al.
SUPFEMALE:Why, even this  plate co uld be coated with toxic, lead-based paint.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody, hit the deck! This  plate's about to go off! Watch out! Hey, that  plate cost me 5 pesos.
LEADMALE:Of course we're civ ilised men.
LEADMALE:Besides, there's no  place to hide.
LEADFEMALE:The wo rld, as we know it, is coming to an end.
LEADFEMALE:And me without a chick.
LEADFEMALE:- Exidor.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork.
OTHERMALE:Is that you? One moment.
SUPMALE:Boys, wh ile we chat, go loot the bathroom.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you say the wo rld was coming to an end? No, I said that.
SUPMALE:Proof: I was just struck by this meteor from the M elmac g alaxy.
SUPFEMALE:Do you b elieve this guy? Well, I've seen cham eleons with a better grasp on reality.
LEADFEMALE:Those cynics will be foss ils in two hours.
SUPMALE:The wo rld will be over at 4:00.
LEADFEMALE:Three o' clock, Centr al Time.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I'm gonna miss you, you big loon.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, you're my dearest Let's do something that will make this moment last an eternity.
LEADFEMALE:Well, forget eternity.
LEADMALE:What about the next ten seconds? Well, we co uld say: I've got everything we need right here.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, don't you think you're a little over-prepared for a trip to Yellowstone? What trip? I'm staying here.
LEADFEMALE:You're staying here? Well, then, what's that stuff for? I'm prepared for every c alamity imagina ble.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this, I have a snakebite kit.
LEADMALE:I have shark repellent.
OTHERFEMALE:- Foghorn, a mosquito net.
SUPMALE:- Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Highway  flares.
LEADMALE:Don't stop me now, Mind, I'm on a roll.
LEADMALE:We've got a pe nlight in case we fall into a  black h ole.
OTHERFEMALE:Watch out.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:H elp me now, h elp me now.
LEADFEMALE:And some Handi-Wipes in case we get attacked by a  flock of fried chicken.
LEADMALE:There's no chance we're gonna fall into a  black h ole and o nly a 50-50 chance we'll be attacked by fried chicken.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, I prepared for the reg ular c alamities too, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Your famine, your pest ilence, your fire.
LEADMALE:You forgot the ever-pop ular  flood.
LEADFEMALE:You thought you had me there, Princess Hokum? No way.
LEADFEMALE:I'm prepared for that too, Mind.
LEADMALE:Watch this.
LEADMALE:Yes, sir.
SUPFEMALE:lt's Morko's Noah's ark.
LEADFEMALE:I have anim als outside, two by two.
LEADMALE:They are coming to audition, bringing 5-by-4s.
LEADMALE:Hello, my name is Ca rl, I'm a squirr el.
LEADFEMALE:This is my wife, L ola.
OTHERMALE:See, I'm gonna ignore all this.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go to the store and buy some hiking boots.
LEADMALE:And you are coming with me on that trip.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Well, you've ove rlooked one vit al statistic.
LEADMALE:The statistics say that more accidents occur in the home than any place  else.
OTHERFEMALE:So think how much safer you'll be with me in Yellowstone.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not safe out there.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not safe in here.
SUPMALE:I'm not safe anywhere.
OTHERMALE:I want my test tube.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, I got the hiking boots.
SUPMALE:What are the lights out for? I co uldn't reach the switch, Mind.
LEADMALE:What do you mean, you co uldn't reach the switch? What in the world is that? It's a surviv al condo, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I've finally found a  place where I'm safe.
SUPMALE:I'm never coming out.
LEADMALE:This is ridic ulous.
LEADMALE:No, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a hermetically-se aled, germ-free, antiseptic life-support unit.
SUPMALE:It's kind of like a womb with a view.
LEADFEMALE:How do you like it, Mind? I got the  plans from Better Homes and Shelters.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't it wonderf ul? Mindy, you can go on with your life as usu al.
LEADFEMALE:Just don't peek in here when I'm in my undies.
LEADMALE:Mork, where wo uld you ever get a crazy idea like this? It's not crazy.
OTHERFEMALE:We used this on Ork during the famous swine- flu epidemic.
LEADFEMALE:It kept pigs from bouncing on us.
LEADMALE:Now you know why their noses are so  flat.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you can't stay in here forever.
SUPMALE:Oh, por que, Mind, por que? Listen, this is wonderf ul in here.
LEADFEMALE:At last, I've finally found a  place where I'm safe.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing can harm me, gives me 24-hour protection, doesn't even stain my clothes.
SUPFEMALE:- You'll just withdraw from the world? - You've got it.
LEADMALE:You're gonna hide in your shell, trem bling with fear at anything that co uld possi bly hurt you? All right, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you where you can get one of your own.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you're gonna have to come out sooner or later.
LEADFEMALE:No, I don't.
LEADFEMALE:I've got enough provisions in here for nine or ten bleams.
SUPMALE:Look at this here.
OTHERMALE:I've got canned water.
SUPMALE:Isn't that incredi ble, canned water? Open it up, there's water inside.
LEADFEMALE:Watch out, Mind.
LEADMALE:Hey, tell you what.
OTHERFEMALE:There's room in here for two.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, you'll be finally safe.
OTHERFEMALE:But I'm out here and I'm all right.
OTHERMALE:Anyway, everybody's exposed to those things you're so afraid of.
SUPFEMALE:We'll see who's laughing a hundred years from now.
LEADFEMALE:When everybody  else is going, ''H elp me.
LEADMALE:'' I'll be going, ''I'm young.
LEADFEMALE:'' Don't you see what is happening to you? Yes, I'm protected.
SUPFEMALE:- You're paranoid.
LEADFEMALE:- I'm inv ulnera ble.
LEADMALE:- You're untoucha ble.
SUPFEMALE:- I'm safe.
LEADFEMALE:- You're  alone.
LEADFEMALE:- I'm afraid.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid too, Mork.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid for you.
SUPMALE:Well, we've still got each other, huh? I guess something has finally come between us, huh? Big kiss.
LEADFEMALE:You guys still  planning on going to Yellowstone tomorrow? Yeah, tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I bought this jacket.
LEADMALE:With my com plexion, I don't want anybody to confuse me with a snowman.
SUPMALE:It's gotta hurt when they jam that carrot in your face.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy, I really wish I was going with you guys.
LEADMALE:I can't get off work and I gotta study for my anatomy  class.
LEADMALE:Oh, speaking of anatomy, Mindy says I sho uldn't bring my bikini.
SUPFEMALE:Now, what do you think? Wear it,  Glenda,  please.
LEADFEMALE:Bikinis are very big this time of year in Yellowstone.
LEADMALE:N elson  Flavor, you're a sexist.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Are you really gonna go to Yellowstone with this guy? Wait a minute, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Are you two guys becoming an item here or what, huh? - Yes.
LEADMALE:- No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Jeanie, the freezer motor is busted again.
LEADFEMALE:Co uld you  please fix it? And hurry, the  clams are starting to open.
LEADMALE:A woman's work is never done.
LEADMALE:I was just kidding about the bikini.
LEADMALE:I wo uldn't want you to catch a c old.
SUPMALE:A one-piece wo uld be fine.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, guys.
OTHERMALE:- Hi, Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:- Hi, Mindy.
SUPMALE:Did Mork change his mind about the trip or is he still in his humidor? Yes.
LEADMALE:The last part.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think he's ever coming out.
LEADMALE:He just sits in there sipping his Tang.
SUPMALE:Well, it is a lit tle strange.
LEADMALE:If I were you, I wo uld look upon him as a big guppy and just be gratef ul you don't have to  clean that tank.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you guys, I fe el like we're  already spo iling the trip.
SUPMALE:You  already have.
LEADMALE:- N elson.
LEADFEMALE:- It's wrecked.
SUPFEMALE:No, really, maybe you sho uld make  plans without us.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, we haven't given up yet.
LEADMALE:I mean, we're bound to think of something.
SUPFEMALE:I'm telling you, I've tried everything.
LEADFEMALE:I've begged, I've  pleaded.
OTHERFEMALE:I've even tried using logic.
LEADFEMALE:Now, logic, that will never work.
LEADMALE:Mindy, you know, maybe you're paying too much attention to him.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah, if he wants is olation, I'll give him is olation.
SUPFEMALE:We'll all give him is olation.
LEADFEMALE:I've got a great idea.
SUPFEMALE:Do you guys think you can come over to my house around 8:00 tonight? We might be a ble to find a way to get Mork out of that  glass box.
SUPMALE:We'll just fight bizarre with bizarre.
LEADMALE:And if that doesn't work, we'll get Ella Fitzger ald to come over and hit a high note.
OTHERFEMALE:Expecting company, Mind? I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Oh, so  clean, I didn't even know it was there.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi, come on in.
SUPMALE:- Here we go.
LEADMALE: Glenda, N elson.
SUPMALE:If I knew you were coming, I wo uld have squeegeed my face.
OTHERMALE:Oh, what a great idea, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:A going-away party for Mork.
LEADMALE:A party for me? I hope there's a pony ride.
LEADFEMALE:Well, actually, N elson, it's a gone-away party.
LEADMALE:Gone, yes, but not forgotten.
SUPFEMALE:Too bad Mork had to go.
LEADMALE:He was so much fun at parties.
LEADMALE:Wait.
SUPMALE:I'm still here and I'm still fun at parties.
LEADMALE:Watch.
LEADFEMALE:Watch this, hey, watch this.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let's get this party started.
LEADMALE:Party down.
LEADFEMALE:I'll mix us up a lit tle punch.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get it.
SUPMALE:Shazbot, I did it again.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, Mindy, I'm sorry I'm late.
LEADFEMALE:I was gonna bring some forget-me-nots, but I got a break on this.
LEADFEMALE:The fellow it was for pulled through.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:I'm sure Mork wo uld have appreciated it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, but I'm still here.
OTHERMALE:I really am.
LEADMALE:I'm here.
LEADMALE:Yo.
LEADMALE:You know, it's so quiet here without him.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, it took some getting used to, but life does go on.
SUPFEMALE:- Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:- Mind.
LEADMALE:Punch, anybody? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bic kley? Nice idea.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Good  old Mork.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure gonna miss that little tyke.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure, he was strange, but that was his charm.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna miss his laugh.
LEADMALE:That certain: I'm gonna miss the way he wore his suspenders.
LEADFEMALE:- The way he wore his hat.
SUPMALE:- What hat? The way he sang off-key.
LEADMALE:That's it, that's it.
SUPMALE:The memory of all that, no, no, they can't take that away from me.
SUPMALE:Cheers.
SUPMALE:Wait.
OTHERMALE:If Rod Serling w alks in this door, I'm gonna hatch a brick, I know I am.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I didn't know him as long as the rest of you did, but I have one re al regret.
OTHERMALE:I just wish he wo uldn't have gone away before I found out what shazbot meant.
SUPFEMALE:If you talk to me, I'll tell you what shazbot means.
LEADMALE:I'll even tell you what klarns are.
SUPMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:Bic kley, didn't you have something you wanted to say? Funny you sho uld mention it.
LEADFEMALE:I just happen to have a lit tle gem here from Mork's favourite greeting-card writer.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Bick.
LEADFEMALE:- Me.
LEADFEMALE:An Ode to Mork.
LEADFEMALE:To my friend, l say, bon voyage l can offer but this verbal corsage l loved his eyes, l loved his nose but now l hope l get his clothes Oh, that was so wonderf ul.
SUPFEMALE:I'm beginning to miss mys elf.
LEADFEMALE:You know-- Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:I'm still here.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mind, joke's over.
OTHERMALE:- Come on.
LEADFEMALE:- There's something I'd like to say.
LEADFEMALE:The Mork we all knew and loved is no longer with us.
LEADMALE:He was so full of life.
LEADFEMALE:I remember one time when I asked him to change a hundred-watt b ulb.
LEADMALE:He ran to the corner and brought back two 25s and a 50.
SUPFEMALE:He used to spend hours trying to teach a tub of margarine how to say ''butter.
SUPFEMALE:'' He was the o nly guy I knew who wo uld really give you a penny for your thoughts.
OTHERMALE:Oh, he was so speci al.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Mind, I'm still  alive.
OTHERMALE:I'm  alive, I'm right here.
LEADMALE:Are you, Mork? Peo ple who are  alive don't shut thems elves off from the wo rld.
LEADFEMALE:You're not protecting yours elf from harm, you're  closing yours elf off from everything that makes life worth living.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna miss you, Mork.
LEADMALE:Goodbye.
LEADMALE:Mind? Oh, I  already miss you.
LEADMALE:I don't wanna give up on life.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I wanna live again.
LEADFEMALE:What are we waiting for? I wanna go on that trip to Yellowstone.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, yes.
SUPMALE:Don't forget to bring your racket.
LEADFEMALE:We'll have something to do.
SUPFEMALE:Now, that's the Mork I know and vagu ely understand.
SUPFEMALE:My boy.
SUPMALE:Oh, Bick, I'm sorry about the  clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's okay.
LEADFEMALE:They weren't for me.
LEADFEMALE:I was gonna cut them down for my dog.
SUPMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPFEMALE:Goodbye, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Good to have you back.
LEADFEMALE:You two keep it quiet up here.
OTHERFEMALE:See? Oh, nice.
SUPMALE:That fe els better than any security in the wh ole wo rld.
OTHERMALE:I just want you to remember one thing, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:No matter how weird life gets, you just gotta keep on living.
LEADFEMALE:- I mean, look at your  alternative.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:This  place is a nice  place to visit, but I wouldn't wanna live here without you.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mind, no kissing.
SUPFEMALE:Say no-no to Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Mono.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you're right, Mind, what the heck? Come on, now.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Five, six, seven, eight.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in, oh, Butterball in the Sky.
LEADMALE:Mork, what are you two doing? Oh, we're c elebrating life, sir.
LEADFEMALE:You might say we're tripping the life fantastic.
LEADFEMALE:l didn't think life on Earth was all that pleasant, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Well, sir, it's got its share of dangers, but many of them are  blown out of proportion, not u nlike you.
LEADMALE:- Just get to the point.
LEADMALE:- Yes, sir.
LEADMALE:The point is that Eart hlings can prove any point they want using statistics.
SUPFEMALE:You see, many newspapers t alk about how many peo ple have died, but they never say how many peo ple have lived.
LEADFEMALE:I can even prove that you are not fat using the right statistics.
LEADFEMALE:l am not fat.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, sir.
SUPFEMALE:You're so large you have your own  climate.
LEADFEMALE:- l'll ignore that, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Yes, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Now, are you telling me that people should be totally oblivious to the dangers surrounding them? No, but if that's all they're looking for, that's all they're gonna see.
OTHERFEMALE:Unfortunat ely, most Eart hlings spend their whole life, well, worrying about, well, their whole life.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never forget the lesson I learned this week from my Eart hling friends.
LEADMALE:They taught me that the greatest gift is the gift of life and the greatest sin is to return it unopened.
LEADMALE:Unt il next week, sir.
SUPFEMALE:I've got a lot of unwrapping to do.
