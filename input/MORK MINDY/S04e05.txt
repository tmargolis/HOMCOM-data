SUPMALE:I don't believe it.
OTHERFEMALE:Our baby is a full-grown man.
SUPFEMALE:Things like this just don't happen in the Midwest.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call Dad.
LEADFEMALE:He'll know what to do.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, he won't.
LEADFEMALE:That child is astounding.
LEADMALE:Absolutely phenomenal.
LEADFEMALE:This is the first time a baby has ever given me a perfect footprint for the birth certificate.
LEADMALE:Look at that beauty.
LEADFEMALE:Not a smudge on it.
OTHERFEMALE:Great, Exidor.
SUPMALE:That's Dr.
LEADMALE:Exidor.
SUPMALE:Now, I know you have a lot of questions for your pediatrician.
SUPFEMALE:This has got to be the most bizarre thing that's ever happened in my entire life.
OTHERMALE:Don't you think that baby is unusually large? Baby? What baby? Why wasn't I consulted? I'm talking about our baby.
LEADFEMALE:The distinguished-looking gentleman in the diaper.
OTHERMALE:Oh, him.
LEADFEMALE:Rather unique.
LEADFEMALE:He seems so alien.
SUPMALE:I wonder if there's anything Earthling about him.
SUPFEMALE:Why do new parents always ask that question? Your baby is half-Orkan.
LEADFEMALE:That means he's aging backwards, and he has three hearts.
LEADFEMALE:But he does have some human characteristics.
SUPMALE:For instance, he seems to enjoy a good story.
LEADFEMALE:What? Oh, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, I'm a mother.
LEADMALE:Huzzah, huzzah! Here, have one.
LEADMALE:They're Tiparillo lights.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I couldn't have done it without you.
LEADMALE:I couldn't have even lifted him without you.
SUPMALE:This has just all happened so fast.
LEADMALE:I really think we need to talk about this.
LEADMALE:Alone.
OTHERMALE:I suppose I'm not invited to dinner either.
LEADMALE:Well, I've got to finish my paper for the medical journal.
OTHERMALE:Anyway, I'm going to be the best dance critic they ever had.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, I have to admit, he's the most beautiful child you've ever seen.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, wait till you see the little overalls I got him.
OTHERMALE:He looks just like Lester Maddox on steroids.
LEADMALE:Yeah, he's cute, Mork, in a mature sort of way, but our baby isn't exactly what I was expecting.
SUPMALE:Oh, we'll have a girl next time, Mind.
LEADMALE:No, that's not what I meant.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, he's different.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, he has the body of a 50-year-old and the mind of an infant.
SUPMALE:Well, you said you always liked Jerry Lewis.
OTHERMALE:Mork, having a child is difficult under normal circumstances, but, Mork, rhinos have smaller babies.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, do I sense a little note of trepidation there? Now, come on, now, he's a little helpless innocent child.
LEADFEMALE:- Well - Come, there's nothing to be afraid of.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:No, he's just a little nooter.
SUPFEMALE:Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, he can walk.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, he can destroy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, isn't it amazing? Isn't he magnificent? I mean, who ever stood after being only an hour old? Black Beauty.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
OTHERFEMALE:Come to Mama.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, there we go.
LEADMALE:Another one for Baby News.
SUPFEMALE:One more, there we go.
SUPFEMALE:There's one.
OTHERMALE:There One for Parents' World.
SUPMALE:There's another.
LEADMALE:There.
LEADMALE:Now, a little nother one.
LEADMALE:There we go.
LEADMALE:Oh, good, good.
SUPMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:There.
SUPFEMALE:Playboy.
LEADFEMALE:One for Playboy.
LEADFEMALE:There we go.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's okay.
LEADMALE:After Dark.
SUPFEMALE:One for After Dark.
OTHERMALE:Oh, little pooter, little pooter.
OTHERFEMALE:Neener-neener-neener.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind.
LEADMALE:Oh, isn't he the most beautiful? Oh, little pooter, come on, now, pucker up.
LEADMALE:Come over here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, there we go.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa! Oh, Mind, isn't he beautiful? I mean, he's got your eyes and Charles Bronson's beard.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Now, make nice, make nice.
LEADMALE:There.
LEADMALE:Hi there.
SUPFEMALE:I'm your, uh, father.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's nice.
SUPMALE:I think I've thought of a name for him, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh Ow! - No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Here's the name.
LEADFEMALE:Here's the name.
LEADFEMALE:You combine Mork, Mindy and Earth equals Mearth.
OTHERFEMALE:Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth McConnell.
LEADMALE:- Well, it is unusual.
LEADFEMALE:- Right.
SUPFEMALE:But then, so is he.
LEADMALE:Heh, heh.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
SUPFEMALE:No, you have to bite off the tip first.
LEADMALE:No! No, he'll choke on that.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mearth.
SUPFEMALE:Mearth, Mearth, Mearth, look over there.
LEADMALE:Mearth, look.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:He hasn't eaten since he arrived.
OTHERMALE:What do you think he eats? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:He's got all of his teeth.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe a little beef jerky.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, I think he'd rather eat my comforter.
LEADMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:No, Mind, Mind, Mind.
OTHERMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:No, Mind, I think he wants the flowers in the comforter, not the comforter.
LEADFEMALE:- Are you sure? - I know my own son, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Here we go.
OTHERFEMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:Hare Krishna, Hare Lama Hare Krishna Hey there No.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Let's hope there are no bees on there.
OTHERFEMALE:- Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:- Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Bathe the baby, bathe the baby.
LEADFEMALE:I told Mork he wouldn't fit in the sink.
LEADMALE:- Who is it? - It's me, honey.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:Look at you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm just on my way to play a little Dixieland.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, yeah? - So how's the new bride doing? Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:Heh, heh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's an interesting piece of sculpture.
LEADFEMALE:Is it a wedding gift? Oh, no, it's not a present.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, it's a piece of a great big eggshell.
LEADMALE:What was in it, a Buick? Close.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess there's no putting this off any longer.
SUPFEMALE:I've got something to tell you.
OTHERMALE:And I think you better take this sitting down.
SUPFEMALE:Well, okay, honey, fire away.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see, how should I put this? Remember when I was 11 and you told me where babies came from? Yes.
LEADMALE:You lied.
SUPMALE:Well, now, Mindy, I may have glossed over a few major details, but I never lied.
LEADFEMALE:Right, that's true.
OTHERMALE:We've always been truthful with each other, so I'm just gonna lay this right out.
LEADFEMALE:See, for some strange Orkan reason, Mork got pregnant, laid an egg, and now we're parents.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:Boy, I'm glad that's over with.
LEADMALE:Uh, are you trying to tell me that I'm the grandfather of a chicken? No.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, it's a baby.
LEADFEMALE:It's a 6-foot 225-pound middle-aged baby named Mearth.
SUPFEMALE:Are you serious? Dad, don't fall apart on me.
OTHERMALE:You're the only one I can talk to about this.
SUPFEMALE:- Are you serious? - I know it's a shock.
LEADFEMALE:It was for me too.
LEADMALE:I mean, where am I gonna find size 46 Pampers? Where is he? Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, um, uh Mork took him to the park for lunch.
LEADMALE:They're grazing in a flower bed.
SUPFEMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:- To the park? - No, we're going to the airport.
LEADFEMALE:By tomorrow morning, you can be in Brazil.
LEADMALE:Dad, I'm not gonna run away.
LEADMALE:I mean, he's my son.
LEADMALE:I know it's kind of weird now, but I'm sure in enough time, I'll grow to love every hair on his chest.
LEADMALE:Won't I? Well, honey, if that's what you wanna do.
LEADMALE:Oh, sure, you will, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you never were afraid of new experiences.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you married an alien and you went to another planet, and you were the first girl in Boulder to play Little League baseball.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you're right.
LEADMALE:You have to realize that most squirrels don't normally fly like that.
LEADMALE:My God, it is true.
LEADMALE:Say hi to Grandpops.
LEADFEMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:Say "Hi, Grandpa.
LEADFEMALE:" There you go.
LEADMALE:Neener-ner.
SUPMALE:Quick, Mindy, call Air Brazil.
LEADMALE:Well, there he goes again, every hour, on the hour, just like clockwork.
LEADFEMALE:Yep.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll give him his bottle.
LEADFEMALE:But this time, you burp him.
SUPFEMALE:I think I threw my shoulder out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Look, Mork, he tossed out his bottle again.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's your bottle.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
LEADMALE:Powdered.
LEADFEMALE:Powdered? It's not powder, it's He spoke! Oh, Mind, he's a genius.
SUPFEMALE:Our little baby can talky-awky.
OTHERMALE:Don't patronize me.
LEADMALE:Where would he learn such big words? Well, William F.
SUPMALE:Buckley was hosting The Muppets this evening.
LEADMALE:Let me see the quality, the porcine and porcupine quality, of the tiny bubbles as the hands motivate the motion.
OTHERMALE:Mearth, watch Daddy.
LEADMALE:Mearth, what's Daddy bouncing on? - What is it? - Tush.
LEADMALE:I was shooting for bed, but he's right.
LEADFEMALE:Of course he is, Mind.
LEADMALE:He's half a superior being.
LEADMALE:What? All right.
LEADMALE:And who are you? - Who are you? - Mearth.
OTHERFEMALE:- And who am I? - Mommy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Mind, I feel just like Anne Bancroft in The Miracle Worker.
LEADFEMALE:And now the big question, no pressure, though.
SUPFEMALE:- Who's this? - Mm - Shoe.
SUPMALE:- Shoe? Hey, isn't that wonderful, Mind? His first non sequitur.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork, he called me "Shoe.
LEADFEMALE:" - Funny, you don't look Shoeish.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, now.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, now, my little Mearth, my little whiz kid.
LEADMALE:Say "Daddy.
OTHERFEMALE:" Daddy.
LEADMALE:Tired.
LEADMALE:Mind, he's bilingual.
SUPFEMALE:Great, he's bilingual.
LEADMALE:You're Mommy and I'm Shoe.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:He still loves you.
SUPMALE:Besides, he'll be up again in another hour and we'll try again.
LEADFEMALE:- Good night, hon.
SUPMALE:- Good night.
SUPMALE:Night, Mearth.
LEADMALE:You know, Mork, now that he's talking, we're gonna have to be careful no one finds out he's an A-L-I-E-N.
LEADFEMALE:If anyone should find out that Whoa! Mind, what are you doing on the floor? Looks like I got squeezed out.
SUPFEMALE:- I just wanted to cuddle.
OTHERFEMALE:- Aw.
SUPFEMALE:He's just afraid, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:We saw The Shining today, remember? I don't wanna go now.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that's all right.
SUPFEMALE:There's not room for the three of us.
LEADFEMALE:I'll sleep on the couch.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, no, no, you do the honors.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be more comfortable on the couch.
LEADMALE:- Night, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Night, Mind.
SUPMALE:- Night, Mearth.
SUPMALE:- Night, Shoe.
LEADMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:Mork, what happened? Have you been robbed? No, Mearth and I were just playing Morkie Dearest.
SUPMALE:Three-hundred-dollar dress on a wire hanger? - Let me untie you.
LEADFEMALE:- No, no, no, that's all right.
OTHERFEMALE:It's the only way I can sit through Phil Donahue.
LEADMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Mork, little Mearth I mean, big Mearth kind of took me by surprise, but the bottom line is, I am his grandfather.
LEADFEMALE:He's my grandson, so it's about time I started spoiling him.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, football.
SUPFEMALE:He's gonna love that.
SUPFEMALE:- No, Mork, it's baseball.
LEADFEMALE:I knew that.
LEADMALE:That's what you do before you start selling coffee machines.
LEADFEMALE:Well, okay.
LEADFEMALE:So where's the bride? Oh, Pops, you'll be so proud of her.
OTHERMALE:Perfect American father.
LEADFEMALE:She comes home late, never plays with the kids, and brings in the paycheck.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Mork, I don't think you understand what a good father is.
LEADMALE:You see, good fathers wanna be there as much as they can be.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh.
SUPFEMALE:- It's wonderful to watch your children grow up, and it's It's wrong that she's missing it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:On third thought, Pops, I guess you're right.
LEADMALE:If it wasn't for Mr.
LEADMALE:Sternhagen forcing her nose down to the grindstone, she'd be here right now.
OTHERMALE:- What are you talking about? - He asked her to work the night shift.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, no, he didn't, Mork.
LEADMALE:Didn't Mindy tell you that she volunteered for the night shift? Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:I feel like I've gotta sit down.
LEADMALE:Oh, you are sitting.
LEADFEMALE:Just bend your legs.
SUPMALE:How convenient.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy asked to work the night shift? - Do you know what that means? - I'm afraid I do.
LEADMALE:Will you tell me? All right, Mork, I'll try.
SUPFEMALE:Uh I think Mindy is confused and apprehensive about being a parent to Mearth.
SUPFEMALE:What she needs is time to be close to the child, and then love will take care of the rest.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:You're right, Pops.
LEADMALE:No house of mine's gonna become a broken home.
OTHERFEMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, Houdini, watch out.
LEADMALE:Mearth, come on, now.
SUPMALE:We're gonna go find Mindy.
LEADMALE:Well, give me a head start.
SUPMALE:It's gonna take me a while.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Mork, you're not gonna let him go out like that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth, go put on your jacket.
SUPFEMALE:Well, isn't this an exciting feature? We'll be back after this commercial to the KTNS Science Fiction Festival and the dramatic conclusion of It Came From Diablo Canyon.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go, come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, I got here as fast as I could.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, what are you doing here? And why is Mearth up so late? I have to make a report to O-R-S-O-N.
OTHERFEMALE:- About what? - Sagittarian women.
LEADMALE:What? Wait.
OTHERFEMALE:- Mind, I can't talk.
LEADFEMALE:- You can't leave him here like this.
LEADMALE:Take care of him.
LEADFEMALE:Take care of him.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mearth.
LEADMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:So, Mearth, where did Mommy take you for lunch today? To a Japanese restaurant, and I had tempura and sashimi and bonsai tree.
LEADFEMALE:Bonsai tree? Oh, yeah, that sounds nutritious.
OTHERFEMALE:So, what do you think of where Daddy works? Pathetic.
LEADFEMALE:I have better stuff than this in my room.
LEADFEMALE:Fake.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, don't touch that.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy didn't mean to scare you.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that Daddy's rocket ship is not a toy.
OTHERMALE:When's Mommy coming back? Well, soon, I hope.
LEADMALE:Mearth, you have on your pitcher's mitt upside down.
LEADFEMALE:Here, let me help you.
LEADFEMALE:Did Mommy teach you how to play baseball? No? You put it on right Give me your Here, give me your hand.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Mearth, look over there.
LEADFEMALE:Now, give me your hand.
LEADFEMALE:Help me.
LEADFEMALE:Want me to teach you how to play catch? Yeah? Okay.
SUPMALE:Come over here and Daddy will teach you how to play catch.
OTHERFEMALE:Whew.
LEADMALE:Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth, we're gonna I'm gonna throw the ball, and you catch it, okay? Okay? Now, you keep your eye on the ball.
LEADMALE:Mearth, watch the ball and catch the ball.
LEADMALE:Here you go.
LEADFEMALE:One, two, three.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh! Mearth, look over there.
LEADFEMALE:What's that? What's that over there? Yeah.
LEADMALE:We're gonna try this again.
LEADMALE:Whew.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's all right.
LEADFEMALE:Tickle, tickle, tickle.
SUPMALE:This time I'm gonna throw it, and you catch it in the mitt, okay? You catch it in the mitt.
LEADMALE:Okay? Here we go.
SUPMALE:Watch the ball.
LEADMALE:One, two, three.
OTHERMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:And they call this the national pastime? Mearth.
SUPMALE:This time, Daddy knows you're gonna catch the ball.
LEADFEMALE:Put the mitt like this, okay? Here we go.
LEADMALE:One, two, three.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, he caught the ball! - Oh! Ah! Daddy.
LEADMALE:Daddy, Daddy, Daddy - What'd you say? - Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:That's great, son.
LEADFEMALE:- You did real good.
LEADFEMALE:Wanna try again? - No.
LEADFEMALE:Room for one more? Mork, I'll bet there wasn't an emergency at all, was there? Yes, there was, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't feel part of the family.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I have been running away.
OTHERFEMALE:But you know what? I'm gonna quit this night job so I can spend all my time with you two.
LEADMALE:Oh, this is a wonderful moment.
SUPMALE:We're so much happier than the Jeffersons.
SUPFEMALE:You know what would make me really happy? If Mearth would call me Mommy.
SUPMALE:Mearth? Mearth.
OTHERFEMALE:Mommy, Mearth.
SUPFEMALE:- Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:- Mommy.
SUPMALE:- Mommy.
OTHERFEMALE:- Mm-hm.
LEADMALE:Daddy.
LEADMALE:Shoe.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Your Grandioseness.
SUPMALE:Hello, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You seem to be in an unusually good mood.
LEADFEMALE:Hitting the ginger ale again? Oh, no, sir.
LEADMALE:I'm high on life.
SUPFEMALE:Just hold on to your fish sticks.
LEADMALE:I had a baby boy.
SUPMALE:A baby? What a completely outdated concept.
LEADMALE:Oh, sir, come on, now.
LEADMALE:I know you're gonna love him because judging by your size, he could be yours.
LEADFEMALE:Sir, I just happen to have a few photographs here with me.
LEADFEMALE:Can I show them to you, please? Here they go.
SUPMALE:Eh-ee.
LEADMALE:Here he is at 2 hours old.
LEADMALE:He seems very alert for a child his age.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, sir.
SUPMALE:Eh-ee.
LEADMALE:Here is his first piggyback ride.
SUPFEMALE:And here's a family portrait.
LEADMALE:Eh-ee.
SUPFEMALE:This one was snapped just before we were airborne.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mork, I must admit, he is rather exceptional.
SUPMALE:Oh, sir, I'm glad you think so.
OTHERMALE:Because Mindy and I want you to be the godfather.
LEADMALE:Me? Absolutely not.
OTHERFEMALE:I am not getting involved in your barbaric Earthling matters.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I see.
SUPFEMALE:He does look a little like me, doesn't he? Well, sir, especially around the equator.
SUPMALE:Oh, a check.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you, godfather.
SUPMALE:Mm-mm.
SUPMALE:Oh, sir.
LEADMALE:Oh, this will assure him of a college education, or at least a hamburger and some onion rings.
SUPFEMALE:Until next week, sir, na-no.
SUPFEMALE:A buck thirty? Such a big man, and he gives so little.
