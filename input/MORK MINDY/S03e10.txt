SUPMALE:You were great last night, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:That benefit concert was really terrific.
SUPMALE:Yeah, and the reviews aren't too bad either.
LEADFEMALE:Here, look.
LEADMALE:There's even a picture of me conducting the orchestra.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's a wonderful likeness of the back of your head.
LEADMALE:Boy, you certainly are in a jolly mood.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, why not? One critic called me the Bald Bernstein of Boulder.
LEADFEMALE:On top of that, we raised over $30,000 for the new Boulder Children's Hospital.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I wish I was doing that well.
LEADMALE:I promised to raise a thousand dollars, but looking for this new job has just taken up all my time.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, you can always rent Mork out to a research laboratory.
LEADMALE:I'm really gonna have to buckle down this next couple of days to raise the money I pledged.
SUPMALE:Maybe I'll dress up as a Girl Scout and go door to door.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it worked when I was 1 2.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing? I think I was sleep-jogging and I locked myself out.
SUPMALE:- How did you do that? - I don't know, I guess kind of like this: Ready, set, dream.
LEADMALE:Idiot delight.
LEADMALE:- Door-ja vu.
OTHERMALE:- Door-ja vu.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, it's Boulder Pops.
LEADMALE:Oh, what a wonderful evening.
SUPMALE:That was incredible.
SUPMALE:I mean, Beverly Sills and everything.
LEADFEMALE:Couldn't you tell it was me in the back going, ''Whoa, get down, mama''? Well, you know, sometimes I can really be irrepressible.
SUPMALE:I don't know why.
LEADMALE:Oh, look, it guessed my weight.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I really should be going.
SUPFEMALE:I've gotta show my picture to the rest of Boulder.
LEADFEMALE:And I'll keep making phone calls for donations.
SUPMALE:I haven't even raised enough money to pay my phone bill.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't worry, honey, you'll raise the money somehow.
LEADMALE:Well, I hope so.
LEADFEMALE:I'll have to disguise the back of my head so I can slip by the groupies.
SUPFEMALE:- Mind, Mind, Mind.
LEADMALE:- Oh, what? Why didn't you tell me that you needed money? You can have anything I own, except for my lips because those are rented.
LEADMALE:That's sweet, but the money's not for me.
OTHERFEMALE:It's for the new children's hospital.
LEADMALE:Mind, you mean, you can get money just by asking for it? Some people donate money to others if they think the cause is worthy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, like ABSCAM.
LEADFEMALE:Senator, do you really believe that you took this as a loan? No, I just thought it was a Christmas gift.
LEADFEMALE:No, not quite.
OTHERFEMALE:See, it's called charity.
OTHERMALE:People raise money in different ways, and then they donate it to people who they feel are in need.
LEADMALE:Remember the telethon we saw the other night? That was wonderful, especially when Monty Hall sang: Bess, you is my woman now Yes.
LEADMALE:Well, people were donating money to that charity.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never understand you Earthlings.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes the lights are on and nobody's home, you know what I'm saying? You've got one wheel in the sand.
SUPFEMALE:We Orkans ask for money, boy, oh, we're-- Right away, right in the institution in a little rubber room going: I'm okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, caring people here like to help others.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, I care and I wanna help.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, I wish you could, Mork.
LEADMALE:I've gotta have those donations in by Friday.
LEADFEMALE:As a matter of fact, I've gotta start making phone calls.
OTHERFEMALE:It shouldn't take that long because you won't have to raise that much money.
LEADMALE:You're building a children's hospital.
LEADFEMALE:It only has to be about this high.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome to Morkathon for Mindy's kids.
LEADMALE:Come on, now.
SUPMALE:I'll stay on here until you give, give, give.
LEADFEMALE:Come on now, little Tommy.
LEADFEMALE:Why am I here? What are you doing to me? No, let's go, let's go now, here we go.
SUPFEMALE:I'd like to bring you my first guest right now.
SUPFEMALE:But first: Hi, hi, hi.
LEADMALE:Don't be afraid of me.
LEADMALE:You know, look, these kids-- Can I say one thing? Here's my first guest.
SUPMALE:Let's bring out a wonderful group.
LEADFEMALE:But first, I'm gonna say, how much have we raised? Diddly.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, let's keep going.
SUPFEMALE:Let's bring on another wonderful act.
LEADFEMALE:The famous Bibbleenees.
SUPMALE:Thank you, thank you, it's so nice to be here.
LEADFEMALE:I want now to do the famous midget juggling.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you very much.
OTHERMALE:And now, please-- No, please, don't, no.
OTHERMALE:Let go.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey, no.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, no.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:What? No, don't touch me there.
LEADMALE:Don't grab me in Hey, my arms.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, thank-- We'll be having a telethon for them in just about an hour, so don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:Let's keep going right now.
SUPMALE:I wanna thank all of you, but first-- A little heart and soul here.
LEADMALE:Let's bring them out right now.
LEADFEMALE:These kids, bring them out.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
LEADFEMALE:We are the Confusions.
LEADFEMALE:We can dance better than we can sing.
SUPFEMALE:I'd like to introduce the band.
OTHERFEMALE:First of all, Larry, proud Aquarius.
LEADMALE:Tom, moon in Encino, I don't know why.
OTHERFEMALE:Billy Bob, I don't know what the hell.
SUPMALE:My agent got me this job.
OTHERMALE:That's it, I'd like to thank all these young people here.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADMALE:We'll be coming around now.
SUPFEMALE:We'll collect money.
SUPFEMALE:- Thank you.
SUPMALE:- How about that, huh? Isn't he terrific, ladies and gentlemen? Mork, what are you doing? I'm doing a telethon to raise money for Mindy's kids.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's real nice.
OTHERMALE:You're scaring away my customers.
SUPMALE:If you keep this up, Mindy's gonna be raising money for me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry about that.
LEADMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:I'll turn in my tie.
OTHERFEMALE:I Excuse me, sir, do you mind if I mope here or is this a no-moping section? No, kid, sure, sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you know something? You got a great approach there, kid.
LEADFEMALE:But you sure got a lot to learn about fundraising.
SUPFEMALE:You know how to raise money? Oh, I'm a professional from back East.
SUPMALE:I raise money every day of my life.
LEADFEMALE:You do? How? - Give me a quarter and I'll show you.
SUPMALE:- Oh, sure.
OTHERMALE:See? I just raised a quarter.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you're slicker than a Teflon banana peel.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy, I didn't even know I was had.
OTHERFEMALE:It was already in my ear.
LEADFEMALE:That was: How do you get a job like that? I admire your thirst for knowledge, kid.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you what, in exchange for a percentage of everything you rake in, I teach you everything I know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really? Oh, that's a great deal, lucille.
LEADFEMALE:No, the name's Godfrey.
OTHERMALE:- What's yours? - Oh, hey, hey, hey.
SUPMALE:I wasn't born yesterday off some turnip truck.
LEADMALE:If you wanna know my name, it's gonna cost a quarter.
LEADFEMALE:All right, my name's Mork and here's your quarter.
LEADMALE:Boy, I'm hotter than a whip, aren't I? The Aspen, Grand Junction and Salt Lake City bus is now loading.
LEADFEMALE:That's the Aspen, Grand Junction and Salt Lake City bus.
SUPFEMALE:Last call for Aspen, Grand Junction and Salt Lake City.
OTHERFEMALE:This is one of my favourite spots.
LEADMALE:Lots of people coming through.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, the first thing we do, we check petty cash.
LEADMALE:Nothing in those.
LEADMALE:Nothing in mine either.
SUPFEMALE:Atten-hut.
LEADFEMALE:Assume the fundraising position.
LEADFEMALE:Perfect.
OTHERFEMALE:- Now, show me what you learned.
LEADMALE:- Oh, gotcha, watch this.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, Hare Krishna, hare lama.
SUPFEMALE:My name is Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- I'm trying to raise money for-- - Who cares? Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Was it something I said? No, it's a rat race out there, kid.
OTHERFEMALE:You wanna raise funds, you gotta give a performance.
LEADMALE:Here, watch a master at work, okay? Excuse me, ma'am.
SUPFEMALE:Could you please spare just a few pennies for a poor destitute soul who is trying to stave off the bitter bite of winter? It is not for myself, you understand, but for my son who is lying-- Oh, bless you, bless you, bless you.
SUPMALE:Godfrey? Godfrey, I didn't know it was that bad.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:Take this, it's all I have.
SUPMALE:It's a picture of Robert Conrad.
SUPFEMALE:It's a picture-- He was real young and he didn't have a battery on his shoulder.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thank you very much, son.
OTHERMALE:I was just acting.
LEADMALE:Oh, wow, De Niro, Moore.
LEADMALE:Raging Bum.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, I tell you, maybe it's better for you to use the flattery approach, you know, butter them up.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, sounds kinky, but I'll give it a try.
LEADMALE:Hello, baby, how are you? My name is Mork Jourdan.
OTHERFEMALE:I would like to design your jeans.
LEADMALE:Someone sprayed those on you, but you look beautiful.
OTHERMALE:You know, you are a very, very beautiful woman.
OTHERMALE:All I can say is that you must be so sweet.
LEADMALE:So, so sweet that I would bake a cake in your name, you know what I'm saying? How are you? Very nice to have met you.
SUPFEMALE:Bless you, madam, bless you.
LEADFEMALE:- What did you get? - Oh, her phone number.
LEADMALE:I'll take that.
LEADFEMALE:I guess the best thing for you, kid, is just to kind of be yourself, you know, say nothing, just look pathetic.
OTHERMALE:Okay, okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Perfect.
SUPFEMALE:Perfect.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter, brother? You down on your luck? Hey, could you use a little something to tide you over? Here, don't be ashamed.
OTHERMALE:No nukes.
LEADMALE:What did you get? How did you do? Kid, you were just great.
LEADFEMALE:You got what it takes.
LEADMALE:And I'll take what you got.
LEADFEMALE:That's for tuition.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, does that enrol me in the school of hard knocks now? Hey, you bet.
LEADFEMALE:This is just the beginning too, remember.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, boy, is Mindy gonna be proud of me, huh? Oh, I'm gonna build that hospital right from the bottom up.
LEADMALE:I hope asking for donations through the mail works a lot better for me than it did for John Anderson.
LEADMALE:Who? See what I mean? Glenda, would you like to switch again or what? No, thanks, I'm fine.
LEADMALE:You know, maybe this would be easier if I use a sponge.
LEADMALE:Oh, sorry, Mork took all our sponges down to the river and set them free.
SUPMALE:He's really got sort of an offbeat sense of compassion, doesn't he? Now, don't you worry, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:You've been putting so much into this fund drive, it's bound to be a success.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, I'd like to make a little contribution to the hospital.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks, Glenda.
SUPMALE:I've been meaning to give this to you.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's really thoughtful.
OTHERMALE:But didn't you put a few too many zeros in this number? No, no, no, it's a very worthy cause.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, I'd only blow the money on T-bills.
LEADFEMALE:Glenda, I don't mean to sound forward or anything, but would you adopt me? - Isn't she adorable? - Oh, she sure is.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Jeanie, we've gotta run.
LEADMALE:It's almost time for racquetball.
LEADMALE:Do you think I'm gonna like this as much as I did bowling? Oh, it doesn't matter.
LEADFEMALE:The clothes are a lot cuter.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, you guys, thanks a lot for your help.
LEADMALE:- Good luck, see you later.
LEADFEMALE:- Bye, okay.
SUPMALE:Well, back to work.
LEADFEMALE:No rest for the perky.
LEADMALE:Eureka, Mind.
SUPMALE:Mind, what's wrong? I just swallowed a stamp.
OTHERMALE:Well, quick, swallow a letter.
LEADFEMALE:Where did you get those clothes? Bowery Brothers.
SUPFEMALE:It's a little boutique on Skid Drive.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, boy, you're gonna be so happy.
LEADFEMALE:Not only are we gonna build a wing, we're gonna build a wing and a thigh.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, what Earth concept have you misunderstood this week? No, I didn't misunderstand.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll be proud of me.
SUPFEMALE:I've mastered fundraising.
LEADMALE:Watch this, watch this.
OTHERMALE:Give me a dollar.
LEADFEMALE:You mean, you bummed all this money? Oh, not bummed, Mind, no, it's an art form.
SUPMALE:I would've brought home more except there are holes in my pocket and I had to help some friends out, get them a little libation.
LEADMALE:But that's panhandling.
SUPMALE:No, Mind, panhandling is what nurses do in the hospital.
LEADMALE:I'm an individualised self-help fundraiser.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'm getting a headache real soon.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, you want me to bum you an aspirin? Give me an aspirin.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, begging isn't the right way to collect money.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, but my friend, Godfrey, said-- Oh, Mork, look at you.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't-- lt's just-- It's so humili-- It's so embarrassing.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, now I really have a headache.
LEADFEMALE:I guess that means you won't be able to have dinner at the mission.
LEADMALE:That's too bad because I already selected a wonderful wine.
LEADMALE:Look, here.
LEADFEMALE:It says: ''Mount Thunder Wazola.
OTHERMALE:'' Oh, come on, Mind, come on.
LEADMALE:I like you.
LEADFEMALE:You're pretty.
OTHERMALE:- Mind? - Not yet, Mork.
LEADMALE:Okay, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, now I'm ready.
OTHERMALE:- Mork? - Present.
SUPMALE:Now, I realise I realise that you are a creature from outer space.
SUPFEMALE:- ''Creature'' is a little rough, isn't it? - Not at the moment.
OTHERMALE:Why do I feel like I'm sitting next to Mount St.
LEADMALE:Mindy's? Now, I realise that you are a creature from outer space, but there are certain things that even the Blob wouldn't do.
OTHERFEMALE:I just wanted to raise money for your hospital.
LEADFEMALE:I know, Mork, but begging in the bus station where all my friends could see you? It wasn't all your friends, Mind.
LEADMALE:It was just six of them.
SUPMALE:Besides, they were only good for $20.
LEADFEMALE:You panhandled from my friends? Oh, I'm gonna crawl under a rock.
SUPMALE:You did the same thing.
LEADFEMALE:I was just a little bit more creative.
SUPFEMALE:- What's the difference? - There's a big difference, Mork.
OTHERMALE:In the first place, I wasn't asking for myself.
LEADMALE:I was asking for other people.
SUPFEMALE:Well, so was I.
LEADFEMALE:People at the bus station didn't know that.
SUPMALE:Panhandlers usually keep the money for themselves.
LEADMALE:My friend, Godfrey, my mentor said, ''We have to take the direct approach.
LEADMALE:We're gonna build a new society where you don't have a middleman.
LEADMALE:'' Your friend and mentor is a bum.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, shattered illusion.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:No more, Mindy, no more.
LEADMALE:You've hurt me to the quick.
LEADMALE:What I meant was what your friend does is called begging.
LEADFEMALE:And on Earth, begging isn't exactly in.
LEADMALE:And only derelicts beg.
SUPMALE:I thought everybody on Earth begged.
OTHERMALE:I mean, in court you beg for mercy.
SUPMALE:Politicians beg the issue, people beg off.
LEADMALE:I mean, you even teach your dog to beg, Mind.
SUPMALE:- Oh, Mork, it's not the same thing.
SUPFEMALE:- Beg your pardon? I appreciate what you're trying to do, but begging just isn't right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I didn't mean to embarrass you.
LEADFEMALE:Just don't do any more panhandling, okay? - Okay.
SUPFEMALE:- Good.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, now I gotta get these in the mail.
SUPFEMALE:Look, while I'm gone, I think maybe you should glance over your Earth manual again.
OTHERFEMALE:Only this time, try reading it, don't just colour the pictures.
LEADMALE:Step right up, everybody, we're giving away free money here.
LEADFEMALE:Let me give you a dollar.
LEADFEMALE:Please, now, come on, free money.
SUPFEMALE:Pardon me, have a fistful of dollars.
SUPFEMALE:Sink right in there.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry about that.
SUPFEMALE:I can't even give this stuff away.
SUPMALE:Oh, where's a mugger when you really need him? Excuse me, sir, do you have any spare change? - No, I don't.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, now you do.
SUPMALE:- Come here, there you go.
SUPMALE:- Thanks.
OTHERMALE:Oh, gee, thanks, mister.
SUPMALE:Hey, you're a saint.
LEADMALE:- Hey, bless you.
SUPFEMALE:- This fruitcake is giving away money.
LEADMALE:Hold it, hold it, hold it.
SUPMALE:Hey, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Don't you dare.
LEADMALE:You leave that.
LEADMALE:What's going on here? Well, I was just giving the money back.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't it beautiful? Are you bonkers? You're supposed to take handouts, not give them away.
SUPFEMALE:I know, but I heard it's better to give than to receive.
SUPFEMALE:You should try it yourself, Godfrey.
OTHERFEMALE:Never.
SUPFEMALE:I can't understand it.
LEADFEMALE:I did everything I could for you.
LEADFEMALE:I treated you like you were my own flesh and blood.
SUPMALE:I kicked you out of the house, I threw you in the gutter and I made a bum out of you.
LEADMALE:Where did I go wrong? Godfrey, it's only money.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's like an Arab saying, ''It's only oil.
SUPMALE:'' Money's the most important thing in the world.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you understand? It's much too valuable to give away.
LEADMALE:Oh, if I had known you felt like that, I mean, whoa.
SUPFEMALE:Well, here, Godfrey, this is all I've got left.
SUPMALE:It's a McGovern-Eagleton button.
LEADFEMALE:Kid, I'm real disappointed in you.
LEADMALE:Godfrey.
LEADMALE:It's people like you that give bums a bad name.
LEADMALE:You gave the money back? You said I got the money in a way that wasn't socially acceptable to middle-class mores.
SUPFEMALE:- I said that? - Well, not as eloquently.
OTHERMALE:What I meant was it's wrong to beg for money unless it's for a worthy cause.
LEADFEMALE:Then it's not begging, it's charity.
LEADMALE:First I get the money wrong, then I give it back wrong.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, this place is really perplexing.
LEADMALE:I mean, no wonder psychiatrists drive Mercedes.
LEADMALE:Who can stay mad at puppies or Orkans? Godfrey, come on in.
SUPMALE:- Hi, kid.
LEADFEMALE:- Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, this is my financial advisor, Godfrey.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I've heard a lot about you, Godfrey.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Come on in, make yourself at home.
LEADFEMALE:I'll put some newspapers on the couch.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, don't bother.
SUPMALE:This ain't gonna take but a minute.
SUPFEMALE:You know, kid, earlier today, I was sure you was the biggest sucker I had ever met in my whole life.
LEADMALE:Oh, shucks.
LEADFEMALE:But, you know, after you left that bus station, I got to thinking, and I saw this little girl standing there crying because she was lost.
OTHERMALE:Suddenly it hit me, you know, money, money don't mean nothing if I can change that little girl's life.
OTHERMALE:Right then and there, I decided to make the big sacrifice.
LEADMALE:What did you do? I gave her a dime so she could call her mother.
SUPFEMALE:And I tell you, the look on that girl's face made me feel so good.
LEADMALE:I started thinking how good I would feel if I could help a lot of kids, you know? So Here, that's for your hospital.
OTHERMALE:- You're making a donation? - Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:You're welcome.
SUPMALE:Godfrey, you have to let it go now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this is very generous of you, Godfrey.
SUPMALE:Now I can almost make my pledge.
LEADMALE:Almost? What do you mean, you're still short? Only $40.
SUPMALE:Oh, boy, this is gonna be painful.
LEADMALE:This is wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, you born-again bum.
SUPMALE:Come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Just don't spread that around, will you? I've worked too hard to get where I am.
LEADMALE:- Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:- I'll be seeing you.
LEADMALE:- Oh, can I walk you to the gutter? - No.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Have you ever thought of maybe taking on a little responsibility? You know, getting a job and kind of settling down? Getting married.
SUPMALE:Raising kids, send them through college.
LEADMALE:I did all that.
SUPFEMALE:That's how I got to be a bum.
OTHERMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in, my favourite superior being.
LEADMALE:- Let's hear your report, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Yes, sir.
LEADMALE:And in the centre ring, it's the incredible, shrinking dollar.
LEADFEMALE:You can spend it, you can save it, you can waste it, but you can't take it with you.
LEADMALE:No, sirree, bobcat tail.
OTHERMALE:You've already made a report on money and how Earthlings love to hoard it, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes, sir.
LEADMALE:This week, I learned about a very generous act called charity.
SUPFEMALE:There's another side to the coin.
SUPMALE:How about that for a nifty metaphor, Beeb? Little Beebs, little shilly.
SUPMALE:- Get to the point, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Yes, sir.
SUPFEMALE:See, sir, charity is a concept whereby Earthlings with money help those without it.
OTHERMALE:It's a return investment where you take a loss, but you reap a higher dividend.
LEADMALE:l thought you told me that a fool and his money were soon parted.
LEADMALE:Well, that's one saying, sir, but the other one is: ''It's better to give than to receive.
LEADFEMALE:'' That's why there's a Thanksgiving Day and not a Thanksgetting Day, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Most of all, sir, I learned that the buck starts right here.
LEADFEMALE:Until next week, sir.
