LEADFEMALE:Na-no, na-no.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I gotta go, Mork.
OTHERMALE:Keep your fingers crossed for me.
SUPMALE:Or whatever you Orkans do for luck.
LEADMALE:Oh, look at all the flowers.
OTHERMALE:Mork, the room looks beautiful.
OTHERMALE:I know, Mind, and not a single Medfly in the bunch.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:- Titter, titter, blush, blush, blush.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, this is so sweet of you to do this for me.
SUPMALE:But you're a little premature.
OTHERMALE:I'm not gonna know about the newscaster job till this afternoon.
SUPFEMALE:But thanks.
SUPMALE:Oh, down, boy.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, down, boy, down, boy.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind Go ahead tell her.
LEADFEMALE:No, I can't.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, tell her.
LEADMALE:Tell her.
LEADFEMALE:I can't.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, tell her.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm cramping up emotionally.
LEADMALE:Just tell her.
OTHERFEMALE:You can do it.
LEADFEMALE:Tell her, tell her Mork, I'm gonna have to wait later.
LEADMALE:Sorry, wait.
SUPMALE:I'm Oh, wait.
SUPMALE:Just tell her.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell her.
SUPFEMALE:It's okay.
OTHERFEMALE:It's all right.
OTHERMALE:Mindy, you hold my three hearts in your two hands.
LEADFEMALE:Basically, what I'd like to say is, will you marry me, Mind? Mind? The shiksa split.
SUPFEMALE:Make a small mental note: It's always better to propose while she's in the room.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork? - Mind, oh, you say the magic words.
LEADFEMALE:Roast.
SUPMALE:Don't forget to put it in the oven.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:All that love for a hunk of meat.
LEADMALE:I blew my big moment.
SUPFEMALE:I was there.
SUPFEMALE:I blew it.
SUPMALE:Fore! This is not the American embassy! Mind if I play through? Exidor, is that you? That's what it says on my scorecard.
LEADMALE:Try a five iron? Pepe, that's why you're a caddy and I'm on the tour.
OTHERFEMALE:I always like playing this course.
LEADFEMALE:So well-tended.
SUPMALE:Those are for Mindy.
SUPMALE:I tried to propose to her.
LEADMALE:- What did she say? - Put the roast in the oven.
SUPMALE:So that's where it goes.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you can join me on my crusade.
SUPMALE:I'm going to take golf from the rich and give it to the poor.
LEADMALE:We'll play in the streets with real hazards, like gang violence and mopeds.
SUPMALE:Exidor, you've got to help me, please.
SUPMALE:I mean, you know everything.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you even know the color of Ronald Reagan's real hair.
SUPMALE:Please, please, how do? How do I propose to Mindy? Ditch the skirt, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, but I love Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't marriage the ultimate commitment, the eternal bond, besides a wicked tax break? It's a sham.
LEADFEMALE:- It's a blessing.
LEADMALE:- It's barbaric.
LEADFEMALE:- It's fulfilling.
LEADFEMALE:- It's a candy mint.
LEADFEMALE:- It's a breath mint.
LEADMALE:- Oh, stop.
LEADFEMALE:We're both right.
SUPFEMALE:Exidor, please, please, pull out your putter and drive me out of this sand trap of life into the fairway of love.
LEADMALE:Mork, there's only two ways to propose.
SUPMALE:B, the old-fashioned way.
LEADFEMALE:You charge into her life on a fiery white stallion, toss the tomato on the back of the saddle and ride off into the sunset.
LEADFEMALE:I guess the old-fashioned way is always best unless you're having a heart transplant, but Well, then you're stuck with C.
LEADMALE:- I don't mean to pry, but what's C? - Hmm? - C? - Oh, C.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mork, I must say that it's a boring choice, but it worked for Prince Charles.
OTHERFEMALE:I look a lot less like Howdy Doody than he does.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:This may shock and even nauseate you.
OTHERMALE:That's all right.
SUPMALE:I subscribe to the National Enquirer.
LEADMALE:Bunny, I may not be the handsomest man, or the brightest, or the wealthiest man in the world, but I've got his phone number.
LEADMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see.
SUPMALE:Did she come in yet? Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:On your mark, get set, propose.
LEADMALE:- Mindy, l - You know, sometimes I wish I was the garbage man, when they wake up in the morning, they expect the world to stink.
LEADMALE:Mind, although we've only known each other now for 26,802 hours, I feel basically Well, I didn't get the newscaster job.
LEADMALE:But am I bitter? No.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Sternhagen said it had nothing to do with my being a woman, it's just that he needed a shortstop for the station's softball team.
LEADMALE:Mind It's hard to propose to a moving target.
OTHERMALE:Mind.
LEADMALE:- Mindy - Oh, I gotta get my mind off this.
LEADFEMALE:I know, let's go do something fun.
OTHERFEMALE:You wanna play tennis? - Oh, l - Or we'll do anything.
SUPMALE:I'd love to play "Space Invaders.
LEADMALE:" Go for some pizza, maybe get married.
OTHERFEMALE:No, we had Italian food last night.
SUPFEMALE:Cute, but not the greatest attention span.
OTHERFEMALE:Eenie, meenie, minie, mo, you die.
OTHERFEMALE:- Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:- Mind, you know, I've traveled all around the galaxy, and I never thought I'd fall for an Earthling.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I don't think I know a nicer or kinder being than you.
LEADMALE:I love you very much, and will you marry me? Mind? Hon, don't check out without the baggage.
OTHERMALE:Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Mind.
LEADMALE:Little Pooter.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:Mind.
SUPMALE:Hello, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:- What's wrong with Mindy? - I don't know, Grams.
LEADMALE:All I did was ask her to marry me and, boom, she's got the personality of lint.
SUPFEMALE:- Marry? - Yes, sir, I think Marry my daughter? Oh, yes, thank you for your blessing.
LEADMALE:Blessing? I'll give you a blessing.
OTHERFEMALE:Wouldn't hit a man standing behind a woman wearing glasses, would you? Married.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I think that we three should have a talk right now.
OTHERFEMALE:- Come on.
LEADFEMALE:- Okay.
LEADMALE:I don't think we should neglect Mindy like this.
LEADFEMALE:- Honey, come on.
OTHERMALE:- Hi, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Pops, wherever Mindy goes, I go, because basically we're a unit, right? Okay, but since we're almost family, I can make one exception.
SUPFEMALE:Now, honey, let me see if I can I can say this tactfully.
LEADFEMALE:Mork is an alien.
LEADMALE:He's an extraterrestrial being.
LEADFEMALE:A UFO with legs.
OTHERMALE:Oh, pipe down, Fredzo.
SUPMALE:You don't mind having that alien sit on your television so you can bring in A television antenna is one thing, a son-in-law is another.
LEADFEMALE:Don't talk to me about a son-in-law.
OTHERMALE:Come on, you two.
OTHERMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Technically, we all know Mork isn't exactly human, but he has a lot more humanity in him than anyone I've ever met.
LEADFEMALE:He's sweet, he's charming, he's sensitive, and I love him.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Mindy, you loved Oliver too, but you got over him.
LEADFEMALE:Oliver was a goldfish.
OTHERMALE:And he went belly-up.
SUPFEMALE:Will you talk some sense into him, please? Oh, Mindy dear, we all love Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, and we don't mind if he still likes to chase cars or sit on his face, but you see, you mustn't let love spoil your judgment.
OTHERFEMALE:Mindy, any mixed marriage is rough.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, but I'm afraid this one is impossible.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, look at the facts.
LEADMALE:Mork can never support you.
SUPFEMALE:So I'll be the breadwinner.
OTHERMALE:I want a career.
OTHERFEMALE:What happens to your career if he's transferred to another planet? I'll commute.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, think.
LEADFEMALE:Mork is an Orkan and he's aging backwards.
LEADFEMALE:You'll be on Medicare, he'll be on pablum.
OTHERMALE:Dear, you will never be able to have a normal life.
SUPFEMALE:And what about having a family? The chances are, you can't.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy, we don't like to see you cheated out of having something as precious as children.
LEADMALE:Honey, it's your decision, and we just want you to be realistic.
SUPMALE:And sometimes that's the hardest thing in the world.
SUPFEMALE:I always thought my life would be like a Doris Day movie, not Barbarella.
OTHERFEMALE:How do I weigh what I feel against what I know is logical? Honey, I think you know exactly what has to be done.
LEADFEMALE:Will you folks talk a little louder? I can't hear a word you're saying! This is gonna be a lot harder than it was to flush Oliver down the toilet.
OTHERFEMALE:Mind, you've been in there all night.
LEADFEMALE:Are you gonna come out? Yes.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:She said, "Yes.
SUPMALE:" Mind, Mind, Mind.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, Mind, Mind, Mind, look.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork.
SUPMALE:Wait, wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, it's a beautiful ring.
LEADMALE:- Look at the jewels, they're sparkling.
OTHERMALE:- Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:- They're glittering.
SUPMALE:- Mm-hm.
SUPFEMALE:- They're moving.
OTHERMALE:- Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Those are his eyes.
LEADFEMALE:He's blinking.
LEADFEMALE:- Him? He's alive? - Yep.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't do that.
LEADMALE:You'll give him whiplash.
OTHERFEMALE:See, the nice thing about it is, if you drop it, he'll follow you home.
SUPMALE:It's a very nice ring, but I can't accept it.
LEADMALE:You don't want the engagement ring? - Oh, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Mind? It's not the ring.
SUPMALE:See, Mork, sometimes in life, no matter how much you dream or you wish for something, it just can't be.
LEADFEMALE:I guess what I'm really trying to say is, I can't marry you.
LEADMALE:Pshaw, Mind, it's a joke, right, like the volunteer Army? Rejection.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:You don't wanna be Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Mork? Mind, Mind, Mind, but Mind, will you give me one reason why we can't get married, bicker, and learn to play canasta for the rest of our lives? I can't lie to you, and it really hurts me to have to say this.
LEADMALE:- It's because you're an alien.
SUPMALE:- And? And? And that's it.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you see? We're from two completely different worlds.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, Mind, that never affected, like, Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier.
LEADMALE:I mean, Pocahontas and John Smith, or Mickey Rooney and pick-a-number.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, come on now.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, I'm not gonna give up.
LEADMALE:- No way, like glue, I'm stuck on you.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, come on.
SUPMALE:Deep down inside, you know there's probably a barrier that shouldn't be crossed.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but you said you loved me, you know, love me.
LEADMALE:You know, L-O-V-V.
SUPMALE:Mork, I said that and I meant it, but I'm sorry, my mind is made up.
LEADMALE:Oh, but, Mind, you took more time to make up your mind about your bathroom wallpaper.
SUPMALE:I mean more to you than that, don't I? You do.
SUPMALE:Well, just Well, just take some time, you know? I mean, just 24 hours.
LEADMALE:Please, Mind, Mind, Mind, please.
LEADMALE:Please, oh, please, oh, please All right.
LEADMALE:Tell you what, tell you what.
LEADFEMALE:It's 11:59 now.
SUPMALE:Because I like what you stand for even when you're sitting, I'll give you the extra minute and make it midnight tomorrow night.
LEADMALE:Okay, but I can't promise anything.
LEADFEMALE:- Right.
OTHERFEMALE:- All right.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Remember, you changed your mind about the wallpaper.
LEADMALE:Mork promo, take one.
LEADFEMALE:You will marry Mork.
OTHERMALE:You love Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Mork loves you.
LEADFEMALE:Mork is great.
LEADFEMALE:He's a today kind of guy.
SUPFEMALE:Lock up when you leave.
SUPFEMALE:- Jake? - Hmm? Let's have a heart-to-heart talk.
LEADFEMALE:You and I haven't had one for a long time.
SUPMALE:We never had one.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then I guess we're overdue.
OTHERFEMALE:See, I have this really important decision that I have to make in about two hours.
SUPFEMALE:Now, logically, I know what the answer should be, but emotionally, I feel exactly the opposite.
LEADMALE:You've been around for a while.
LEADMALE:What do you usually do? Do you think with your head or with your heart? Mindy, a lot of people think of me as just old Jake the cameraman, that I care about nothing except staying in focus and going home early.
LEADMALE:They think I don't care about anybody else's problems because nobody cares about mine.
OTHERMALE:Well, you know something? They're right.
SUPFEMALE:Never did like Old Jake.
SUPMALE:Mork, what are you doing? Mind, I've come to sweep you off your feet.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:- Give me your foot.
OTHERFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:Ugh.
OTHERMALE:Big lunch, Mind? This is ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's romantic.
SUPMALE:We're gonna ride off into the sunset.
LEADFEMALE:The sun set four hours ago.
LEADMALE:I guess we better haul it then.
LEADMALE:- Mork - Mind, Mind, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mork! That's all right, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I'll catch the next one.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you really topped yourself that time, Mork.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I guess you've never ridden a pony through a car wash before, huh? Boy, he scampered when he hit that hot wax.
SUPFEMALE:You haven't had a date like that with an earthman.
SUPMALE:You're right there.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, it's almost midnight.
LEADMALE:I think we should sit down and talk.
OTHERMALE:Mind, there's enough time for the grand finale.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, you don't need a finale.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I sure do, and you'll love this.
LEADMALE:Put the tape in the tape recorder down there, please.
SUPMALE:- This one marked Last Ditch Effort? - That's it.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, you've given me flowers and perfume and horses.
LEADFEMALE:What's left? Broadway! Hit it, Mind.
LEADMALE:Got my top hat Got my vest pressed All I need now is the girl Got my striped tie Got my hopes high Got the time and the place And I've got rhythm All I need now is the girl to go with Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, ho.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, they really screwed this game up when they added the ball, Mind.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, no, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Mind.
LEADMALE:You see this guy This guy's in love with you Seriously, where are you from? Yes, I'm in love What do I do to make you mine? You know it.
LEADMALE:Tell me now Is it so? Don't let me be the last to know Because I want to be happy But I won't be happy Till I make you happy too Oh, no, Mindy, no.
LEADFEMALE:Life's really worth living When you are mirth givin' Why can't I give some to you? You know it's true, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork.
SUPMALE:Did I close out of town? Oh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Before I met you, the biggest choice I had to make in my life was whether to have my hair permed or fix the cat.
SUPFEMALE:This is the hardest decision I've ever had to make.
SUPMALE:Maybe the decision's been made for you, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, think about it.
SUPFEMALE:I crossed five galaxies, came to this little tiny planet and out of all those people in the world, you found me and we fell in love.
LEADFEMALE:Coincidence? I say nay.
LEADMALE:Maybe some infinite intelligence in this cosmos as we peer out, realizes that we were meant to be married and all mankind.
LEADFEMALE:I wish I could believe that.
LEADMALE:I wish you could believe that too, Mind.
LEADMALE:I'll send by Exidor to pick up my clothes.
SUPFEMALE:Why? You don't have to go.
LEADMALE:I don't want you to go.
LEADMALE:You could go, but the lease is in your name.
LEADMALE:Just because we can't be married doesn't mean we have to end our relationship.
OTHERMALE:I mean, why can't we just go on being the way we are? I love you.
SUPFEMALE:I couldn't stay here knowing that you'll never be mine.
LEADMALE:But it doesn't have to be like that.
LEADFEMALE:If it were the other way around, could you stay? No.
SUPMALE:Well, big kiss.
LEADMALE:I know how easily you run down, so don't skip breakfast.
SUPMALE:And don't forget to take your Femiron.
LEADMALE:- Mork.
SUPMALE:- Yeah? Goodbye.
LEADMALE:Mork.
OTHERMALE:You don't want me to go, do you? You can read minds too? No, but I can read your face.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, if I married you, I'd be giving up any chance I might have to have a normal life.
OTHERMALE:But if I lost you - Will you marry me? - What? Will you marry me? This is so sudden.
SUPMALE:I'll need some time.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Your Battle of the Bulgeness.
LEADMALE:- Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Sir.
SUPMALE:Do you always have to report when I'm eating? Well, sir, I could wait, but the Earth's sun does have a limited lifespan.
SUPMALE:After that comment, you'd better have an interesting report.
LEADMALE:Well, sir, you're gonna decorate me for this one.
LEADMALE:You see, Mindy and I have signed up for a full lifetime term in the most noble of all institutions, marriage.
LEADMALE:What? Sir? Do I detect a note of jealousy or are you coughing on a bone? Mork, no Orkan has entered into a marriage since our dark ages.
LEADFEMALE:You've broken one of our most fundamental Orkan laws.
LEADMALE:Correct the matter at once.
LEADFEMALE:All right, sir.
LEADFEMALE:I'll correct the problem.
OTHERMALE:I quit.
LEADMALE:I abdicate my post for the woman I love.
SUPMALE:Mork, you can't abdicate.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm giving you an order.
LEADMALE:- Carry it out or else.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, yeah? I'm marrying Mindy and you just try and stop me.
OTHERMALE:That's a nice try there, sir.
OTHERMALE:Don't you understand though? On Earth when man and woman love each other - Silence! - Sir.
SUPFEMALE:The matter is closed.
LEADMALE:Until next week, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Na-no.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, all right.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:The old silent treatment, eh? I am staying right on this spot until you let me marry Mindy.
OTHERMALE:I have patience.
LEADFEMALE:I can wait.
LEADFEMALE:I once sat through an entire Bobby Vinton concert.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
