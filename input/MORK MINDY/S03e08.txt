OTHERMALE:Cathy, I was just saying to Dad that we hardly get a chance to see you two anymore, you're gone so often.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:I have missed our wicked little stepmother-stepdaughter talks.
LEADMALE:But it really has been a busy concert season.
SUPMALE:I'll say, Cathy plays wonderful flute.
SUPMALE:But maybe I've been working her too hard.
OTHERFEMALE:Lately, she's been eating her celery like this: Hey, you didn't finish your eggplant.
SUPFEMALE:All right, shoot it to me straight.
SUPFEMALE:It's too spicy, too much garlic, not enough rosemary.
OTHERMALE:Is that right? No, it was delicious, Remo, I'm just watching my figure.
LEADMALE:You don't have to.
LEADFEMALE:Every guy in the place is watching it for you.
SUPMALE:You lucky old dog, you.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't mean old.
LEADMALE:I meant Well, you're older than me.
OTHERMALE:Well, excuse me while I go away flustered.
SUPFEMALE:What's happened to Mork? Wasn't he going out to check the movie times? The phone's right outside, it shouldn't take him 20 minutes to call the theatre.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, I'm so excited.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna go see a movie.
LEADMALE:I hope it's a musical comedy with an RR rating.
LEADMALE:Well, what took you so long? Well, I was on the phone with this wonderful woman.
SUPMALE:She gave me all the times for the theatres.
LEADMALE:I would've been here earlier, except she kept repeating herself, and I didn't wanna hang up.
OTHERFEMALE:It might be rude.
SUPMALE:Mork, I think that was a recording.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Well, it'll never make the top ten.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's got a nice beat, but it's hard to dance to.
SUPFEMALE:I've got all the theatre times right here, Mind.
LEADMALE:There are 1 4 theatres where it's playing.
LEADMALE:At Cinema 1 , at 6, 8, and 1 0.
LEADMALE:Cinema 2 at 7, 9 and 1 1 .
SUPFEMALE:- Cinema 3 at-- - What time does our movie start? - I'll get back to you in 20 minutes.
OTHERMALE:- No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just drive over there and take our chances.
OTHERMALE:You know, Mork, I can never tell when you're serious.
LEADMALE:Oh, neither can I, but it's usually when I go like this: - I'm looking forward to seeing 1 0.
SUPMALE:- 1 0? If I'd known we were gonna see 1 0, I'd have my suspenders cornrowed.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I saw the movie when Fred was out of town, and it's so funny I wanted him to see it too.
OTHERMALE:That sounds a little far-fetched.
SUPMALE:I mean, who would believe an attractive, young woman falling for an older, middle-aged man Well, maybe art does tend to imitate life.
LEADFEMALE:Fred? Fred McConnell? Bob Turnbow.
LEADFEMALE:- I haven't seen you since high school.
LEADFEMALE:- Hey.
SUPMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Say, I'd like you to meet my wife, Cathy, and my daughter, Mindy, and my Mork.
LEADFEMALE:That's me, na-no.
SUPFEMALE:- Pleased to meet you, Bob.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi.
SUPFEMALE:God, Fred, your wife, she's beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Very beautiful.
OTHERMALE:Hey, you old dog.
LEADMALE:How did you meet her? Was she helping you cross the street? Just kidding.
LEADMALE:I always have enjoyed your sense of humour, Bob.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, me too, Bob.
LEADFEMALE:Look under the hat for another surprise.
LEADMALE:Bob.
LEADMALE:Say, Bob, you know, it's amazing, but you look the same as you did years ago.
LEADFEMALE:Exactly the same.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll tell you my secret, Fred.
SUPMALE:Plastic surgery.
LEADFEMALE:Changed my whole life.
LEADFEMALE:I improved my best parts and threw out all the rest.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, I gotta run.
SUPFEMALE:Say goodbye to that beautiful young wife of yours, will you? Listen, I'm sorry I gotta fly, but I'm meeting my date at Rawhide's.
LEADFEMALE:We're riding double on the mechanical bull.
LEADFEMALE:Yahoo.
SUPFEMALE:Improved his best parts.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd be happy with what he threw away.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, cheer up, Pops.
LEADMALE:You know, wine improves with age, cheese improves with age.
LEADFEMALE:It's not your fault that you're not wine or cheese.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Beebs, try another trick.
OTHERFEMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Play dead.
OTHERMALE:Oh, those amazing noggachomps.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wonderful, Bebo.
SUPMALE:You was rigour mortis there-- There's an Earthling at the door, Beebs.
SUPFEMALE:Either slip into your Boomer costume or take a hike.
LEADMALE:Come on, Beebs.
SUPFEMALE:Beebs, hurry.
LEADFEMALE:Go on, fetch.
SUPMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:- Pops.
LEADMALE:- Oh, hi, Mork.
LEADMALE:Is Mindy home? Oh, no.
LEADMALE:She's in the tub right now with Mr.
SUPMALE:Suds.
SUPFEMALE:What I wanna talk to her about, it's kind of personal.
LEADMALE:Personal? Oh, I see.
LEADMALE:It's part of your McConnell life that I can't McShare.
LEADFEMALE:It's all right.
LEADMALE:I understand after I insulted you last night at the restaurant that Well, even though I was doing it in friendship that I can accept this, I can.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I can accept it.
LEADMALE:I can even live with it.
SUPMALE:He hates me.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:- No, no, no.
SUPMALE:- I don't need your pity.
LEADMALE:- Mork, Mork, Mork.
LEADMALE:I didn't mean to offend you, I just I'm just troubled about something.
LEADMALE:Oh, I've always hoped that you'd look to me as a son, because I've always looked to you as, well, Mindy's father.
LEADFEMALE:Let's seize this moment to make our relationship closer.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me in, Fred.
LEADFEMALE:Well Okay.
LEADMALE:Now, this is just between you and me, Mork.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:I've been to a plastic surgeon.
LEADMALE:Why? Couldn't you find a real one? She is a real one.
LEADFEMALE:Dr.
LEADMALE:Charlotte Dubin, she's one of the best.
OTHERMALE:You see, I'm 1 5 years older than Cathy.
SUPMALE:And while I can't make myself her age, I can make myself a lot younger.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you mean, you humans can change your appearance.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this will make an interesting report to Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure, everybody's doing it.
LEADMALE:You can lift your eyes, and fill in your chin, and fill out your cheeks.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's wonderful.
LEADMALE:Could they move your nose down here? It'd be convenient next to your hanky.
SUPMALE:I'm doing this for Cathy.
OTHERMALE:I spent a lot of years alone.
LEADMALE:And now that I have her, I'm gonna do anything I can to keep her interested in me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Pops.
LEADMALE:I mean, I'm sure she likes you the way you are.
SUPMALE:I do.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Mork.
SUPMALE:Oh, shucks and wazoo, you know? But there's nothing wrong in looking your best, especially for somebody you love.
LEADMALE:Well, anyway, thanks for listening, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure you don't wanna tell Mind? lt's wonderful news.
LEADFEMALE:On second thought, l've gotten it off my chest now.
SUPMALE:l'll just save it for later and surprise her.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you've really helped me make up my mind.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow at 4:00, I'm gonna be a new man.
LEADMALE:Well, now that we've helped you remove your troubles, there's something I've always wondered about.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think Orson Welles should be made into a national park? You know, I've often wondered about that too.
LEADMALE:So long, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mork.
LEADMALE:Have you seen my eyeliner pencil? Oh, yes.
SUPMALE:I was using it to play connect-the-dot on my chest.
LEADMALE:It was amazing.
LEADFEMALE:It made this picture of Marie Osmond with hairy teeth.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet it did.
OTHERMALE:Well, I need it to complete my makeup.
SUPMALE:Makeup.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, would you stain the Painted Desert? Would you flock the giant redwoods? Would you fill the Grand Canyon with Cheez Whiz? I say, nay, nay, nay.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, well, thank you very much.
LEADMALE:No, no, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:You see, you're very, very special.
OTHERMALE:I mean, the way your nose kind of veers to the left.
LEADFEMALE:And the way your eyes sparkle, especially the greener one.
LEADMALE:The way your chin comes to that point, so convenient for opening beer cans.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thank you, Mork, but we all could use a little improvement.
OTHERFEMALE:Especially for those you care about.
LEADMALE:Right, Mind? - Right.
LEADMALE:- Mind - Remember the movie we saw, 1 0? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:Who's your perfect ten? Well, present company excepted.
SUPMALE:Oh, bless you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess there are always the old standbys: Newman, Redford and Cronkite.
SUPFEMALE:But I always thought that I always thought that maybe I'd like to meet a guy like my dad.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess through my eyes, he's always sort of been the perfect ten to me.
LEADMALE:I gotta dry my hair, I'm gonna be late.
LEADMALE:Oh, allow me, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Allow me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you do hair too? Oh, honey, I do anything I can.
SUPMALE:Wash up for you now here.
SUPMALE:Let's just give you a little blow-dry here.
LEADFEMALE:That's all we can afford today.
LEADFEMALE:Let's work on it now.
LEADMALE:First, we'll tease it.
LEADMALE:Yesterday, this woman came in and she said: ''Make me look like Cheryl Tiegs.
LEADMALE:'' I said, ''Honey, I'm a beautician, not a magician.
OTHERMALE:'' Come on, now.
LEADMALE:Boy, she-- I can tell you.
LEADMALE:She wanted me to give her a facial.
LEADMALE:I said, ''I don't have a sandblaster.
LEADMALE:'' Oh, whoa, this is incredible.
SUPMALE:I looked at this other lady came in, and she liked to look like the Bo Derek.
LEADMALE:So I said to her, I put like magnetic beads in her hair, and she followed a bus for a mile.
LEADMALE:That's it, one more blow-dry.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, there you are, you're all done.
LEADMALE:Get back on the street.
LEADMALE:- Oh, thank you, Mr.
LEADMALE:Mork.
SUPMALE:- Oh, bless you, child.
LEADFEMALE:- Thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:- Bless you.
OTHERMALE:Susan B.
LEADMALE:Anthony.
SUPMALE:Well, I guess I could use a little improvement.
LEADMALE:All those years of sitting on my face are beginning to show.
OTHERFEMALE:I never should have sat on wicker.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess this is it.
SUPMALE:Pops said I should do it for someone I care about.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I'll do it for Mind.
LEADMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:That's right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna do it.
SUPMALE:Mork's new look.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I'll be like Dianne von Secondburg.
OTHERFEMALE:Will someone loosen my hair so I can blink? You have to let them know you're here.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:I'm here! Oh, voice-activated shutters.
LEADFEMALE:May I help you? Oh, yes.
OTHERMALE:Hello, doc.
SUPFEMALE:- I've got a list of changes I'd like done.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, no, I'm not Dr.
LEADMALE:Dubin.
LEADMALE:No, I'm the receptionist.
LEADMALE:- What's your name? - Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that your first name or your last name? Yes, it is.
LEADFEMALE:- I see.
LEADFEMALE:- No, I-C spells ic.
SUPMALE:- M-O-R-K spells Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, you must be the man who called in and wanted the doctor to shoot the works.
SUPFEMALE:That's me, M-E.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Well, the doctor will be with you in a few minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:See? It worked the same way.
OTHERMALE:Like a charm, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Wouldn't it be funny if the Broncos played the Colts? They'd have to call a foal.
LEADFEMALE:Is this doctor any good? Oh, she certainly is.
OTHERFEMALE:She helped my husband when he had his crow's feet.
SUPFEMALE:Crow's feet.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, those can really tear up the carpet, can't they? Let me guess.
SUPFEMALE:Your husband had crow's feet.
SUPFEMALE:You have frog's legs.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, I'm getting her nose.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, really? You know what I'd say if I were her? What do you wanna do that for? I didn't mean to make fun of you.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you having done? Well, I'm shooting the works.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna have my face tucked, my cheeks pinched and my bags packed.
LEADMALE:Sir, the doctor will see you now.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Good luck.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, everything will be fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Would you like to go in there and have a seat? Oh, a seat? No, thanks, that part's okay.
LEADMALE:Mindy, have you noticed anything strange about your dad? Strange? No, why? Well, he's been acting a little unusual lately.
SUPMALE:Like the other day, he asked me if I thought he would look younger with his fringe permed.
OTHERMALE:- Dad said that? - Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:He passed it off as a joke, but I'm not so sure.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I wouldn't worry about it.
OTHERMALE:He's probably going through a little phase.
SUPMALE:I hope so.
LEADMALE:The other night, we were sitting in front of the fireplace sipping wine.
LEADFEMALE:It was very romantic.
SUPMALE:And he looked me right in the eye and he said: ''Cathy, darling, do you realise when you're 65, I'll be dead?'' That sounds like the middle-aged crazies.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know what's making him act this way.
SUPMALE:I really have never said anything to make him defensive about his age.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, listen, Cathy, you're the best thing that's ever happened to Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe he feels like he doesn't deserve you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mindy, any woman would be lucky to have a man like your father.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe he just needs to hear that a little more often.
SUPFEMALE:But it's so obvious.
LEADMALE:I mean, I even told Mork this morning.
OTHERFEMALE:- Mork? - Yes.
SUPMALE:He came over to borrow a cup of Liquid-Plumr.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, then he asked me, ''What do you think is a perfect ten?'' And I said, Fred.
SUPFEMALE:You know, that's funny, he asked me the same question.
SUPMALE:And I gave him the same answer.
LEADMALE:Well, hi, Lola and Stephanie, what a surprise.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mindy.
LEADMALE:We came over to see Mork.
LEADMALE:Do you have any ice cream you're not using? Well, yeah, there's some over there in the fridge.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:No, Lola, Mork hasn't gotten home yet.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I wanted to see how he turned out.
LEADMALE:Oh, did you know him when he was a little boy? Your friend has a delightful sense of the absurd.
SUPMALE:- This is Cathy.
LEADMALE:- Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Lola, what did you mean by how Mork turned out? He left the daycare centre early today to go to a plastic surgeon.
LEADMALE:- A plastic surgeon? - What for? I heard him say he was going to shoot the works.
LEADMALE:Shoot the works? Did he happen to mention what doctor he was gonna go see? Sure, he called from the centre.
SUPMALE:- It was Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Dubin.
LEADMALE:- Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Dubin.
SUPFEMALE:Great, thanks a lot, Lola.
LEADMALE:You've been a big help.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just look it up in the phone book.
SUPFEMALE:I hope Mork doesn't get too many things changed.
LEADFEMALE:He had such a charming Chaplinesque quality.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Stephanie.
OTHERFEMALE:And you know you're out of whipped cream again.
OTHERMALE:I hope we're not too late.
LEADMALE:Fred? Dad.
LEADFEMALE:How's my little girl? Did you bring him here? Him? Who him? - Mork.
LEADMALE:- No.
OTHERMALE:Nice talking to you.
SUPMALE:Fred, who did you bring here? Just little old me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what would you be doing at a plastic surgeon's? What would you be doing at a plastic surgeon's? Well, we came here looking for Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:What would Mork be doing at a plastic surgeon? He doesn't have bags under his eyes.
LEADMALE:Oh, Fred, what are you talking about? May I help you? No.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I like the way I look.
LEADFEMALE:A friend of mine came here named Mork? Yes, Mork, I remember him.
SUPFEMALE:He's the guy that asked for some changes that would make Mr.
SUPMALE:Potato Head proud.
SUPMALE:What did he have done? Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Patient information is confidential.
LEADMALE:She said that Mork was here, but he left.
LEADFEMALE:Where would Mork get the idea that he needed plastic surgery? Got me.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess he got the idea from me.
LEADMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Well, we'd better get home.
OTHERFEMALE:Lord knows what he's had done.
SUPMALE:I swear I didn't know anything about it.
LEADFEMALE:Cancel my appointment, I'll be back later.
LEADFEMALE:Anything you say, handsome.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork, are you there? - No, I'm here, you're there.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing in the armoire? I'm just waiting for you to come home, so I can make a grand entrance.
LEADFEMALE:Why haven't I gotten used to moments like these? Hi, hon.
SUPFEMALE:How's my little girl? Cathy, you look great.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, hon.
LEADFEMALE:You look great too.
LEADMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:You know, he does look vaguely familiar.
OTHERMALE:You know, he does look vaguely familiar.
SUPFEMALE:Now, cut that out.
LEADFEMALE:Now, cut that out.
LEADFEMALE:Mork.
SUPMALE:You see, it's the latest thing from the Yves St.
LEADFEMALE:La Fred.
LEADFEMALE:Notice the new wraparound hairline that any Hare Krishna would envy.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, what are you doing? Well, when I'm not dropping in on my perky daughter and her madcap roommate, I'm home with my lovely wife, Cathy, and saying, ''How's my love kitten?'' - Mork.
SUPMALE:- Mork.
LEADFEMALE:I feel like I'm listening to bald stereo.
LEADMALE:We thought you'd done something ridiculous at the plastic surgeon.
LEADFEMALE:No, the doctor laughed me out of the office, so I had to do something ridiculous on my own.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Where did you get that thing? Pierre Trudeau.
LEADMALE:Margaret said it was one of his throwaways.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mind, didn't fool you? Well, you had me going for a minute, but the latex stretch marks gave you away.
LEADFEMALE:That's very cute, Mork, but why are you me? Well, you always said that you have to look better for those you care about.
LEADMALE:And both Cathy and Mindy said that you were a ten.
SUPFEMALE:And I thought, well, with all my other qualities, I might be an 1 1 .
LEADMALE:Oh, I guess I've done wrong, haven't I? No, Mork.
SUPMALE:We just like you better the way you were.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I see.
SUPFEMALE:I've made another mistake.
LEADFEMALE:I've bitten the big watata again.
LEADFEMALE:That's all right.
LEADFEMALE:If I only had a broom, I could leave here like Emmett Kelly.
LEADFEMALE:It's all right.
LEADMALE:Pathetic figure departs.
SUPMALE:Excuse me while I go help my pathetic friend.
LEADMALE:You said I was a ten? With a capital T.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Now, look, I know what you're thinking.
OTHERMALE:That a wife has a right to know when her husband is gonna rotate his parts.
SUPMALE:But look, you're so pretty, and you're Well, all right, I'll say it.
LEADMALE:You're so young.
OTHERMALE:I mean, you don't even have a wrinkle.
LEADMALE:You don't even pucker when you soak.
LEADFEMALE:Are you finished, old-timer? - Yes.
LEADFEMALE:- Sit down, Fred.
SUPFEMALE:If you wanna have plastic surgery, that's fine.
LEADMALE:- It is? - Sure.
LEADMALE:If you're doing it for you.
LEADMALE:But if you're doing it to look better for me, then you're making a big mistake.
LEADFEMALE:But I wanna feel like I belong with you.
LEADFEMALE:Fred, you are the most beautiful man in the world.
SUPMALE:You're kind, you're loving, you're sensitive, and it's written all over your face.
LEADFEMALE:Don't erase a line.
LEADMALE:That's the nicest thing you ever said to me.
LEADFEMALE:Something's wrong, Mind, they're not even talking.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess we'd better be going.
OTHERMALE:Yes, it's getting late, it's almost 7:30.
LEADMALE:Seven-thirty, Mind.
SUPMALE:Listen, I just want you to know that I've taken another look at this face.
LEADFEMALE:And you know something? It ain't so bad after all.
LEADMALE:And, Mork, next time you do me, I use my left hand when I say: ''How's my little girl?'' How's my little girl? - Goodbye, kids.
SUPFEMALE:- Yeah, we two tens are going home.
SUPMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:- Cute couple, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, aren't they? Well, it's almost 7:30, huh? You know what that means, don't you? No, do you? Brady Bunch reruns.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Your Beer-Belliness.
LEADFEMALE:Roll out the Orson Thank you, Judy and Cissy, for that lovely melody.
LEADMALE:lt is customary, Mork, to respect one's superiors.
LEADFEMALE:Hear that, Beeb? No gratitude from His Fatitude.
SUPMALE:- Give a little latitude and-- - Your report, Mork.
SUPMALE:This week, sir, I learned that Earthlings can change their appearance.
LEADMALE:They wear shoes to make them taller, girdles to make them thinner, wigs to make them hairier.
LEADFEMALE:Then they say, ''Darling, why can't you accept me for what I am?'' - Bizarre.
LEADMALE:- Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:And their bizarres are padded also.
LEADFEMALE:Wait till you hear this, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Some Earthlings go to doctors to have bumps removed from their noses, and you won't believe where they put them.
LEADFEMALE:Do these changes make humans look better, Mork? I don't know about that, but they must make them feel better.
OTHERMALE:But I think some of these changes are unnecessary.
LEADFEMALE:You see, most Earthlings change themselves because they don't think they look good to others when the real problem is they don't look good enough to themselves.
LEADFEMALE:Pity, huh? On that, sir, good night, and until next week.
SUPMALE:Na-no, na-no.
