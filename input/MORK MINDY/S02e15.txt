LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't got enough to make it to the couch.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I do, but I haven't got enough to get back.

SUPMALE:Yesterday's game.
OTHERMALE:I got the guy coming tomorrow to de-Schlitz it.
OTHERFEMALE:You got any beer? No, I guess you'll just have to throw some wine.
LEADMALE:Remo, I've got a problem.
LEADMALE:I wanna travel.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Go! Go! Go! That's easy for you to say, but how do you do it? How do you do it without airfare? Run, you meatball, run! I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, China's a long way.
SUPMALE:If the distance doesn't get you, the tariffs will.
SUPMALE:The sharks Ah, timeout.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Come on, come on, come on! All right, what I was trying to ask was how can you work and travel at the same time? Do what I did.
OTHERMALE:Join the Air Force.

LEADFEMALE:" No.
LEADMALE:I've got it! "May the Air Force be with you.
LEADFEMALE:" Eeh-h-h-h.
SUPFEMALE:Ugh.
SUPMALE:I've got to come up with a recruiting slogan.
SUPMALE:What was your old one? The brass just didn't like my old one.
SUPFEMALE:What was it? "The Air Force isn't so bad.
SUPMALE:" Well, you convinced me.

SUPFEMALE:You sound like real officer material.
LEADFEMALE:No, I don't want an office.
LEADMALE:I just want an application form.
OTHERMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:I'm not a recruiter.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a lieutenant in public relations.
SUPFEMALE:Are they fun? Oodles.
LEADMALE:This is an Air Force base.
LEADMALE:The recruiting office is in downtown Boulder.
LEADMALE:Just bring them your birth certificate, driver's license and your social security card.
SUPMALE:Well, the only card I got was from a guy downtown that said, "Live Lady Mud Wrestling.
LEADFEMALE:Call Lumpy.
LEADMALE:" Well, You gotta have those things, or they're not gonna let you in.
LEADMALE:( sighs ): Won't they let me in just on my personality? I can do an audition piece for them.
SUPMALE:This is Blanche Dubois from A Streetcar Named Desire as Tonto.
LEADMALE:( with high voice ): I've always been accustomed to the kindness of rangers.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid not.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:You gotta let me in.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna travel.
OTHERMALE:I wanna join your club.
LEADMALE:Please.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
OTHERMALE:Rules are rules.
SUPFEMALE:I know that.
OTHERFEMALE:If you're gonna be snooty, you won't get any business.
SUPMALE:Look, this is my lunch hour.
SUPMALE:Why don't you take a couple of these pamphlets and read up on the Air Force? But I'm telling you right now, they're not gonna let you in unless you have the right papers.
LEADFEMALE:Even if I'm a hard worker? I'm also a nice guy.
LEADMALE:That's it! The Air Force needs a few nice guys.
LEADMALE:( sighs ) All I have to do is convince them that I'd be a lot of fun on one of their Air Force trips.
LEADFEMALE:Up in the air Junior bird Eh.

SUPMALE:You guys want some coffee? You call that brown stuff coffee? You know, that green stuff we had for lunch today was worse than the green stuff we had last week.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's because last week it was Jell-O.
LEADFEMALE:Today it's meatloaf.
LEADMALE:Well, at least we won't have to worry about mess hall tonight.
OTHERMALE:I wonder where they're sending us.
LEADMALE:Everything's so hush-hush.
LEADMALE:Wherever it is, let's hope it's close to a McDonalds.
SUPFEMALE:Give me five.
LEADMALE:Hi, there, jet-setters.
LEADFEMALE:Attention! You're right.
SUPFEMALE:No, there's too much tension as there is already.
LEADFEMALE:Now, come on, let's relax, let's relax.
SUPMALE:Send your shoulders down.
OTHERMALE:Here we go.
SUPMALE:First of all, do a little of these.
LEADMALE:Go, "Whoa.
OTHERMALE:" Now let the shoulders go.
LEADFEMALE:Let 'em go, let 'em go.
LEADFEMALE:Relax.
OTHERMALE:Bad energy out! Bad energy out! There.
LEADFEMALE:Now that we're relaxed, what's happening? We're being mobilized, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, punctual me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm right on time.
LEADMALE:Do you know where we're going, sir? I give up.
OTHERMALE:Where? I think he's been at peace too long.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm tired of being kept in the dark.
OTHERFEMALE:They never tell you anything.
LEADMALE:I hate that.
LEADMALE:You know what I hate? I hate it when you always get that little piece of popcorn You eat it, and it gets way in the back You eat it and all of a sudden, your teeth stick together, and you go "Hi, how are you?" It gets way back there and it's kind of like, uh, fur.
SUPMALE:( imitates gagging ) Excuse me, sir, if you don't mind my saying, may I suggest a little R and R? Well, if you insist.
LEADMALE:( chortles ): Ar-ar-ar-ar.
SUPFEMALE:Attention! No, no, no.
OTHERMALE:Relaxation.
LEADFEMALE:Once again, too much tension.
LEADMALE:( with Indian accent ): Try a little yoga for the mantra.
SUPFEMALE:When you get the mantra Lieutenant.
SUPFEMALE:The man said, "ten-hut!" Okay! I can't hear you! Okay.
SUPMALE:What's this, your idea of a little joke? No, my idea of a joke is this: This chicken walks into a bar, heh What's your name? Mork from Ork.
LEADMALE:Wipe that smile off your face.
LEADFEMALE:I suggest, Lieutenant Fromork, that you start acting more in keeping with the seriousness of this assignment.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, men.
SUPFEMALE:The truck will be here in ten minutes.
LEADMALE:Then you're all going on a little trip.
SUPFEMALE:Where to, sir? You'll find out soon enough.
OTHERFEMALE:But I can tell you this much: For some of us here tonight, it's gonna be full of hardship, sacrifice, and great personal danger.
SUPFEMALE:Not me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna sign up for tennis, golf, and scuba.
SUPFEMALE:( suspenseful theme playing ) ( tranquil theme playing ) La-da-da-da rule We'll take it La-da-da-da chance We'll break it We're gonna make Our dreams come true Doin' it our way Whoo-ooh ( groans ) Hi, Mork, is that you? Let me check.
LEADFEMALE:Yep.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm really enjoying this day off.
SUPFEMALE:I'm finally getting a chance to do all those things I never have time to do.
LEADFEMALE:You mean, like cleaning the pool, waxing the dog, or washing the limo? Uh, we can't afford a pool, a limo, or a dog.
OTHERMALE:See how inflation's such a labor-saving device? Oh, Min, Min, Min, you know Oh, no, Min! Attack of the Jolson people! No, Mindy! ( as Al Jolson ): Oh, Minny! Oh, Minny, Minny, Minny! ( mumbling indistinctly ) Mork, don't touch me.
LEADFEMALE:It's just a facial, to make me look better.
LEADFEMALE:Bad news, Min.
LEADMALE:I-I think it's kind of retroactive.
SUPMALE:Well, it's supposed to make me look great.
LEADMALE:I don't want you looking great, I like you looking back the old self.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:So where have you been? I went to join that travel club Remo told me about.
LEADFEMALE:What travel club? USAF.
OTHERMALE:USAF? Yeah, you know.
OTHERFEMALE:U period, S period, A period, F period.
LEADMALE:USAF.
SUPMALE:You joined the United States Air Force? Lieutenant Fromork here.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my Oh, not officially.
SUPMALE:But I just tagged along on one of their trips.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe this, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean, you tagged along on a trips? Well, I'm not supposed to tell you.
LEADMALE:It was all done on the Q-tip.
SUPMALE:Mork, it's against the law to pose as a member of the military.
SUPFEMALE:You go to jail for that.
LEADFEMALE:Now, where did you go? They didn't want us to tell.
LEADFEMALE:I can't blame them for trying.
LEADFEMALE:Because it was a crummy place to vacation.
SUPFEMALE:Will you just tell me where you went? Oh, to some nuclear dump about 30 miles out of town, as the Geiger counts.
SUPMALE:Why would you go there? They said it was an accident.
LEADFEMALE:But when we got there, it was kind of boring.
SUPMALE:I did see some guys playing a game.
LEADFEMALE:There were these 40 guys in lead suits trying to push this big cracked barrel with long poles.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think anybody won, but when they finally got into this big, lead room, ( chuckling ): They all ran outside like they had hornets in their pants.
SUPMALE:A nuclear accident? Yeah, something like that.
SUPFEMALE:Take care.
LEADMALE:Mork? ( suspenseful theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Min, it was no big deal, really.
LEADMALE:I just stood there for a couple of hours, and some people relieved me from my guard duty.
LEADFEMALE:Then I came home.
LEADMALE:How was your day? I don't know how you can be so casual about this, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You must have misunderstood what was going on.
SUPMALE:There are so many safeguards against radiation leaks.
LEADMALE:Min, I mean, it's no big deal.
LEADMALE:On Ork, whenever we have a nuclear accident, we just use Nuke-Away.
OTHERFEMALE:Nuke-Away? Well, yeah, it comes in pine scent or that exciting new fragrance, fusion.
SUPMALE:I mean, it takes the worry out of being radioactive.
OTHERMALE:Mork, we don't have anything like Nuke-Away here on Earth.
SUPMALE:Well, then how do you get rid of telltale nuclear waste? We don't.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Min, you can't tell me people with nuclear power don't have any way of disposing of the waste.
SUPMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:I mean, next thing you'll tell me is you're gonna put it in cans, right? Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:We do.
LEADFEMALE:You do.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, yeah.
SUPMALE:You do? Whoa! We gotta get out of her, Min! Come on.
SUPFEMALE:We gotta take a quick hike.
LEADFEMALE:We'll take the next egg out.
SUPMALE:Don't pack.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get you clothes at Frederick's of Venus.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, let's go.
LEADMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:We can't just leave.
OTHERMALE:If what you say is true, there are thousands of people that can be in danger.
LEADMALE:I mean, we gotta tell somebody.
LEADFEMALE:As we fly, we'll drop pamphlets saying, "Trespassers beware or you'll go bald.
LEADFEMALE:" Now, let's go.
LEADMALE:Mork.
SUPMALE:I gotta notify the authorities.
LEADFEMALE:There's one minor hang-up with that, Min.
LEADMALE:What? Well, the Air Force is the authorities.
LEADFEMALE:See, it's kind of like Catch-44.
SUPFEMALE:It's like Catch-22 except twice as bad.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we gotta tell somebody.
LEADMALE:I mean.
LEADFEMALE:The people have a right to know things like this.
LEADMALE:They just can't get away with covering this thing up.
OTHERMALE:Who's covering it up? Nixon's been gone for a long time.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:Probably the company that owns the dump.
LEADMALE:Why would they want to cover it up? Well, they usually say they don't want people to panic.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I see.
LEADFEMALE:"What they don't know won't hurt them, until it does.
LEADMALE:" Yeah.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:We'll go to the newspapers.
LEADFEMALE:Except they'd never believe us.
LEADFEMALE:You're a journalism student.
SUPFEMALE:What would you do? A good investigative reporter would get all the hard facts.
SUPFEMALE:Well, can't we just get some soft facts and let 'em petrify? I know what we'll do, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna go back to that dump and we're gonna get evidence.
SUPFEMALE:We'll take this tape recorder and we're gonna talk to the men.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:No chance, Lance.
LEADFEMALE:I can go in as an Air Force lieutenant and come out as a radioactive reserve.
LEADFEMALE:It has to be reasonably safe or they wouldn't let people in.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but maybe we're just laboratory rats in uniform.
LEADMALE:Well, I don't know, Mork, but somebody's gotta do something.
OTHERFEMALE:Goodbye, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You know, sometimes we have to think of others rather than just ourselves.
LEADMALE:( as Mindy ): Sometimes you have to think of others All right, let's see.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:Mankind.
SUPMALE:Let's weigh the action.
SUPFEMALE:Mank-i-i-ind.
LEADFEMALE:I gotta get my scales checked.
SUPMALE:Min! Mind, I'm coming! Mind, I'm coming! Mind! All right, wherever you glow, I'll glow.
LEADMALE:( suspenseful theme playing ) ( door opening ) Mork, how did you get this uniform? Well, sometimes rank has privileges, but I think the supply sergeant was a little suspicious when I asked for a size seven petite.
LEADMALE:Hey, it's Lieutenant Fromork.
LEADFEMALE:Good to see you, sir.
LEADMALE:We weren't expecting to be relieved for another hour.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, who's the guy? Oh, it's just another dog face, flyboy, junior birdman.
LEADFEMALE:( with low voice ): Uh, name's, uh, Airman McConnell, but you guys can call me Howard.
LEADMALE:McConnell, what's wrong with your voice? Eh, football injury.
SUPMALE:Know anything more about what we're not supposed to know? Just what we knew before.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, really? I kind of forgot.
LEADMALE:I had a football injury too.
LEADFEMALE:Could you kind of tell me again, word by word? Ah, you don't wanna hear about that again.
LEADMALE:Hey, Let me tell you about Angela, huh? If they hadn't called this emergency, I'd be with her right now.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Who's Angela? Here she is being crowned Miss Rocky Mountains.
SUPFEMALE:( whistles ) Whoa.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ): I can see why.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, I like 'em curvy.
LEADFEMALE:Say, how do you like 'em, Howard? Oh, I like 'em intelligent.
SUPMALE:Just how serious was that injury? Don't worry about McConnell.
SUPMALE:He's got everything that a woman wants.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Listen, we're gonna take our leave.
OTHERMALE:We'll see you later, all right? See you guys, huh? Hey, way to go, way to go.
SUPMALE:( with normal voice ): What is this? It's man stuff.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll let it go this time, but just remember I am a woman.
SUPMALE:Is my mustache on straight? Is it supposed to go up and down? No! Then it's on right.
LEADMALE:Mind, at least we passed the first test.
LEADMALE:They believed that you were a man.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:See, I told you the mustache would work better than steroids.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what do we do now? Well, we wait until somebody who knows something comes in, and then we get them to answer some questions into the tape recorder.
SUPMALE:Do you have it in a safe place? It's in my pocket.
LEADMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:Do you think we're in any danger here? I don't know, but if my knees knock any louder, I'm gonna look inside my pants and see who's there.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet you that's where they're keeping the leaking container.
SUPMALE:( door opening ) The recorder.
OTHERFEMALE:Right in my hip pocket.
OTHERFEMALE:Why did you put it back there? Shh! Ten-hut! At ease, men, I'm just checking to make sure the area's secure.
LEADFEMALE:( with low voice ): How's the situation look, sir? What's your name? Airman McConnell, sir.
SUPMALE:Are you new? About 23 years old, sir.
SUPMALE:Ar-ar! Why don't any of our men defect? Exactly how bad was the accident, sir? Nothing to worry about.
OTHERMALE:By the way, was your voice normal when you came here? Sir, I think we have a right to know why the Air Force was called in, don't we, sir? We were the closest military unit that was able to respond.
LEADMALE:Respond to what, sir? We were ordered in here to protect the public.
LEADMALE:You see, we store a lot of radioactive waste here.
LEADFEMALE:Now, most of these containers, well, they're just perfectly safe.
LEADFEMALE:However, some of them, well you You might as well keep 'em in Tupperware.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? I'm right behind you, sir, all the way.
LEADMALE:Just how bad was the accident, sir? Well, the problem is, atomic wastes have a half-life of 240,000 years.
LEADFEMALE:Now, fortunately, the spill was confined to a relatively small area.
OTHERFEMALE:We're keeping the canister in question in that lead-filled room.
SUPFEMALE:It doesn't look like anybody's health's gonna be in jeopardy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, when will we know for sure, sir? Does this kind of thing happen often, sir? Old disco injury, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I'll tell, but this has got to be kept in the strictest confidence.
OTHERMALE:I'm all ears, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) Remo, did you read about this radiation spill? It was only 30 miles from here.
LEADMALE:Who cares? I've got real problems.
SUPMALE:Re Oh, goodness, you are right.
LEADFEMALE:That apron just doesn't go with that tie.
SUPMALE:Why don't you just splash a little more gravy on the tie? Hey, I got a $30 parking ticket I gotta beat.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I get it.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna plead insanity.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm gonna try and impress the judge with what a nice guy I am.
LEADFEMALE:And I brought him one of my special sandwiches.
LEADMALE:Don't do it, Remo.
SUPMALE:He'll give you the chair.
LEADFEMALE:Very funny.
SUPMALE:Hi, there, Big Apple-ites.
SUPMALE:Mork, Mindy, did you guys see this incredible story? No, what is it? ( clears throat ): There was an accident at the nuclear dump, and the company somehow forgot to report it.
SUPFEMALE:How'd they find out about it? Someone sneaked in with a tape recorder and got proof.
LEADFEMALE:The newspaper got an anonymous tip.
LEADFEMALE:Who from? They don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Anyhow, because of the exposÃ©, the government has agreed to put all that waste in new containers.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder why they wouldn't take credit.
OTHERMALE:They'd be heroes.
LEADMALE:Well, there's an old saying.
LEADMALE:( as gangster ): Those who uncover a coverup might get covered up themselves.
LEADFEMALE:Or maybe the people that did it feel that the public's right to know is more important than being famous.
LEADFEMALE:I bet there are a lot of people would like to meet and thank the people who got that story.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, shucks, we'd prob They'd probably say it were nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you two want some lunch? Yeah, what'll What'll you have, Mork? Why don't you make us a couple of hero sandwiches.
OTHERMALE:Big ones.
LEADMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( mysterious theme playing ) Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:ORSON: Hello, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:What's new? Well, no, no, sir, it's what's nuke.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Mork, what's nuke? Well, it's short for nuclear.
LEADFEMALE:You see, this week, sir, I-I had a job guarding a leak at a nuclear dumping site.
LEADFEMALE:Guarding it from whom, Mork? Well, the people who live near the dump.
LEADFEMALE:It was very hush-hush.
LEADMALE:Why was that? Well, governments on Earth like to play a game.
SUPFEMALE:It's called "I've Got a Secret.
SUPFEMALE:" But when it comes time to tell the truth, it's "Let's Make a Deal.
LEADFEMALE:" Sounds like they don't want to burden the public with too much information.
SUPFEMALE:But, Orson, how can you prepare for the rain if you don't know what the weather forecast is? See, I believe people have the right to know everything that might affect their well-being.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe there's a good reason, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Isn't there an Earth saying that "ignorance is bliss"? Not in this case, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:You see, it's a good thing to conserve energy, but it's a bad thing to keep people in the dark.
LEADMALE:I have some specific information I'd like to relate Oh.
SUPMALE:Until next week, nanu, nanu.
