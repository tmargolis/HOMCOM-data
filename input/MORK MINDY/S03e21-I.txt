LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it.
OTHERMALE:What a morning to be late.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'd like to get my hands on the guy who invented the snooze alarm.
LEADMALE:Morning, morning Oh, Mind, let me help you with those suckers.
LEADMALE:Come on now, hon.
SUPMALE:That's all right.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that lovely? - Here we are.
SUPMALE:- Thanks, Mork.
LEADMALE:But I was trying to put the boot on.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I guess we start off the day on the wrong foot, huh? Well, Mind, I'm really famished.
LEADFEMALE:I feel like Gandhi at a McDonald's.
LEADMALE:Come on now.
LEADFEMALE:I feel I can eat an aardvark's tongue.
LEADFEMALE:Come on now, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Sorry, Mork, but I'm production coordinator on a new show today and I've gotta be at the studio in ten minutes.
OTHERFEMALE:You could fix me a minute steak.
LEADMALE:That'll give you nine minutes to spare.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna have to fix your own breakfast today.
SUPMALE:And maybe dinner too.
SUPFEMALE:It might be another late night.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, red light, whoa.
SUPMALE:Stop, kemosabe.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, you want moi to cook? Yeah, you're a big Orkan now.
SUPMALE:I think you can handle yourself in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:And maybe cleaning up around here too.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, Mind, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:I draw the line right there.
LEADMALE:I will not cook, clean or do windows.
LEADFEMALE:I am man.
SUPFEMALE:Watch me sit.
LEADFEMALE:Where'd you get that idea? Robert Petrie, Jim Anderson and Archie Bunker.
SUPFEMALE:- Who? - Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Television.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Mork, that's a lot of bunk.
LEADFEMALE:TV isn't real life.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, are you kidding? Then Ricky really doesn't love Lucy? Look, Mork, since I've been working, I just don't have enough time to do all the things around the house.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna need your help.
LEADMALE:Enlightened Mork to the rescue.
LEADFEMALE:But, please, don't make me cook, because I'll get thinner than Ronald Reagan's environmental budget.
SUPMALE:Look, you travelled I think that you can pour yourself a bowl of cereal.
OTHERMALE:Listen, I gotta run.
SUPMALE:- Well-- - I'll see you later.
LEADMALE:Don't wait up.
OTHERFEMALE:It might be another late night.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:Big kiss, Mindy-- She used to have time for a big kiss.
LEADFEMALE:Now she hasn't even got time to pucker.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, I knew you'd come-- Is the lady of the house at home? Exidor.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, is that you? Hey, what are we doing just standing here talking? Come on in.
OTHERMALE:My, my, my.
SUPMALE:Isn't this a delightful home? Don't rush me, I'll get to the sales pitch.
OTHERMALE:Good morning, sir or madam.
LEADFEMALE:We represent the Exidor-to-Door Company.
LEADFEMALE:Exclusive distributors of these thingamajigs.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Exidor, but I already have a thingamajig.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right.
LEADMALE:I'll tell him what it does.
LEADMALE:And why? Because this miracle of modern technology can do everything a maid can do, except steal the silverware.
LEADMALE:And next week, we're putting out an attachment for that.
LEADMALE:- Amazing.
LEADFEMALE:- Yes.
OTHERMALE:The revolutionary new Maid-O-Matic.
LEADMALE:Exidor, does this really make housework easier? You don't want it? I know, I know.
LEADMALE:Go to the hard sell.
LEADMALE:You buy this gizmo, or you'll never see your wife and kids again.
SUPMALE:- I'm not married.
SUPFEMALE:- We have an attachment for that too.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I should buy this.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy says I should be helping her - with the cooking and cleaning.
LEADMALE:- What? Did you hear that, boys? The skirt's pushing him around.
LEADFEMALE:- No, she isn't.
LEADFEMALE:- Is.
SUPMALE:- Isn't.
LEADFEMALE:- Is.
LEADMALE:The vote is 1 2 to 1 against you.
OTHERMALE:Well, I guess she is.
SUPMALE:But all I wanted to do was make housework easier.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You whimpering washrag.
LEADMALE:Pull yourself together.
LEADMALE:Who wears the pants in this house? You or the tomato? Well, she does.
LEADMALE:But, well, this man's had enough, though.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not gonna let her push me around, because I'm gonna be the best little wifey Mindy ever had.
SUPFEMALE:But I do draw the line at motherhood.
LEADMALE:Boy, housework is a snap.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know what Erma Bombeck's kvetching about all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, here we go.
LEADMALE:Oh, look, brown and black, Mindy's favourite colours.
SUPMALE:She won't mind.
SUPMALE:It could keep the bugs away.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see.
SUPFEMALE:What we do now? Well, I think I'll make a little salad for my breadwinner.
OTHERMALE:There we are.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see, let's see.
OTHERMALE:Instructions.
LEADFEMALE:''Put vegetables inside.
LEADFEMALE:'' All right, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see.
SUPMALE:''Turn on.
LEADFEMALE:'' Wait a minute! Wait! Vesuvius.
SUPFEMALE:Abandon-- Attention boys, abandon ship, abandon ship.
LEADMALE:Save yourself.
LEADMALE:What is going on? Jiminy crickets.
LEADFEMALE:What in the world is going on here, Mork? What are you trying to do, qualify for a federal disaster loan? Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I was just trying to help, and-- It looked easy at the time I was doing it.
LEADFEMALE:Then all of a suddenlike Krypton.
LEADMALE:Well, what did you expect? Housework isn't easy.
LEADMALE:It's miserable, backbreaking, repetitive, unrewarding, non-paying labour.
OTHERMALE:And look what it's done to my hands.
SUPFEMALE:That's horrible.
SUPMALE:They look like lobsters at a tanning salon.
SUPMALE:Quick, call Madge.
LEADMALE:- Mindy made it always look so easy.
LEADMALE:- Well, it isn't.
LEADMALE:And my wife didn't like it either.
LEADMALE:She wanted to get a job, but I laid down the law.
LEADFEMALE:I told her, her job was to cook the meals and take care of the house.
OTHERMALE:After that, we never had another problem.
SUPFEMALE:- Everything was dokey-okey, right? - Wrong.
OTHERMALE:She left me.
SUPFEMALE:You know, and I still miss the static on the TV when she'd vacuum under my feet.
LEADMALE:I don't want Mindy to leave me.
LEADFEMALE:You'd better call her and find out how to run this place before it's too late.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do that right away.
SUPFEMALE:Five, four, three, two, cue music.

LEADMALE:No, Mindy, but I might suggest that this Mork come see me at the clinic.
OTHERFEMALE:What is it now, Mork? Oh, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Sternhagen.
LEADMALE:Yes, I'll be right in to see you.
OTHERMALE:I knew it was too good to last.

LEADFEMALE:Hot potato, hot pota-- Nothing says loving like something from the oven.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, I almost lost my job today.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hon, I know work was such a hard, hard thing today.
SUPMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you just sit down now and relax? You just sit down and rest those little tired bones and tootsies.
SUPMALE:- No problem, there.
LEADMALE:- Mork, I don't-- Whoa, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:There's your little pipe.
OTHERMALE:Here's the sports page.
LEADFEMALE:I cut a few recipes out.
OTHERFEMALE:I hope you don't mind.
OTHERFEMALE:And we've got your little slippers here.
LEADFEMALE:Little teddies on them.
LEADFEMALE:Put those on.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know what a hard day it's been for me.
SUPFEMALE:Trying to put a waxy, yellow build-up on that floor.
LEADMALE:Mork, I don't wanna talk about the floor.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna talk about what happened at work today.
LEADMALE:Work, work, work.
SUPFEMALE:That's all you type-A personalities ever wanna talk about.
LEADFEMALE:You don't even think about me.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing to worry about for me.
OTHERFEMALE:You almost got me fired today.
LEADFEMALE:You embarrassed me on the air, and-- And I just want you to promise that it will not happen again.
LEADMALE:So this is the thanks I get for slaving over a hot stove? And working my fingers to the bone? And wasting the best bleams of my life? Oh, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Mork, calm down.
SUPFEMALE:No, you calm down! Here I am in this house cooped up all day, vicariously living through your exploits.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Look, forget-- Forget I ever mentioned anything about it.
SUPFEMALE:Look, we'll sit down, we'll have a nice little dinner, just the two of us.
LEADMALE:You want your dinner, you eat out.
LEADMALE:Mork, come on, you're overreacting.
SUPMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Don't touch me.
LEADFEMALE:I have a headache.
SUPMALE:And always remember, Carol, that one day, your children will be parents too.
LEADFEMALE:And that's when they'll get theirs.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye now.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that wraps up another session.
LEADMALE:So until next time, this is Dr.
LEADMALE:Joni Lincoln hoping that all your problems are little ones.
LEADMALE:Are we still on the air, Mindy? Oh, no, it's over.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, wrap.
LEADFEMALE:Let's wrap.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Dr.
SUPMALE:Lincoln.
LEADMALE:I really am.
LEADMALE:I don't know where my mind has been lately.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mindy, are you all right? You've been forgetting cues, and whenever the phone rings, you cringe.
LEADMALE:I know I'm not supposed to bring my problems to work with me, but it's the guy I live with.
SUPFEMALE:Mork? Well, he's just not adjusting very well to my working.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I don't mean to be laying this all on you.
OTHERMALE:Oh, please, everybody does.
LEADMALE:It's part of the job.
SUPFEMALE:Lay it on me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's just that the two of us Well, I don't know, everything got turned around somehow.
LEADMALE:- And it was pretty weird to begin with.
SUPMALE:- I see.
SUPMALE:Well, Mindy, in any household, when a woman begins a career, there are always gonna be some adjustments.
SUPFEMALE:I know, I went through it with my family.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but Mork has over-adjusted.
SUPMALE:In one day, he went from being Ozzie to Harriet.
OTHERFEMALE:Could be an identity problem.
LEADMALE:Well, Mork shares in the housework, but I wanna help with those responsibilities too.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want him waiting on me hand and foot.
LEADMALE:How long have you been living together? About three years.
SUPMALE:Is your physical relationship compatible? Well, I-- I guess that-- That all depends on what you call ''compatible.
LEADFEMALE:'' I mean, we kiss and, you know-- But we don't You know.
OTHERFEMALE:But-- But we're compatible.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, Mindy, in any relationship, it takes more than one person to make a problem, and we can talk about a number of ways to help improve things.
LEADMALE:But right now, I'd rather you didn't say a word.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Because I think we're still on the air.
LEADMALE:I'll be right in, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Sternhagen.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mork.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's you.
SUPMALE:How nice.
LEADMALE:Did you happen to see the show today? No, I had an exhausting afternoon at the day-care.
LEADMALE:We had an artistic problem.
SUPFEMALE:There was crayon lodged in Mrs.
LEADMALE:Fowler's ear.
SUPMALE:Well, listen.
LEADMALE:Today I had a long conversation with Dr.
LEADMALE:Lincoln about our problems.
LEADFEMALE:Problems? We have no problems.
LEADMALE:We're as happy as two moths on a porch light, you know: - Oh, Mork, no, we're not.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, yes, we are.
LEADMALE:- And I'm part of the problem.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Mind, you know-- Oh, Mind, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:You don't know what it's like to carry this all alone.
LEADMALE:I thought I was an anchor around your neck.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I was a hangnail on the finger of ambition.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, how can we save the shambles of this relationship? Dr.
OTHERFEMALE:Lincoln suggested some ways that would help us to relate better.
LEADMALE:- They're really more like games.
LEADMALE:- Games? Why didn't you say so? I'll be shirts and you be skins.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:They're not those kind of games.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, actually, they're more like exercises in trust.
SUPMALE:- Let's start with a simple one.
LEADMALE:- All right.
LEADFEMALE:- All right, you stand over here.
SUPMALE:- Okay.
SUPFEMALE:- Now, just stand straight.
OTHERMALE:- Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I want you to fall, and I'll catch you.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds reasonable.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Right, I'll go along with this, Mind, but if it doesn't work, I'm walking.
SUPMALE:No, that's what it's about.
SUPMALE:You've gotta trust me.
LEADMALE:- All right.
LEADMALE:- I promise I'll catch you.
LEADFEMALE:- You promise? - I promise.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Custer.
OTHERMALE:Nice catch, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Mork, you were supposed to fall backwards.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna get the hang of it now, Mind.
LEADMALE:- Mind, something's not right here.
SUPFEMALE:- Okay.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:While you're still in one piece, let's try something else that might help us understand each other.
SUPFEMALE:It's called role reversal.
OTHERMALE:It's where I play you and you play me, and then we act out a scene from our normal daily life.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you mean, I'll be Mindy and you'll be Mork? - There are laws against that, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:- No, no.
LEADMALE:- I think it could only help.
SUPFEMALE:- Well, all right.
SUPFEMALE:Well, give me till tomorrow morning to shave my legs.
LEADMALE:I have to pluck my eyebrows and buy some things.
LEADMALE:I'll be back.
LEADFEMALE:- Morning, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- Morning, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, gosh and golly.
SUPFEMALE:Late again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind.
LEADMALE:Will you fix me breakfast? Will you, huh? Will you? I'm so hungry I could eat Bebo.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I haven't got time right now.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm too busy being a butch career girl.
LEADMALE:Hey, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:That's hitting below the belt.
SUPFEMALE:And stop it, you're gonna stretch out my boots.
LEADMALE:These are your boots? I really had to stuff socks in the front.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, you're so talented and handsome, and you have such great taste in clothes.
OTHERMALE:Hey, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:I never said that.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it would be nice if you did once in a while.
LEADMALE:Mork, Mork.
SUPMALE:Where are my car keys? Did you bury them again? Well, I locked them in the jeep so they wouldn't get lost.
SUPFEMALE:Did I do good? Did I? Did I, huh? Do I get gold star? Absolutely not.
LEADMALE:- Mork, come, sit down.
LEADMALE:- Sense of impending doom.
SUPMALE:Now, here we go.
LEADMALE:Let's sit down and talk.
LEADMALE:Not-- Not on your face.
LEADFEMALE:Now, Mork, Mork Mork, I realise you're an alien that doesn't know his elbow from his raznick.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, but I never would've done it without your patience and understanding.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, really? Phone.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? It's Mr.
LEADMALE:Sternhagen, my boss.
LEADMALE:Yes, Mr.
SUPMALE:Sternhagen? Yes, I'm still here.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:No, I-- I-- I have a little jeep problem.
LEADFEMALE:You're right, that's no reason to lose my job.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Bye, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Sternhagen.
LEADFEMALE:Good news? I have to be at the station in ten minutes or I'm off the air forever.
LEADMALE:All right, here.
LEADMALE:You just have to fix yourself breakfast, and I'll be home before midnight.
SUPMALE:But-- But-- But, Mind Wait a minute, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Don't leave without giving me a big-- Kiss? I've been ignoring you, haven't I? Well, who could blame you? I didn't realise I was that hard to live with.
LEADMALE:As a roommate, I'm no John Ritter.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, you're terrific.
LEADMALE:Different, but terrific.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, our lives are changing, and we just have to do a better job of changing with them.
OTHERFEMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:From now on, I'm only gonna do my share.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, housework is really hard.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna try not to use so much of myself up at the office that I have nothing left to give to you.
SUPMALE:See, I feel better already.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna have to promise each other that we'll always tell each other how we're feeling.
SUPFEMALE:You got it.
SUPFEMALE:I feel happy now.
SUPMALE:- Well, that's good.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah, and now, I feel happier.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, really? - Now it feels like almost joy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it is joy.
OTHERFEMALE:Goodbye, joy, hello, ecstasy.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, anybody home? Mork, l love what you've done with your hair.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, Orson.
LEADMALE:Sir, it's me, Mindy McConnell.
OTHERFEMALE:Remember me? I was here a few months ago with Mork-- Silence.
SUPFEMALE:Where is Mork? What's happened to his report? Oh, well, sir, you see, Mork and I started sharing all our responsibilities lately, so here I am.
LEADFEMALE:But if you'd really rather speak to Mork, I could go get-- Just get on with it.
LEADMALE:Oh, okay.
SUPFEMALE:See, my report is really about my and Mork's relationship.
LEADMALE:Again? Wh--? He told you about it? - What did he say? - Everything.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he couldn't have, sir, because a good relationship is always changing and growing.
LEADMALE:But if a relationship works well, why would you want to change it? Well, sometimes there's no choice.
LEADMALE:I mean, you never know what hurdles life is gonna place in front of you.
LEADMALE:And each one is a test of how much you care.
LEADFEMALE:And sometimes, even if you don't have trouble getting over them, your partner may.
OTHERFEMALE:So you either stop and help them over or you go on alone.
SUPFEMALE:- Did I do all right? - Not bad for an Earthling.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's big of you, sir.
SUPFEMALE:No, I-- No, I didn't mean ''big.
LEADFEMALE:'' I meant, that's good of you, sir.
LEADMALE:Did--? Maybe we can do this again sometime soon.
LEADFEMALE:Don't press your luck.
SUPMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Well, this is Mindy McConnell signing off for Mork.
