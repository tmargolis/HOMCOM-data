SUPMALE:Hey, come on, honey.
SUPMALE:Your plane leaves in an hour.
SUPFEMALE:All set.
SUPFEMALE:Except for Mork.
LEADMALE:I wonder why he ran out at the last minute like that.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey, Mork wouldn't miss seeing you off.
OTHERMALE:After all, going to Topeka is a big deal.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, covering the Winter Wheat Conference is a big deal.
LEADMALE:Who's gonna pick you up at the airport? A chartered tractor? No.
OTHERFEMALE:No, it's important, Dad, because Mr.
SUPMALE:Sternhagen at the station said if I do really good on this assignment, he might give me a bigger one.
LEADMALE:Like city hall, congressional scandals, maybe even the Summer Wheat Convention.
LEADMALE:Mind.
OTHERMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Pop, Pop.
LEADMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Pop, Pop, Pop.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind.
SUPMALE:Mind, Mind, Pop, Pop, Mind, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I brought you this wonderful gift.
SUPMALE:Since you're going to Kansas, I got a flea collar for Toto.
LEADMALE:Don't be afraid, there's no place like that.
OTHERMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, thank you.
LEADMALE:I'll pass it along.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, honey, I'll go warm up the car.
LEADMALE:You know, the best way to do that is to blow on its carburettor and say that you love it.
SUPMALE:I'll do that, but I'll hate myself in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Mork, now I want you to pay close attention.
LEADFEMALE:We've got a lot of things to cover if you're gonna manage by yourself.
LEADMALE:Come on, now, Mind, scoff, scoff, derisive laughter.
LEADFEMALE:Me manage by myself? Do you know who you're talking to? Yes.
SUPMALE:- This is the can opener.
SUPFEMALE:- Can opener.
LEADMALE:- This is the coffee pot.
LEADMALE:- Coffee pot.
LEADMALE:Remember what I told you about the blender? Yes, just turn it off.
LEADFEMALE:Don't just stand there waiting for it to flush.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:And remember the most important part.
LEADMALE:You turn it off from the outside.
OTHERMALE:I wondered why my fingernails were getting shorter.
SUPMALE:Well, I gotta run.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna miss you, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you can't miss, Mind, if you aim right here.
LEADMALE:Okay, well, you have a good time, and I'll see you when I get back on Monday.
LEADFEMALE:You have a good time.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about me.
SUPFEMALE:Everything's all right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a superior being - and I can handle everything.
OTHERMALE:- That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:Later, mama.
OTHERFEMALE:Alone again Just to be alone again Well.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess I'll just have to peel it and eat it raw.
LEADMALE:Oh, I've gotta stop thinking about her.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I've gotta stop thinking about her.
SUPMALE:No! Oh, she's not even thinking of me.
SUPFEMALE:She's here.
LEADFEMALE:She got my psychic telegram.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my darling.
LEADFEMALE:My darling.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what a disappointment.
SUPFEMALE:You're no aurora borealis yourself.
LEADMALE:I just came up to tell you, I got a call from our landlord, Mr.
LEADMALE:Klevins.
SUPMALE:He's coming around later to instal smoke alarms in all the apartments.
LEADFEMALE:No more smoke? There goes my chat with Chief White Eagle.
SUPMALE:What? You better get this place cleaned up.
LEADMALE:This Klevins is a real creep.
SUPMALE:He's bounced tenants for having crooked doormats.
LEADMALE:- You really miss Mindy, don't you? - No way.
LEADMALE:Well, where'd you get all the pictures? Shiksamat? What? Listen, maybe it'd help to get your mind off Mindy if you go out with some of your friends.
LEADFEMALE:That's be great, Bick.
LEADFEMALE:How about the two of us? Paint the town pink, huh? - I'm sorry, Mork, I can't.
LEADMALE:- Why not? Because it sounds like a drag.
SUPFEMALE:And I thought he didn't like me.
SUPFEMALE:Hear that, Mind? They're playing our song, darling.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I love it when you wear that perfume, Janitor in a Drum.
LEADFEMALE:You can cure that with some fabric softener.
LEADFEMALE:You know that, don't you? Wait a minute, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:That can only mean one thing.
LEADFEMALE:He's here.
LEADMALE:It's him.
SUPFEMALE:The Orkan Elder.
SUPMALE:What do you mean, no? It's the ancient one, the wisest of the wise.
SUPFEMALE:Stop that.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, quick.
LEADMALE:Down upon your knees.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice touch.
LEADFEMALE:- Rise, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be so formal, Mork.
LEADMALE:You know my name is: I came because it's my birthday.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sir, happy birthday.
LEADFEMALE:Birthday.
LEADMALE:Very touching.
SUPFEMALE:Hard to keep a dry eye.
LEADMALE:I just wish the Orkan aging process wasn't reversed.
LEADMALE:Seems like every day I look in the mirror, I get a little bit cuter.
LEADMALE:- Where does the time go? - I don't know, sir.
LEADMALE:Probably the same place that socks go when you lose them in the dryer.
LEADMALE:How old are you today, sir? In Earth years, 87.
LEADMALE:You know, that's amazing.
OTHERMALE:If you were a dog, you'd be 1 4.
LEADFEMALE:I decided to treat myself and drop in to see you.
SUPMALE:And, especially, the soft-lapped one.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm sorry about that, sir, but she's out of town.
LEADMALE:Sir.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry I missed her.
LEADMALE:They don't make laps like hers on Ork.
LEADMALE:Well, I can entertain you in the traditional Orkan fashion, sir, if you wish to come with me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Orkan checkers.
LEADMALE:- You go first, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Oh, thank you, sir, for the privilege.
SUPFEMALE:- Check.
SUPFEMALE:- Checkmate.
SUPMALE:And I never even saw it coming.
LEADFEMALE:That's why you're the Elder, sir.
LEADMALE:You know, I kept thinking about the two of you down here.
LEADMALE:Especially Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:She's different from us.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah? I know, sir.
LEADFEMALE:You know, sir, the last time you were here, you said you could build a Mindy.
SUPMALE:Can you? I suppose I could.
LEADMALE:I've got my genetic toolkit in the egg.
OTHERFEMALE:What will you do with the one I build you - when the real Mindy gets back? - I could sell her to the Osmonds in case Marie gets trampled at a family reunion.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you sure you only need one hair? You're gonna have to make her head - awfully small for this to fit.
SUPFEMALE:- Of course.
SUPMALE:Didn't you learn anything in your cloning class on Ork? I had to substitute basket weaving for cloning.
LEADMALE:I was on athletic scholarship.
LEADMALE:I need some information on Mindy's character traits.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's very easy, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:She talks like this.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, my name is Mindy, I'm a Capricorn.
LEADMALE:I like fuzzy things, happy people, solar energy, and whistling at construction workers.
OTHERMALE:Turnoffs are gas-guzzling cars, cancer-causing agents, nuclear power plants and bathroom poetry.
LEADFEMALE:If I wasn't so modest, I'd say I was adorable.
LEADMALE:Excellent.
LEADMALE:Now hand me the Kapovney clamp so I can adjust her lQ.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Please, sir, remember that she's quite intelligent, she has a degree, and she knows about everything.
SUPFEMALE:Watering plants, driving a jeep.
LEADFEMALE:She can tie her shoe without looking down.
SUPMALE:She's almost done.
OTHERMALE:Oh, sir, please remember she was wearing a pink sweater and jeans.
LEADMALE:And remember to put her nose right between her eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Sir? Oh, sir? Sir, she's ready, sir.
OTHERMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADFEMALE:I may be old, but I'm not deaf.
LEADMALE:Oh, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sir.
LEADMALE:- Sir, it worked.
LEADMALE:It's an exact duplicate.
LEADMALE:- Of course.
LEADFEMALE:Talk to her.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mind.
LEADMALE:Big kiss.
LEADMALE:If you think I'm going to flex my orbicular muscle to osculate, you're sadly mistaken.
LEADFEMALE:- What'd she say? - No.
SUPFEMALE:This idle discourse fatigues me.
OTHERMALE:But don't you remember? It's me, your cute little old Morkie.
LEADMALE:Enough of this childish drivel.
SUPFEMALE:I need mental stimulation.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you have any books to read? No.
LEADMALE:I have some to colour.
LEADMALE:Never mind, I'll write my own.
SUPMALE:But Mind.
LEADMALE:Call me when you've evolved.
SUPFEMALE:Sir, I think you made her a little too intelligent.
LEADMALE:- What happened? - Well, sir, meaning no disrespect, but I think you really orked up.
LEADMALE:Begging your pardon, sir, what was wrong with Mindy's clone? I mean, if we were gonna have a battle of wits, I'd be an unarmed man.
SUPMALE:These Earthlings must be more complex than I thought.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sir.
OTHERMALE:Don't give up.
LEADMALE:Please, try again.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I'm real lonely.
SUPFEMALE:Remember, sir, I mean, she's more the outdoor type.
SUPFEMALE:She's energetic and athletic.
LEADFEMALE:She's not a spectator, she's a doer.
OTHERFEMALE:This one will be right.
SUPMALE:An elder never fails, twice.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, bless you, sir, bless you.
SUPFEMALE:May your shoes always be loose.
LEADFEMALE:Tingling, sense of anticipation.
OTHERFEMALE:Sir? Sir? It's happening again, sir.
SUPFEMALE:I think we got a hot one, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:- Hi, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Big kiss.
LEADMALE:- Not now.
LEADMALE:I'm in training.
SUPFEMALE:That's real athletic and energetic, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:But how do you turn her off, though, sir? The deactivating button is on her foot.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, I'm not going near her without a whip and a chair.
LEADMALE:Come on, two out of three, two out of three.
SUPFEMALE:- Now it's your turn, Mind.
LEADMALE:- Come on.
LEADMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt, aunt.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, uncle, uncle, uncle.
LEADMALE:End of round one, neutral corners.
SUPMALE:Sir, can I borrow this? Sir, can you make the next one a little more loving and affectionate? One less turn on the butch bolt? - I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:I hope it's Gore Vidal come to borrow a cup of aphorisms.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no, no.
OTHERMALE:We can't let anybody see you.
LEADMALE:I opt to remain.
LEADFEMALE:I feel the need for social discourse on a much higher level.
LEADMALE:You have proved to me that Darwin was wrong.
SUPMALE:Pardon me, possibly we could find a harmonious resolution to this imbroglio by a conflict of intellects, i.
SUPFEMALE:e.
LEADFEMALE:, a battle of wits, whereby the loser must forfeit an article of clothing and reveal epidermis.
OTHERFEMALE:- A strip debate.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yes, if you catch my drift, yes.
SUPFEMALE:Very well.
LEADFEMALE:Let's discuss the Cartesian dictum: - ''I think, therefore I am.
LEADFEMALE:'' - Therefore.
SUPFEMALE:And how it relates to Kierkegaard's observation that a relation which relates itself to its own self must have been created by itself or created by another.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, fascinating.
SUPFEMALE:However, your possession of extraneous literature constitutes a foul.
LEADFEMALE:Therefore, please, remit to me your left pedal extremity, if you can.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you very much.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry about that, Mind.
SUPMALE:I mean, I'd have a very hard time explaining you.
LEADMALE:And you would have a very hard time explaining you.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:- Who is it? - It's me, Al Klevins, the landlord.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'll be right there, Mr.
LEADMALE:Klevins.
SUPMALE:All right, tidy up.
SUPMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Hi, you must be the creep.
LEADMALE:Creep? I don't know you and already I'm not liking you.
LEADFEMALE:Where's my tenant, Mindy McConnell? Oh, she's in Kansas right now, looking for a small dog at a midget convention.
LEADMALE:- Who are you? - Mork, the man who lights up her life.
LEADMALE:This place is a mess.
LEADFEMALE:I don't see how you can tell with all this junk lying around.
LEADFEMALE:I have no time for this chitchat.
OTHERFEMALE:I gotta instal this smoke alarm so that people like you won't light up my life.
SUPFEMALE:I'll put it here, in the bedroom over there.
OTHERMALE:Oh, if you ever hear this: Put out the fire, then leave.
OTHERMALE:- Round two.
LEADMALE:- Wait, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:That was a buzzer, not a bell.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna squeeze you like a tube of anchovy paste.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:You'll never take me alive.
LEADMALE:Sorry about that, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait, wait, I've got them coming and going here.
SUPMALE:Hold on a second.
LEADMALE:What are we doing, Rockette kicks? What? No time for learn yoga.
OTHERFEMALE:Wish I could get a deposit on all these empties.
LEADFEMALE:Well, hi there, hot stuff.
LEADMALE:Big kiss.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, Mind.
LEADMALE:I asked for somebody warm and more affectionate, not a human hickey maker.
LEADMALE:You're cute.
SUPFEMALE:Today, boy.
SUPMALE:Tonight, man.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, I'm a very kind, innocent little alien.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, please, I wanna wear white at my wedding.
LEADMALE:Why don't I slip into something more comfortable, like skin? No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:You can't go in there.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, try to stop me, blue eyes.
LEADMALE:By tonight, my darling, you'll be needing a lip retread.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling you, I'm going to drive you to China for Jewish food.
SUPFEMALE:I'm starting to get to you, huh? Quick.
LEADMALE:Fondle me with your eyes.
SUPFEMALE:Tell you what, let's sip champagne from your slipper, eh, ma petite? All right, my scruffy rogue.
LEADMALE:- Find it first.
LEADMALE:- Oh, I'll find it for you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, bingo.
OTHERFEMALE:I will sip from no slipper before its time.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, let's make it a double.
LEADFEMALE:At least I found her turnoff.
LEADFEMALE:Up she go.
LEADMALE:Make room for one more.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we're stacking up like cordwood in here.
LEADFEMALE:Would you stay calm? - Hey, you? - Hello.
LEADFEMALE:- What are you doing? - Oh, just tidying up.
SUPMALE:I saw what you did.
OTHERFEMALE:You put a person in there.
OTHERMALE:In fact, it looks like Miss McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:It's Ms.
OTHERFEMALE:McConnell to you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna call the police.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna call the police.
LEADFEMALE:- It's just an ostrich.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:- No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:You're a murderer.
LEADFEMALE:That's what you are.
OTHERFEMALE:No, please, you don't understand.
LEADMALE:Hello? Hello, operator.
SUPMALE:Get me the police.
SUPFEMALE:I want to report a murder.
SUPFEMALE:- No, you don't understand.
SUPMALE:- Hi, Mork.
LEADMALE:Never mind.
SUPFEMALE:It's not as important as I thought.
OTHERFEMALE:Miss McConnell, you're alive.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:So are you.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on here? Yeah, but you can't be here.
SUPMALE:I just saw him stuff your body into that closet.
LEADMALE:- Here, I'll show you.
LEADMALE:- No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:It's an ostrich convention.
LEADFEMALE:You don't wanna disturb them.
OTHERMALE:Look, I saw you put someone in there, and I'm gonna find out what's going on around here.
LEADMALE:All right! All right, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Smarty-Pants.
LEADFEMALE:You wanna know what's in there? - Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:- Okay.
SUPMALE:I'll show you what's in there.
LEADFEMALE:I'm opening the door.
OTHERMALE:I'm reaching in.
LEADFEMALE:It's just your typical mop with jeans and a sweater.
LEADMALE:A perfectly logical explanation.
SUPMALE:Sort of.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm getting out of here.
OTHERMALE:I can't-- I'm getting out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I'll move back to the Bronx, where it's safe.
SUPMALE:What is going on here? Why does this mop have my picture on it? - That's kind of hard to explain, Mind.
LEADMALE:- Oh, I'll bet.
SUPMALE:- Now, what's really in the armoire? - Mind, Mind, you don't wanna Mork, where'd you get the dead Mindys? They're not dead, Mind.
LEADMALE:It's just my personal pile of perkiness.
LEADMALE:- Don't touch their feet, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:- Touch their feet? I don't even wanna touch the armoire.
LEADMALE:What are they doing in there? - Well, the Elder made them, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- The Eld--? The Elder's here? - He's upstairs, cranking out more.
LEADMALE:- Oh, we gotta to stop him.
LEADFEMALE:Sir-- Sir, what's wrong? I'm a failure, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:An 87-year-old has-been.
SUPMALE:I tried to re-create a Mindy.
LEADMALE:I really tried.
SUPFEMALE:But all I could make were cheap imitations, Iike this one.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sir, this is her, this is the real McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:Please, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Please, Mork, don't humour me.
LEADMALE:Suddenly, I feel very old.
OTHERFEMALE:The soft-lapped one.
LEADMALE:It's really you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course it's me.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome to Earth.
LEADFEMALE:What are all those mes doing in the closet? Oh, Mind, don't blame him.
LEADFEMALE:I asked him to make them for me because I really missed you.
SUPMALE:Well, I missed you too, Mork, but that's a little strange.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, they look just like me.
SUPMALE:That's just on the outside, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:But that's not the part we really missed.
LEADMALE:I've learned a valuable lesson.
OTHERFEMALE:Humans aren't toys to tinker with.
OTHERFEMALE:Seeing you again is the best birthday present I could possibly have.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's your birthday? Oh, happy birthday.
LEADFEMALE:If I were only 30 bleams younger, then I'd still be too old for you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what about all the Mindys? Oh, I'll take them back to Ork for scientific study.
OTHERFEMALE:You can keep the one upstairs.
OTHERFEMALE:Upstairs? You mean there's another one up in the attic? Yes, except she didn't turn out exactly as I hoped.
LEADFEMALE:Let me introduce you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mindy? Mindy? Hi, Mork.
LEADMALE:Big kiss.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Your Jelly-Bellyness.
SUPFEMALE:You like that one, Beebs? Does that tickle your fancy? I've got a million of them.
SUPFEMALE:And l've heard them all, twice.
OTHERMALE:- Get to your report, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, yes, sir, Your Snippiness.
OTHERMALE:This week, sir, I've prepared a very, very special report for you.
SUPMALE:I finally found out what distinguishes one Earthling from another.
LEADMALE:Funny.
LEADFEMALE:They all look alike to me.
LEADFEMALE:That may be true, mein hippodrome, but every person has something that makes him unique and very special.
SUPMALE:- It's called a personality.
LEADFEMALE:- Could you show me one? Well, no, sir, it's not something you could see or touch.
LEADMALE:But it's something that reaches out and touches people.
SUPMALE:It makes each one of them very, very, very different.
LEADFEMALE:- Isn't that inefficient? - Oh, you bet, sir, but that's what makes life on this planet so darn interesting.
LEADFEMALE:You see, sir, thanks to personalities, even the most identical twin is not the same.
SUPFEMALE:Even the shortest person can stand out in a crowd.
LEADMALE:They may have the same number of chromosomes but each person has his own designer genes.
SUPMALE:Until next week, sir, na-no, na-no.
LEADFEMALE:
