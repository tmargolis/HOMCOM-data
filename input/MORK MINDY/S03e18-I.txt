OTHERMALE:Oh, Mindy, dinner was delicious.
LEADFEMALE:Since Kathy's away, I'm grateful for any meal that doesn't begin with the word ''instant.
LEADMALE:'' You certainly are in a good mood today considering Uncle Dave is coming into town tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, we never got along very well.
LEADFEMALE:It's just, well, he's always accomplished more than I did and he let me know about it.
SUPFEMALE:He's always been a little eccentric.
LEADMALE:Is that why every time you see him, you break out in hives? Yeah, maybe this time it will be different.
LEADMALE:After all, it's been seven years since I've seen him.
SUPMALE:And he reminded me of his island in the Caribbean.
OTHERFEMALE:And my mortgage in Boulder.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you can stop scratching, Dad.
LEADMALE:I'll make him a great dinner and tell Mork not to cut his meat with his finger.
LEADFEMALE:Am I home yet, Mind? Yes, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, thank goodness.
OTHERFEMALE:This is the sixth house I've backed into.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I'll ask.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, why are you walking backwards? What? I'm celebrating my heritage, Mind, this is National Backwards Day.
SUPFEMALE:It something that everyone looks forward to on Ork.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm in big trouble.
LEADMALE:Oh, Pops, nice not seeing you.
LEADFEMALE:So you've been out walking around all day backwards.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't people stare at you? I don't know, Mind, I don't have eyes in the back of my head.
LEADMALE:Well, I have to go.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, just make sure you turn him around by the time Dave gets here.
LEADMALE:Oh, Pops, don't start scratching yet.
SUPFEMALE:That holiday's not until next month.
LEADFEMALE:So, Mork, how long does National Backwards Day last? - In Earth years, Mind? - Mork It's over, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, who's Dave? Oh, Dave is Dad's brother.
OTHERFEMALE:Pop has a biological brother? Is he older, younger, male, female? Well, he's older.
SUPMALE:And brothers are almost usually always male.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, not Dr.
SUPMALE:Joyce Brothers.
OTHERMALE:It's been years since we've seen Uncle Dave and Aunt Caroline.
LEADMALE:Dad really wants to impress his brother, so please try to act like an earthling.
SUPFEMALE:You got it, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Who do you want me to be? Catchy tune.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's here, it's my package from Ork.
LEADMALE:I ordered it special delivery.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, and no tip.
SUPMALE:You were slow opening.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind.
LEADMALE:- What--? - Ceremonial food for Backwards Day.
SUPFEMALE:- What is it? - It's called flek.
SUPMALE:- Flek? What's that? It's like nargle, except when you eat it, you don't grow feathers.
LEADMALE:It sure doesn't look like food.
LEADFEMALE:Well, these are seeds, Mind.
LEADMALE:You just plant them and up comes flek.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:There, little one And time and growth will know Mork, on Ork, do all plants grow that fast? Yes, Mindy, but on Ork, even the begonias have stretch marks.
SUPMALE:- Hello, Caroline.
SUPFEMALE:- Fred, dear, how nice to see you.
SUPMALE:Hi, Aunt Caroline.
LEADMALE:- And this can't be Mindy.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
SUPMALE:Oh, my, what a big girl you've grown up to be.
SUPMALE:So where's that big brother of mine? Oh, Dave, dear, Fred and Mindy are here.
LEADMALE:Oh, he just can't wait to see you.
LEADMALE:Junior, as I make it, you're four minutes late.
OTHERFEMALE:I've bought companies in less time.
LEADFEMALE:Well, yes, I know, Dave, but it's wonderful to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:This is Mindy, of course.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:What a pretty little girl you are.
LEADFEMALE:The outfit's a little strange.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know about the sweater.
SUPMALE:Doesn't make any difference, doesn't matter.
LEADFEMALE:- Uncle Dave, well, it's nice to see you.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, good.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll save those.
LEADMALE:Well, now you just move your little Adidas into the kitchen and let's get some goodies, huh? Yes, Daddy dear.
SUPMALE:Oh, I don't know what I'd do without her.
SUPFEMALE:I think I'll keep her.
SUPMALE:Tell me something, junior, where's your ball and chain? - My what? - I think he means your little wifey.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, well, Kathy's in Chicago this weekend.
LEADFEMALE:You let her travel? By herself? Oh, she plays flute in a chamber group.
LEADMALE:How fascinating.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:No, they're very good.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, junior.
SUPMALE:You're kidding me.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you got your wife playing the flute in Chicago, putting a stick in her face? You can't cut it on your own? Hey, tell me something incidentally, how's the arm? It itches.
LEADMALE:I mean, you're the maestro, the guy with the baton.
SUPFEMALE:How about a little building up of the biceps? Oh, well, no, no, Dave, come on.
LEADMALE:I think we're a little old for all of this, don't you? What do you mean, ''a little old,'' junior? Oh, no, no, you're never too old for the taste of victory.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right.
SUPMALE:Here we go, okay? Okay? One more for me.
SUPMALE:Now you have a real disadvantage.
OTHERMALE:Okay, all right, ready? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Dave McConnell here.
SUPFEMALE:About what? You want me to speak to the Boulder Association? - Uncle Dave.
SUPMALE:- Oh, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:I thought you and Aunt Caroline were having dinner at my house tonight.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's right, but what time are we eating, sweetheart? Seven-thirty? Seven-thirty.
SUPFEMALE:Seven-thirty.
LEADMALE:Listen, how about 9? Okay, boys? I'll be there.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see, where was I? Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess some things never change.
LEADFEMALE:Wrong, junior.
LEADMALE:No, this time you didn't cry for Mommy.
LEADMALE:Let's take a look at it.
LEADMALE:This smells good.
SUPFEMALE:That's good.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, how do my pants look? - Mork, very nice.
LEADFEMALE:- I pressed them myself.
SUPMALE:Do you think I'd get a better crease if I take them off first? Possibly.
SUPMALE:Mork, could you help me finish setting the table? - All right.
OTHERFEMALE:- Uncle Dave is in a hurry.
OTHERMALE:He wants to eat as soon as he gets here.
SUPMALE:Well, maybe we should start out by serving frog's arms.
OTHERFEMALE:We're not serving frog's arms.
LEADMALE:See, we're already ahead of schedule.
LEADMALE:I don't know why we're going to all this trouble for Uncle Dave.
OTHERMALE:I mean, he hasn't been very nice to Dad.
LEADMALE:I'm making this big meal and you made this delicious dessert.
SUPFEMALE:By delicious, Mind, are you inferring that some of this has passed by your lips? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It's good.
SUPMALE:Mind, that was flek.
SUPMALE:- Flek? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:- No earthling's ever eaten it.
LEADFEMALE:- I'm gonna be all right, aren't I? Just be calm and tell me where you keep your stomach pump.
LEADFEMALE:Stomach pump? I didn't mean to frighten you.
LEADMALE:We'll have to use the plunger.
LEADMALE:Open.
LEADMALE:- Mork, come on.
LEADFEMALE:- Mind, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:You're overreacting.
LEADFEMALE:I just ate a tiny piece and I feel fine.
SUPMALE:Oh, will you sign a statement to that effect, Mind? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:I guess if it's okay for Orkans, it's all right for you.
SUPMALE:There's nothing wrong with me that getting through this evening won't cure.
SUPMALE:I'll get it.
LEADMALE:I wonder if Uncle Dave would mind if I tied her to a chair.
SUPMALE:Mork, what did I just do? Something like this: It must be the flek, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:But I feel perfectly normal right now.
SUPMALE:Mindy, it's Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Mork, if I start acting strange again, just cover for me, all right? - Dad's got enough on his mind.
OTHERMALE:- All right, be calm, be calm, be calm.
SUPMALE:- Hello.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'll just put this over here.
LEADMALE:Mindy, you look beautiful, and Mork, you look almost human.
LEADFEMALE:And I really wanna thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I appreciate this.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, will you get up here? - What? What? Will you look at that wall there? - What are we looking at? - Right there at that wall.
SUPFEMALE:It's amazing how the floor and the ceiling kind of butt together right there.
LEADMALE:Mork, that is interesting, but I think maybe tonight it might be a good idea if we don't discuss wall appreciation with Dave.
LEADMALE:That's fine.
LEADFEMALE:Let see, I think we-- Help me here.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Why don't we sit down and have a little snort before dinner? You know how it always relaxes you.
OTHERFEMALE:It relaxes me too, you know.
LEADMALE:How about a little toddy for the body? Mindy, are you all right? Mork, I can't seem to control myself.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, why does this have to happen tonight? I don't know, Mind That's Dave.
OTHERMALE:He never has time to knock twice.
SUPMALE:Oh, I shall get it.
OTHERFEMALE:No, let me.
OTHERMALE:I'll answer it.
OTHERFEMALE:What's she doing? The bunny hop.
OTHERMALE:Listen, Mindy, what's going on around here? - Hello.
SUPMALE:- Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Caroline.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Dave.
LEADMALE:Hello, my name is Mork.
SUPMALE:I'm the Caucasian help this evening.
LEADFEMALE:I do not live with Mindy and it's a pleasure to have you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Well, come on, let's eat, junior.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, time is Krugerrands.
OTHERFEMALE:It's nice having you here, Uncle Dave.
OTHERFEMALE:My dear, what a lovely apartment.
LEADFEMALE:I just love way-- Please, please, you keep chattering, Mother, and we're gonna miss dessert.
LEADMALE:Well, Dave, I certainly hope you're hungry, because Mindy's prepared a wonderful dinner.
OTHERMALE:Incidentally, Mother, do you wanna pass along this fine bottle of sauce to junior? ''Chateau Lafitte McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:'' Your own vineyard.
LEADFEMALE:That's quite impressive, Dave.
LEADFEMALE:The fact is it's Mother's and mine, isn't it? Just north of Napa, a huge monastery, about 50 monks.
LEADMALE:We lost four.
OTHERFEMALE:Jumped a bus or something, I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Any rate, long about late July, early August, those little devils come out.
OTHERMALE:Jumping up and down their little feet and pressing out these grapes.
LEADMALE:Of course, there are no women at the monastery, are there, Mother? No, there are not.
LEADFEMALE:So you just see them jumping up and down, their little feet going away, stepping on those little grapes.
LEADMALE:Oh, Uncle Dave, sir, Aunt Caroline, can I show you the rest of the house? There's the attic up there, there's the bedroom over here.
LEADMALE:This is our living room, or as we like to call it, our ''living space.
OTHERMALE:'' Mindy, are you all right? Yes, I'll explain it to you later, but, Dad, I'm fine.
OTHERMALE:No, no, no, dinner's ready.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, well, let's all sit down, shall we? - Okay, let's go there.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go over and sit down.
SUPFEMALE:This is a very special occasion.
SUPMALE:Normally we have duck in a bucket.
SUPFEMALE:Here you are, Mother.
LEADFEMALE:Beat you to it, jelly belly.
LEADFEMALE:Get some therapy for her.
SUPMALE:Therapy.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, are you all right? She normally likes to do this, it's kind of like punk grace: ''Can you light the poo-bee?'' Mindy.
SUPMALE:Mindy, I am all hungry.
LEADFEMALE:Could I have something to eat? Would you like an olive? Yes, I'd like an olive.
LEADMALE:Good, good.
LEADFEMALE:Bombs away.
OTHERMALE:I wanna tell you something.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna tell you something.
LEADMALE:Fit her for an electric bonnet now.
LEADFEMALE:Set it at 580.
SUPMALE:Dave, I think that's just Mindy's way of making a little joke.
OTHERMALE:You should see her when she touches her tongue to her eyebrow.
LEADMALE:We haven't had a fly in here in three years.
SUPMALE:I'm telling you, you should put a muzzle on her and send her to an obedience school.
OTHERMALE:Hey, pickle puss.
SUPFEMALE:That does it.
SUPMALE:That does it.
SUPMALE:That does it.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Caroline, let's go.
LEADMALE:Let's get the coats.
SUPFEMALE:Next thing, she'll be howling at the moon.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:- I don't think she would do that.
LEADMALE:- No, please.
SUPMALE:- Would she? - I'm not sure.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait, Uncle Dave.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Dave, come back.
LEADMALE:Please, Aunt Caroline.
OTHERMALE:I don't know what came over me.
SUPFEMALE:Neither do I.
LEADMALE:Oh, I really apologise.
LEADMALE:You haven't even finished dinner and this means so much to Dad and me.
LEADMALE:Dave, look, I don't know what's come over Mindy, but please stay.
LEADMALE:Are you kidding? I told Caroline, I told you, coming in on the plane, this was gonna be a bummer of a reunion.
SUPMALE:And it's a bummer.
SUPFEMALE:I want out.
LEADMALE:I want out.
SUPFEMALE:But, Uncle Dave, sir, you can't leave with bitter memories in your mind.
LEADMALE:Why not leave with something sweet? Like, I have this dessert I made.
OTHERFEMALE:And you have to try it.
LEADMALE:Please? You know, incidentally, you seem like the only normal one here.
LEADFEMALE:Not bad, not bad.
LEADMALE:A little on the tart side, kind of gritty.
SUPMALE:Uncle Dave? Are you feeling all right? Right, right, right.
OTHERMALE:Of course I'm feeling all right, right, right, right.
LEADMALE:Left, left, left, company! All right, little girl, these are the trenches.
SUPMALE:Not easy to ride a horse in a trench, is it? Go on back in the tents there with the young children.
LEADMALE:Stay in that barn until the war's over.
LEADMALE:You, help with the walking wounded.
LEADFEMALE:They must be walking, however.
OTHERMALE:Crossed in front of a horse.
LEADFEMALE:Easy.
LEADFEMALE:All right, easy.
LEADFEMALE:Men, take a look at it.
LEADMALE:It's Whitey.
LEADMALE:No, the horse.
LEADFEMALE:There.
LEADMALE:Sergeant Major.
LEADFEMALE:Good to see you.
SUPFEMALE:Captain Bevre here.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, First Imperial Fusselieres.
LEADFEMALE:They were ready These are the trenches, of course.
LEADMALE:Hey, man, what's going on? I'm an American.
SUPFEMALE:Cheers, cheers.
SUPFEMALE:What division? Rainbow division.
OTHERMALE:Come on, man, shape up or ship out.
OTHERFEMALE:Love you, love you.
LEADMALE:Let's attack anyway.
SUPFEMALE:Brian, Brian.
LEADMALE:Oh, black people.
LEADFEMALE:Please, come over here.
LEADFEMALE:God bless you.
LEADFEMALE:I was kicked out of Sanders.
LEADFEMALE:They found me in a dress.
LEADMALE:Doesn't make any difference.
LEADMALE:Found you in what? - A gown.
LEADFEMALE:- A gown's better.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Father, look, thousands of Huns.
SUPFEMALE:- Bosch.
LEADFEMALE:- Yes, Bosch, Germans and Bosch.
SUPFEMALE:- Well - What's the Bosch? We're out of small soup with beets.
LEADFEMALE:I suppose.
LEADFEMALE:- We have some tools in the back.
LEADFEMALE:- Where? Where are they? How about this? Oh, my hand.
LEADMALE:My hand.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Hey, get it out.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, I'm hurt.
SUPFEMALE:I'm hurt.
LEADMALE:- I know you are, but you've killed the old man with four fingers in his head.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like the bloody war's over.
SUPMALE:- No, sir.
LEADMALE:- What a shame.
SUPFEMALE:And I've had no action.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I can't-- No, it's my medallions.
LEADMALE:We'll see you after the war, probably in a VW.
SUPFEMALE:Did somebody switch brothers on me? Oh, I've never seen him act like this before.
LEADMALE:Oh, I don't mean to pry, dear, but are you back from the war yet? Dave, what's come over you? Oh, I don't know, junior.
LEADMALE:I was just playing.
LEADFEMALE:You never did that with me.
LEADMALE:I mean, you never played with me when we were kids.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I know that.
LEADMALE:When I came along, as you know, I was first.
OTHERFEMALE:I was first.
LEADFEMALE:I knew at three years of age, I was first.
SUPFEMALE:They gave me a little kitty and a little doggy, and then Daddy would bounce me on his knee, left knee and then on his right knee.
SUPFEMALE:Then Mommy would just bounce me, she'd dribble me: And shoot me, and I'd say: And then you came along.
SUPFEMALE:I suppose I was jealous, insanely jealous.
OTHERFEMALE:I saw your little body in a 50-by-20 bed.
LEADMALE:They played with you, painted you up, made you a bizarre child.
SUPFEMALE:I began to hate you, hate you, hate you.
LEADMALE:And I don't like you anymore.
LEADMALE:I don't like you, Freddie.
LEADMALE:Don't like you, junior.
LEADMALE:You wonder why I'm different? Why I'm twisted and bent out of shape? Because you took my parents from me.
SUPFEMALE:Now, don't worry, Aunt Caroline.
SUPFEMALE:If anybody can find Uncle Dave, Mork can.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork, any luck? - No, I found him.
SUPFEMALE:You'll never guess where.
OTHERMALE:Time's up.
SUPMALE:Top of the flagpole, city hall.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Dave, dear, are you all right? Dave, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Now, Dave.
SUPFEMALE:Dave, look.
LEADFEMALE:Wait Well, excuse me, I think Dave needs me.
OTHERFEMALE:To yell at.
SUPFEMALE:It was the flek, Dad.
LEADMALE:He'll calm down.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Flek or no flek, Dave's right.
SUPFEMALE:We've never gotten along.
SUPMALE:We never will.
LEADMALE:But he's your brother, and he happens to feel like you've robbed him of something special.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want me to say to him? He doesn't listen.
SUPFEMALE:I'll talk to him, Pops.
LEADMALE:Who talked him out of the lobster tank at the Seafood Shanty? Now, Dave, I think Well, I guess he can't make it any worse than it already is.
SUPMALE:All right, let's go.
SUPMALE:Wait, wait, wait, Mind.
SUPMALE:Wait, wait.
SUPMALE:Let me tell you what Uncle Dave said first, he said: ''Tell junior, when I walk out, I don't wanna see him in this room, any room, anywhere, that even includes a sleazy hotel in Bangkok.
LEADMALE:'' It was wonderful seeing you and it's a good thing we did, because we'll probably never see you again.
LEADMALE:Dave, I don't want it to end like this.
LEADFEMALE:Just tell it to the doorman downstairs.
SUPMALE:Oh, now, you just hold it, brother.
SUPMALE:All my life, you've ignored me.
SUPFEMALE:You've humiliated me and you've made me itch like the devil, and I never stopped trying to win your approval.
LEADMALE:Do you know what it's like to love a brother and he doesn't love you back? It hurts.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, Dave.
SUPFEMALE:I still wish you well.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, kids, let's go.
LEADMALE:Oh, Daddy, you're so good at negotiating.
SUPFEMALE:Say something.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, junior.
LEADFEMALE:Give me a minute, will you? I learned a lot this evening.
LEADFEMALE:I really did.
LEADMALE:You made a fool out of me, man.
SUPFEMALE:I came off looking bad.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it's better that way, but I don't want it that way any longer.
SUPMALE:I want it to be right.
OTHERFEMALE:Folks are gone, and You and I are still brothers and we're still alive, still very much alive.
OTHERFEMALE:I want your love as bad as you want mine.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, come on, put it there, Freddie.
SUPMALE:You're still a dynamo.
LEADMALE:Oh, you rascal.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, why don't I take us all to dinner? Get your purse, will you, sweetheart? What's that for? For giving my father a brother.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, O mighty sequoia.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you call me sequoia, Mork? Well, sir, it's the fattest tree that I know.
OTHERMALE:- y our report, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Yes, sir.
SUPMALE:This week, sir, I learned about competition.
LEADFEMALE:The type of competition between different branches of the same family tree.
LEADFEMALE:You see, sir, how that it all ties it in, tree, roots, things like that.
LEADFEMALE:y ou told me earthlings were very competitive, but l didn't know they brought it home with them, Mork.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, sir, you see, sibling rivalry has been around for a long time.
OTHERMALE:Started with Cain and Abel competing for God's attention right through Donny and Marie competing for the same hairdo.
SUPMALE:Oh, Donny, why? But isn't competition a healthy thing? Well, sir, it can be.
SUPMALE:You see, I think a family should be like a team.
LEADFEMALE:They shouldn't be forced to wear pads to protect each other from contact.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone should be rooting each other on.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why don't they? Your Spruce Gooseness, it starts with one person comparing himself to another and he forgets that the only standards he has to meet are the ones he sets for himself.
SUPFEMALE:But isn't it through competition that greater heights are reached? Yes, sir, but I don't think you should use your family as stepping stones.
SUPMALE:Until next week, sir, na-no.
