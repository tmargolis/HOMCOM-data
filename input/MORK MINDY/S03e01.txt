LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dad, it's so good to have you back.
OTHERMALE:How was your trip? Well, Baltimore was okay, but after two months in a hotel room, l was ready to come home.
LEADMALE:From the clippings you sent, it sounds as if your orchestra was well received.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it was great to hear all those people coming out of the concert hall whistling Stravinsky.
SUPFEMALE:So how have things been going around here? - Not so good, Dad.
SUPMALE:lt's Mork.
OTHERMALE:- lt's always Mork.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait till you see him.
LEADMALE:He's really changed.
OTHERMALE:- ln what way? - You wouldn't believe it.
SUPMALE:lt's the last thing in the world you'd expect from Mork.
LEADFEMALE:How much could he change? Unless he's grown another head.
LEADMALE:Kitten, l'm home.
LEADFEMALE:Another day Another day, another inflated dollar.
LEADMALE:Hello, hon.
LEADMALE:Big kiss.
LEADFEMALE:Fred, really good to see you.
LEADFEMALE:How are you? How's Baltimore? l hear it's quite a little town, eh? Was it hot enough for you? How about all those dead toads? Well, what's for dinner, hon? l hope it's that mock pot roast again.
LEADMALE:What she can do with a cracker.
SUPMALE:Watch out.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's see in here.
LEADMALE:Another big kiss.
OTHERMALE:He seems fine to me.
SUPMALE:Almost normal.
SUPFEMALE:But that's the problem.
OTHERMALE:He's too normal.
LEADMALE:Mayonnaise.
LEADMALE:l can't get enough of it.
LEADFEMALE:Really good to see you, Fred.
LEADMALE:He used to say ""na-no, na-no.
OTHERMALE:"" Oh, none of that immigrant talk for me, hon.
LEADMALE:- Hey.
SUPFEMALE:You got a haircut.
OTHERMALE:- l got them all cut.
SUPMALE:My broker told me that one.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what a mind, what a mind.
OTHERMALE:Well, Fred, how do you like this new suit? Yeah, l was just admiring it.
OTHERMALE:l have one just like it.
SUPFEMALE:Doesn't everyone? What kind of a host am l? Some kind of bozo.
OTHERFEMALE:Can l get you a cocktail? How about a little Campari and Tab? How about that? lt's incredible.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:No, thanks, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- lt's not Mork anymore, Fred.
OTHERFEMALE:- Wait till you hear this.
SUPMALE:lt's too ethnic.
LEADFEMALE:Call me Morrie.
LEADFEMALE:A spaceman named Morrie.
LEADFEMALE:l'm working with children now, Fred, at a daycare centre, you know, because l think they're the future of America, tomorrow's Republicans.
SUPFEMALE:Daycare centre.
LEADMALE:That sounds interesting.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's a start, Fred.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, we've got our future to think about, right, hon? Right, Morrie.
LEADFEMALE:Morrie.
LEADMALE:Oh, Minnie.
LEADFEMALE:Morrie and Minnie.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds like something you'd see on the TV, doesn't it? - Do you play canasta, Fred? - Canasta? Mindy, l wouldn't worry about this fella.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, l used to think you were strange and peculiar, but now, gosh, you're just like one of us.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but, Daddy, he never does Orkan things anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Like, he completely stopped drinking with his finger.
SUPFEMALE:That's an old-planet custom, hon.
OTHERMALE:And l've also stopped spitting with my toe.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, who wants a lot of drool in your socks? Well, l've gotta be getting home.
LEADMALE:Cathy is fixing a meat loaf for dinner tonight.
LEADMALE:My favourite.
LEADFEMALE:Here's a little tip for you, Fred: Try it with ketchup.
LEADMALE:Hey, how about tomorrow, maybe you and l will play a little golf? - Well, l'd like that.
LEADFEMALE:- And we'll talk about some politics.
SUPMALE:Do you really think that Earl Scheib does Ronald Reagan's hair? Honey, goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:And trust me, everything is gonna be all right.
LEADMALE:lt's gonna be wonderful.
OTHERMALE:l'll see you on the first tee.
OTHERFEMALE:Fore.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mindy, now l understand where you inherited your zest for life.
LEADMALE:l think l'll just relax, watch a little TV.
LEADMALE:- Can l talk to you for a minute, Mork? - Oh, not right now, hon.
LEADMALE:Merv's gonna sing ''My Way'' underwater with an Aqua-Lung with Jacques Cousteau.
LEADMALE:l'd like to see Phil Donahue do that.
LEADMALE:Well, it's kind of important.
LEADMALE:See, it's sort of been building up for the last couple of weeks.
LEADFEMALE:l don't really know how to put this into words, but you've just changed so much.
LEADMALE:- Now, hon-- - You're just like an Earthling.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, big kiss.
LEADFEMALE:- No.
LEADMALE:l'm just afraid that there's something going wrong between us.
LEADMALE:Oh, what can go wrong, hon? We've got the whole night planned out here.
LEADFEMALE:Look, we'll start off with That"s IncredibIe! And tonight Bo Derek is gonna try to count to ten.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, look.
OTHERFEMALE:On Lou Grant, he's gonna change his shirt.
SUPFEMALE:Watch out.
SUPMALE:Oh, and on Quincy, ''Quincy falls in love during an autopsy.
LEADFEMALE:'' Well, that's a dead giveaway.
SUPMALE:Big kiss.
SUPFEMALE:Mind? Mind, hon.
OTHERFEMALE:Kitten, what you doing up? What's wrong, Mind? Mind, you're crying.
OTHERFEMALE:You used to say, ''Your eyes are leaking.
LEADFEMALE:'' l did? Oh, Mork, when you first came to Earth, you were so exciting, so different and special.
LEADFEMALE:But l think that l've ruined all that.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, l'm still the same.
SUPMALE:See? No, it's my fault.
OTHERMALE:l'm the one who told you not to act strange in public and not to sit on your face or not to feed the pigeons with a fork.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that was great, Mind.
LEADMALE:You taught me a lot.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, don't you see? l taught you too much.
OTHERMALE:l've created an Earthling.
LEADMALE:Yeah, l guess that's me, Morrie Q.
LEADMALE:Public.
LEADFEMALE:Because of me, you've lost everything that made you so wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:You think so, hon? Oh, Mork, we've got a big problem.
LEADFEMALE:l've had to make a really tough decision.
LEADFEMALE:l don't think you should live here anymore.
LEADMALE:- You don't? - No.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe if you're out on your own, that special quality might come back.
LEADMALE:There's gotta be something we can do.
LEADFEMALE:l mean, there must be someone who can help us.
SUPMALE:There's no one on Earth who's even gonna believe us.
OTHERMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:There is one person.
LEADFEMALE:There is someone who can help us.
LEADMALE:Stick your finger in my ear.
OTHERFEMALE:- l beg your pardon? - No, no, Mind.
SUPMALE:l mean we're gonna talk to Orson, you and l both.
SUPMALE:But first, l've gotta plug you into my mind, so stick your finger in my ear, hold my nose.
SUPFEMALE:You mean l'm gonna go with you into your head? - lnto your mind? Can l do that? - Well, there's plenty of room.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this is very strange.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you should have seen the old way.
LEADFEMALE:Hold on.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, l think that's how it goes, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, big buddy.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:l mean, who'd ever believe this? l'm inside an actual head.
SUPFEMALE:lt just doesn't seem possible.
OTHERFEMALE:But here l am, Mindy McConnell, who's never even been to New York.
LEADFEMALE:SiIence.
LEADFEMALE:- Somebody else is in here.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, it's just Orson.
SUPFEMALE:See? Sir, l brought my friend Mindy to talk to you.
LEADMALE:An EarthIing in your mind? This is highIy unusuaI, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:l know that, sir, but it's very important.
LEADMALE:l couldn't do it by myself.
SUPMALE:l seem to be losing my Orkan-ness.
LEADMALE:Tell him, hon.
LEADMALE:Hi, sir.
LEADMALE:- Orson.
LEADFEMALE:- Orson.
LEADMALE:- Sir.
LEADMALE:Obesity.
LEADMALE:- Sir.
LEADFEMALE:- No.
LEADMALE:- No.
LEADMALE:See, the problem seems to be that Mork has been around me so much, he's He's become too much of an Earthling.
LEADMALE:Is that true, Mork? - Yes sirree, bob.
SUPFEMALE:- This is very serious.
LEADMALE:It sounds Iike you"re affIicted with observer syndrome.
SUPMALE:What's that? It can happen when an observer spends too much time on another pIanet.
OTHERMALE:He starts to become Iike the creatures there.
LEADMALE:UnIess Mork can be cured, he"II have to be ostracised.
LEADMALE:Ostracised? Does that mean, like, cast out? He wiII be returned to Ork, where he wiII be stripped of his name, his honour and his uniform.
LEADMALE:Then he wiII be sprayed purpIe and doomed to wander his homeIand forever as a faIIen Orkan.
LEADMALE:- Oh, no.
LEADMALE:- Oh, it's awful, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:No one ever talks to you when you're purple, and the police always hassle you.
SUPMALE:- What have l done? - Perhaps irreparabIe harm.
LEADMALE:- But you said there was a cure.
SUPMALE:- PossibIy.
SUPMALE:I"II have to arrange for Mork to be visited by the most exaIted eIder on Ork.
OTHERMALE:He is very oId and very wise, and he knows aII there is to know about Orkan cuIture.
SUPMALE:If anyone can possibIy retrain Mork in Orkan ways, it"s the Ancient One.
LEADMALE:lt's gotta work, sir.
LEADMALE:l don't wanna be purple.
OTHERMALE:Orson signing off.
SUPFEMALE:Well, goodbye, sir.
LEADMALE:- That's ""na-no, na-no.
OTHERFEMALE:"" - Really? I wiII teII the eIder to pack quickIy.
SUPMALE:That's right, Dad, you heard it.
LEADFEMALE:l was inside Mork's mind, and l actually talked to Orson.
LEADMALE:Well, yeah, he said that he's gonna send down an elder.
LEADMALE:Yeah, a very wise and very old man who's gonna try to teach Mork how to get back to the way he was.
SUPFEMALE:lf it doesn't work, they're gonna paint him purple and l'll never see him again.
OTHERMALE:He's at work at the daycare centre.
LEADMALE:lt might be the last time he gets to see his little friends.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, little neighbours, let's gather round the neighbourhood.
SUPMALE:Come on, here we go.
SUPMALE:Let's go sit around Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Table.
SUPFEMALE:We have another story today.
SUPFEMALE:l'm sorry about yesterday's story.
SUPMALE:That was one by Stephen King, and naptime didn't go very well, did it? Okay, today we have kind of a fable.
SUPFEMALE:That's kind of a funny story.
LEADMALE:Once, a long time ago in a faraway land-- Maybe even a planet, l don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just leave it at that.
LEADMALE:--there lived a little fuzzy creature named Crom.
LEADFEMALE:And he lived in a little hole, kind of like a condominium.
SUPMALE:And one day, a big fuzzy lump-lump came and knocked on the door and said, ''You have to leave.
LEADMALE:'' So, what did you say? - How'd you know it was me? - Because you're fuzzy.
OTHERFEMALE:You got me.
LEADMALE:l'll give it to you straight from the hip.
LEADMALE:l've got problems, real problems, and l need your help.
SUPFEMALE:- We'll help you.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah, we always do.
SUPFEMALE:Let it out, big guy.
SUPMALE:lt's eating you up.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Lola.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's - lt's Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:- l knew it, girl troubles.
SUPMALE:Girls are always trouble.
SUPFEMALE:Put a snake in her bed.
LEADMALE:Show some sensitivity.
SUPFEMALE:The man's got grief.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Well, see, Mindy wants me to leave, and l don't want to.
SUPFEMALE:Leave? Why would you have to leave? Well, it's kind of like You know when you put pudding in the icebox for a long time and it gets real hairy? Forget that one.
OTHERFEMALE:And don't tell Mommy and Daddy l told you that one either.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Well, l used to be one way, and now l'm something different.
LEADFEMALE:Kind of like when root beer goes flat, you know? Well, l wanna find out, well, how l was.
LEADFEMALE:- l don't understand.
OTHERMALE:- Me either.
LEADMALE:When do we eat? Not now, Stephanie.
SUPMALE:Uncle Morrie has the floor right now.
SUPMALE:Stuff it.
LEADMALE:We'll have to pluck a lot of the petals off your courtesy flower.
LEADMALE:Basically, l want to find out, well, what l was like before.
LEADMALE:We'd like to help you, Mork, but we don't know how you was.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, we just met you when you came to work here.
LEADMALE:l know.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you ask Mindy what you used to be like? Well, l did, and l can't see how anybody could be like that and not be coming in on three engines.
SUPMALE:You could find out what you were like from other people who knew you before.
LEADMALE:- You mean, like, ask my friends? - Of course.
LEADFEMALE:One person isn't an accurate sampling.
SUPMALE:Poll your friends for an in-depth profile.
SUPFEMALE:That's an excellent idea, Lola.
SUPMALE:l Can l ask you one question? Are you dating Walter Cronkite? Good Iuck, Ancient One.
LEADFEMALE:You are Mork"s onIy hope.
OTHERMALE:Well, how do you like the place? Did you catch the sign out front? DaVinci's.
LEADMALE:l named it for us.
SUPFEMALE:- Tell them your new slogan, Remo.
LEADFEMALE:- Sure, sis.
SUPMALE:DaVinci's Restaurant: Have your last supper here.
LEADFEMALE:- That's really artful.
LEADMALE:- Thanks.
LEADMALE:- Where do you get those ideas? - Yeah, well.
OTHERFEMALE:l have a problem.
LEADMALE:l'm taking a little opinion poll.
LEADMALE:Do you remember what l was like before? You don't wanna know that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, l always thought you were fun, kind of unpredictable, silly.
LEADMALE:- Goofy.
LEADFEMALE:- Remo.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, l meant nice goofy.
LEADMALE:Oh, l see.
LEADFEMALE:Goofy with a side of nice.
OTHERFEMALE:- A little restaurant humour.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Nelson.
OTHERFEMALE:Table for one? Well, actually, l'm supposed to meet a friend here, the Widow Comstock.
LEADFEMALE:A woman in black? She was sitting right here.
LEADFEMALE:- l think she's in the washroom.
LEADFEMALE:- That's her, poor thing.
OTHERFEMALE:She misses her late husband so very much.
LEADMALE:- She's in mourning.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:l've got a woman weeping in my new bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:Nelson, can you help a friend in need? Sure, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Come, let us sit together.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Nelson, l'd like to get back to my former self.
LEADMALE:l mean, the way l was.
LEADFEMALE:l mean, you did it.
LEADMALE:- What's the secret? - l had to.
SUPFEMALE:Losing that election showed me what kind of a shallow person l was.
OTHERFEMALE:So l joined this group that's teaching me to think positive and feel good about myself.
SUPMALE:Oh, Nelson, here l am.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, l'd like you to meet the Widow Comstock.
SUPFEMALE:- Hi, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Hi, Wid.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's cute.
LEADMALE:Nobody's ever called me Wid before.
LEADFEMALE:But then, l've only had the title for a few months.
SUPFEMALE:You see, we were assigned to each other from the group.
LEADMALE:Kind of like the buddy system.
LEADMALE:She reminds me to think positive, and l remind her not to feel grief.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, l see.
SUPFEMALE:You buoy up the girl.
LEADMALE:Nelson has given me the moral strength to go on after my husband, Randolph Yes, yes, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Nelson.
LEADMALE:lt's been a tortured four months.
LEADFEMALE:But Randolph made me promise that if he ever went before me, l would never lose that special sparkle he cherished so much.
LEADFEMALE:The skiing, the sailing, the mariachis at midnight.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter? Your face.
SUPFEMALE:There's something about it that reminds me of Randolph.
LEADMALE:Oh, is this one better? Oh, l don't mind being reminded.
LEADFEMALE:ln fact, every day, l wear black in memory of him.
LEADFEMALE:- That's why l'm wearing this.
SUPMALE:- Was that one of his? Mork, this brave woman has truly inspired me with her spontaneous vitality.
SUPMALE:You're spontaneous.
SUPMALE:That's what Mindy wants from me.
LEADFEMALE:She want-- Are you really spontaneous? Oh, l don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Nelson, let's skip dinner and dune-buggy to the border.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
SUPMALE:Let's see, we've got weird, unpredictable, goofy with a side of nice, yes.
SUPMALE:Oh, no wonder Mindy misses me.
OTHERMALE:Well, l'm gonna get ready now.
SUPFEMALE:New Mork, new Mork That's it.
OTHERMALE:l've got to tell her.
SUPMALE:New Mork, new Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork, what are you doing? - Waiting up for you, hon.
LEADMALE:- What? - Oh, nothing, titter, titter.
SUPFEMALE:l'm just being a little silly, unpredictable, wild and goofy, like my friends said l used to be.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:Here's a little goofy: Mindy, how come you only have three fingers? Mork, are you trying to--? No, no, Mindy, you haven't seen spontaneous yet.
OTHERMALE:Mind, let's take a bus all the way to Denver and have a lot of daiquiris.
LEADFEMALE:- Come on.
LEADMALE:- No, Mork.
OTHERMALE:Mork, Mork, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:Mork, this isn't you.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you see? You're being too obvious.
LEADMALE:- lt's not gonna fool the elder.
OTHERMALE:- Yeah.
OTHERMALE:And you don't have to perform for me.
SUPMALE:l'm your friend.
OTHERFEMALE:l just wanna try to help you to find your old self.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but l guess l've run out of places to look, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:l'm just sorry l couldn't be grateful for what l had.
LEADFEMALE:l'm sorry l let it get away.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, l don't want you to be purple.
LEADFEMALE:What a strange thing to say to somebody.
SUPMALE:What's that? Either Led Zeppelin's playing nearby, or he's here.
SUPFEMALE:- The elder? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:- The Ancient One is here.
LEADMALE:- Mork, what do l say? How do l act? Just be very respectful to the old coot.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:lt's all right, remain calm, remain calm, remain calm.
LEADMALE:Stop your moving.
LEADMALE:What's happening? Mind, he's older than l thought.
SUPMALE:Your Eminence.
LEADMALE:Your Eminence, he who knows all.
LEADFEMALE:He's speaking some kind of foreign language, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- l think it's Orkan.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, of course.
LEADFEMALE:- What's he saying? - l was hoping you'd know.
LEADMALE:- Does he speak English? - l'll ask him.
LEADMALE:Do you speak English? Perhaps he didn't hear you.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
SUPFEMALE:l can speak any language l choose.
LEADMALE:Mork, l don't get it.
LEADMALE:You said somebody very old was coming.
SUPFEMALE:How old are you? Seven microbIeams, or in Earth years, eighty-six.
LEADFEMALE:Eighty-six? He looks like a 1 0-year-old kid.
SUPFEMALE:On Ork, the aging process is reversed.
OTHERFEMALE:lt's kind of like Dick Clark.
SUPFEMALE:You see, we are born in a test-tube, fully grown, grey-haired and wrinkled.
OTHERFEMALE:That way, we are treated with respect from day one.
SUPMALE:And baby-shoe bronzing is really expensive.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, as we grow older, we start to look younger.
OTHERMALE:We get smaller and cuter.
SUPMALE:And that way, all the people wanna keep their old folks at home.
OTHERFEMALE:- That's nice.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
SUPMALE:ln a weird sort of way.
LEADMALE:- Let's get on with the training.
LEADMALE:- Oh, all right.
LEADFEMALE:According to the metre, you're only 1 7 percent Orkan.
LEADMALE:Mork, if you are not a full Orkan by the time l am finished here, you will be ostracised.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:The disgrace, the shame and the shande of it all.
LEADFEMALE:To be purple.
SUPMALE:To be purple in winter too.
LEADFEMALE:Purple doesn't go well with goose bumps.
LEADFEMALE:ls there anything l can do to help? You've done enough, culture sapper.
SUPMALE:- Go away.
SUPMALE:- What? Wait a minute, buster, this is my house.
LEADFEMALE:- Who do you think you are? - My name is: - l beg your pardon? - l think he said his name was: - What a rude planet.
SUPFEMALE:- You turned him into an Earthling.
LEADMALE:Now, leave us alone so l can put the Ork back in Mork.
LEADMALE:- She meant no harm, Your Eminence.
LEADFEMALE:- She robbed us of an Orkan.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, he's right.
SUPMALE:l guess l have done enough already.
LEADMALE:l'll just go back and wait in the room.
LEADMALE:Good luck.
SUPFEMALE:- Big kiss.
OTHERMALE:- Not now.
SUPMALE:- l feel really bad for her, sir.
LEADFEMALE:- Orkans do not have feelings, infidel.
SUPMALE:Now, we shall begin with something basic.
SUPFEMALE:- Hit your head against that wall.
LEADMALE:- Right.
SUPMALE:l do not know any Libyans, and l have not yet cashed the cheques.
OTHERMALE:- How did l do? - lncorrect.
LEADMALE:You did not say ""shazbot.
LEADFEMALE:"" Again.
SUPMALE:Howard, l lost.
SUPFEMALE:lt was my thyroid.
OTHERMALE:Wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Pain first, ""shazbot"" second.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:l can see why you're the elder.
LEADFEMALE:Again.
LEADFEMALE:Let's move Laverne and ShirIey to Thursday night, okay? Try it again.
LEADFEMALE:You mean there's really another Orkan up there? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dad, it's crazy.
SUPMALE:They've been unloading a whole fleet of cargo eggs and taking strange-looking stuff into the attic.
LEADMALE:You're living with two Orkans? Oh, Dad, if Mork fails his Orkan training, l'll never forgive myself.
OTHERFEMALE:He'll make it, honey.
LEADMALE:He's doing it for you.
OTHERFEMALE:You watch.
LEADFEMALE:Soon he'll be the same fella who used to lie on the lawn, shampooing caterpillars.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, l just feel so helpless.
LEADMALE:l mean, he's going through so much, and l can't even be up there with him.
OTHERMALE:- Why not? - Because that old coot won't let me.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, honey, if Mork needs you, maybe you should be up there to help him.
OTHERMALE:Well, yeah.
LEADMALE:But l feel like an intruder in my own house.
LEADFEMALE:And who knows what's even arriving in those eggs? You sound like you're a little scared.
LEADMALE:l am, but l'm scared for Mork, not for me.
LEADFEMALE:l mean, he just might fail that test.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it never hurts to bring an apple to the teacher, if you know what l mean.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:lf you want me to, l'll go up there with you.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No, thanks, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:He's my alien.
OTHERMALE:- Are you sure? - Yeah, l'm sure.
SUPMALE:Okay, well, l guess l can go, then.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Now, look, if you need me, l'll be home hiding under the bed.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:Stop.
LEADMALE:lt's a pure Orkan environment up there, and you're not going to spoil it.
LEADFEMALE:Listen: See, you and l have gotta have a little talk.
LEADFEMALE:Now, l care about Mork, and l want him to be Orkan again just as badly as you do.
LEADMALE:l mean, l think Orkans are great.
LEADMALE:They're terrific.
SUPMALE:But you just gotta let me help him.
LEADFEMALE:Do you understand? - Pardon me.
LEADFEMALE:- l can't take this excitement.
SUPFEMALE:l'm not a young man anymore.
SUPFEMALE:- All right, you may go.
LEADFEMALE:- Thank you.
LEADMALE:But you must not contaminate what we have up there with your Earthliness.
SUPFEMALE:Put this on.
LEADFEMALE:- ls this gonna fit me? - One size fits all.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, l'll be back there, putting it on.
SUPFEMALE:Up the stairs, down the stairs.
LEADMALE:This planet's rough on old people.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hello.
LEADFEMALE:You must be one of Mork's little friends from the daycare centre.
LEADMALE:What's your name? Listen, you little Leave here at once.
LEADFEMALE:This is no place for children.
SUPFEMALE:- What are you, a wise guy? - Very.
SUPFEMALE:How would you like to go for a ride in my Cuisinart? How do l look? Hi, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, l came up here to complain about the noise.
LEADFEMALE:Can't you play dress-up a little more quietly? Where'd you get your outfits? Frederick's of Mars? They're cute at that age.
LEADMALE:Let us go.
LEADMALE:But l must warn you, your upper level has been transformed into a world no Earthling has ever seen before.
LEADMALE:What's happening, my man? Looking good.
LEADFEMALE:- l don't believe this place.
LEADMALE:- Quiet.
SUPFEMALE:He's on the na-no machine.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Hi, Mind.
LEADMALE:Wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Big na-no, Mind.
SUPMALE:He's firm, but he's fair.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you look good in Orkan threads.
OTHERMALE:l didn't know they made them in cadet.
LEADFEMALE:What's happened to this place? You'd never even know we were in the attic.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, gribIitch means he's on a break, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Those elders have a tough union.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let me show you around.
SUPFEMALE:- Wow, it's really fantastic.
SUPMALE:- Shucks.
LEADFEMALE:What's that? What's that thing? That was Orkan words of wisdom.
LEADMALE:lt'll come around again.
LEADMALE:See, here it says: Which means, ''Life is like a Kusshhbaya.
LEADMALE:"" - Deep, huh? - Yeah, l'll bet.
LEADMALE:Let me show you a picture of where l grew up.
LEADFEMALE:You mean this is what Ork looks like? Well, some of it.
OTHERMALE:They tore most of it down to make swamps when they found out earthquakes were an allergic reaction to condominiums.
OTHERMALE:lt's even prettier in the fall.
LEADMALE:lt comes so quickly too.
LEADMALE:You too.
SUPFEMALE:There it goes.
OTHERFEMALE:- That is amazing.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, the artist is really fantastic.
LEADMALE:You should see one of his sunsets.
LEADFEMALE:Here comes one now.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at that.
SUPMALE:Listen, Mind.
LEADMALE:Crickets.
LEADFEMALE:Those are the three moons of Ork: Lumpy, Squeezy and Jo-Jo.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, are all these things helping you to become more Ork-like? Oh, they sure are.
LEADFEMALE:They all remind me of things back home, especially my pet noggachomp.
LEADFEMALE:Well, noggachomps are the number-one pet on Ork, even more popular than cocker frenkIes.
LEADMALE:Mine's the cutest little one of all.
SUPFEMALE:Here, let me call him.
LEADMALE:Bebo, come here, boy.
LEADMALE:Come here, Bebo.
LEADFEMALE:- l think he likes you, Mind.
LEADMALE:- Yeah, as a friend or a munchy? No, don't worry, hon.
LEADMALE:They only eat hair and rugs.
LEADFEMALE:That's why political candidates on Ork have to be real careful.
OTHERFEMALE:- Well, call him off.
SUPMALE:- Oh, okay.
SUPFEMALE:Here, Bebo.
SUPFEMALE:l don't know whether he's coming or going most times.
LEADFEMALE:He's gonna dance with me.
SUPMALE:l missed you, boy, l missed you.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, it's a boy? - l don't know.
LEADMALE:l've never had the nerve to turn him over.
LEADMALE:Yes, Your Eminence? Break's over, Mind.
LEADMALE:Take a hike, Bebo.
SUPFEMALE:- Next phase.
LEADFEMALE:- Sir.
LEADMALE:You will relearn your Orkan pledge of allegiance.
LEADMALE:Put your hand over your hearts.
LEADFEMALE:l pledge allegiance to my planet.
SUPMALE:The rest of the known universe can can it.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- What's happening? - What's happening? - What was that? Killer Naugahyde.
SUPMALE:We call it the sizzler.
LEADMALE:lt probably thought you were a Malibu chicken.
LEADFEMALE:lt was really hot.
LEADFEMALE:- lt was like it was trying to fry me.
SUPFEMALE:- That's all right.
SUPMALE:You can only sit down if you have asbestos shorts.
LEADFEMALE:- You're safe now, though, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:- Get away from him.
SUPFEMALE:But she needs me, sir.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, wait a minute, you don't under-- Mind? Mind? She checked out and took the baggage too.
SUPMALE:You froze her.
SUPFEMALE:You're more concerned about her than you are about being an Orkan.
LEADMALE:lt's no use.
SUPFEMALE:Your training can't help you.
SUPMALE:You're going back to Ork now.
LEADMALE:- No, sir, l can't leave Mind.
SUPFEMALE:- You must.
LEADFEMALE:After all these years, you'll never know that l said goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Big kiss.
LEADMALE:No, sir, l can't leave Mind.
LEADFEMALE:We'll build you another one, a more advanced model with a power seat.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, sir.
LEADFEMALE:See, there will never be another Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:You underestimate technology.
LEADMALE:We must go.
OTHERFEMALE:No, sir, you don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy's-- Blasphemy.
LEADMALE:An elder understands everything.
LEADFEMALE:You young people have no respect.
LEADFEMALE:l meant no disrespect, Your Fogyness.
SUPMALE:lf l can only show you what a Mindy is, l'll kiss your tiny feet through your sensible boots.
SUPMALE:All right, but be quick about it.
LEADFEMALE:See what's different is that she has qualities that we Orkans don't have.
LEADMALE:Sometimes she's happy.
LEADFEMALE:- Sometimes she's sad.
SUPMALE:- Mork.
OTHERMALE:Sometimes she's fun-loving.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you kid.
LEADMALE:Sometimes she's inquisitive.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, how did you get your tongue through the keyhole? But most of the time, she's caring.
SUPMALE:She's caring.
LEADFEMALE:She's really caring.
LEADMALE:- ls something stuck? - Yes, sir.
LEADMALE:Me on Mindy.
LEADMALE:Strange concept, yet it has such a hold on you.
SUPMALE:Well, sir, you see, that's why l've got to be an Orkan, sir, so l can stay here with her.
LEADMALE:l mean, she means more to me than anything in the known universe.
LEADFEMALE:l mean, is there anything we can do? There must be something.
LEADMALE:Well, there is.
OTHERFEMALE:No, it's far too dangerous.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sir, l'll risk anything.
LEADFEMALE:l'd even shave with a live weasel.
SUPFEMALE:l haven't done it in many bIeams.
SUPMALE:lt's horrendous.
LEADMALE:lt's terrifying, a last resort.
LEADMALE:l'm too old even to consider it.
LEADMALE:But maybe with her help - What happened? - With her help, l can possibly do it.
SUPFEMALE:Do what? There's a remote possibility that l might be able to pull the Earth spirits from your body with the Ritual of the Sacred Eggs.
SUPMALE:The Ritual of the Sacred Eggs, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, gasp, choke.
LEADMALE:Extreme fear.
LEADMALE:Everything pulses through my body.
SUPMALE:Mind, he's an ''eggsorcist.
LEADMALE:'' With this ceremonial egg, l will attempt to remove the Earth spirits from his body.
LEADFEMALE:- l only hope l'm strong enough.
LEADFEMALE:- Why? What's gonna happen? lt's not going to be pleasant.
LEADMALE:Wouldn't you feel more powerful if you were upstairs, in your own environment? No, we must fight the Earth vibrations off where they're most powerful.
SUPMALE:That's why it's so dangerous.
SUPFEMALE:Earth behaviour, begone.
SUPMALE:- Oh, Mork, are you all right? - Mork's not here right now.
LEADMALE:Morrie's the name, Earth creature's the game.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you mean, my credit's no good, Lord? Your grandma writes bad cheques at Macy's.
LEADMALE:The Earth spirits won't let go of him.
LEADFEMALE:l must try harder.
LEADMALE:- Begone.
LEADFEMALE:- Get that thing away from me.
SUPMALE:The next time you get that near me, there'd better be pantyhose in there.
LEADMALE:Why? What are you doing? You're a gnarly little geek, aren't you? No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:Oh, for sure, for sure.
LEADFEMALE:- Begone.
LEADFEMALE:- For sure, for sure, for sure.
LEADMALE:- Begone.
LEADMALE:- Mom, get me a Twinkie.
SUPMALE:Here, kitty, kitty.
SUPFEMALE:Here, kitty, kitty.
LEADFEMALE:Here, kitty.
LEADFEMALE:There goes the kitty.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Hey, nice to be here in Vegas.
LEADMALE:Nice to be here in Vegas.
LEADMALE:Goodnight.
LEADFEMALE:l know what to say.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, are you sure? You wanna go for a ride? No, come here.
LEADMALE:l don't know, l don't care.
OTHERFEMALE:Where would this country be without this great land of ours? l don't know.
LEADFEMALE:l'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:All l want is a condominium with a view, a condominium with a view.
SUPMALE:l shall return.
LEADFEMALE:l shall return.
LEADMALE:- Begone, begone.
LEADMALE:- l shall return.
LEADFEMALE:They're just tapes, they're just tapes.
LEADMALE:Hide them, hide them, hide them.
LEADFEMALE:Auntie Em, Auntie Em.
SUPFEMALE:Well, do something.
SUPFEMALE:l can do no more.
LEADFEMALE:lt's up to him now.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, please come back.
LEADMALE:Mork? Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- My name is Mork from Ork.
LEADMALE:- He's back.
LEADMALE:The Earthly spirits seem to have left.
LEADFEMALE:Let me help you up.
LEADMALE:Are you all right? Oh, Mind, l had this horrible dream.
LEADMALE:l dreamed my head spun all the way around and l spit out Linda Blair.
LEADFEMALE:Let me help you.
LEADMALE:Let me get this off.
LEADFEMALE:Look, your hair's growing.
LEADMALE:l'm back to my roots.
OTHERFEMALE:l'm back to my-- Thank you, Your Geezerness.
LEADFEMALE:He's just the way he used to be, right? The Ork-o-metre will tell us that.
LEADMALE:There's no place like home.
LEADMALE:Only 93 percent Orkan.
LEADMALE:You failed.
OTHERFEMALE:Prepare to leave for Ork to be ostracised.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, it can't be.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mind, we cannot question the wisdom of an elder.
LEADMALE:- Can we? - No.
LEADMALE:See? Mind, something's knocked theout of: Mind, he said the ritual would be dangerous, and yet he still did it for me.
LEADFEMALE:- And you did it for me.
SUPMALE:- Oh, and you did that for him.
LEADFEMALE:You know, life would be a lot simpler if we were selfish.
LEADMALE:Let's see if we can get him to drink some juice.
LEADMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Let me, sir.
LEADFEMALE:There we go.
LEADMALE:- Oh, yeah, l forgot.
SUPFEMALE:- lt's all right.
LEADFEMALE:He's not drinking.
LEADMALE:Maybe l should fix him some soup.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, the noodles would get caught in his fingernails.
LEADMALE:Oh, good, he's drinking.
SUPMALE:- What's he saying? - lt's Orkan for: He'd like a frozen daiquiri, and what's your sign? l was about to take Mork away, and you wanted him to stay.
LEADMALE:Why did you help me? l had to.
OTHERFEMALE:You needed someone.
LEADMALE:As a wise elder, l have never uttered these words before: l don't get it.
LEADMALE:Well, it's lt's called caring, Your Eminence.
OTHERFEMALE:Strong medicine.
OTHERMALE:l think l'm beginning to realise what a Mindy is.
LEADFEMALE:Well, at least you understand that, sir.
LEADMALE:l'm ready to leave now.
SUPMALE:- You're not a perfect Orkan.
LEADMALE:- Spare me.
OTHERFEMALE:And the rules say l must take you back.
LEADFEMALE:- Rules are rules, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:- True.
SUPFEMALE:But you are not playing the same game down here.
OTHERFEMALE:- You both taught me that.
SUPMALE:- l don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:Puzzlement, a sense of disorientation, sir.
LEADMALE:Perhaps if you were any more Orkan, you'd be of no use as an observer.
LEADMALE:- You'd stick out.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:Like me.
LEADMALE:You belong here.
OTHERFEMALE:- You mean he can stay? - Yes, oh, soft-lapped one.
LEADMALE:Thank you, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Jubilation, ''shiksalation.
SUPMALE:'' Oh, fern.
LEADMALE:Fern, l'm back.
LEADFEMALE:You too.
LEADFEMALE:Look at it.
SUPMALE:l'm back, jack.
LEADMALE:Take it easy, chair.
OTHERMALE:Sorry, sir.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Your Eminence.
LEADMALE:l liked that.
OTHERFEMALE:- That was called a hug.
SUPMALE:- lnteresting concept.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we have them on Ork? Either we're too advanced, or we don't want the Baptists to know that we're dancing.
SUPMALE:l must go now in order to catch the next time warp.
OTHERMALE:But if l should ever happen to be in the galaxy again, would you mind a visit from an old man? - Any time.
LEADFEMALE:- We promise we'll write.
LEADMALE:Yeah, as soon as we learn how to spell: Well, na-no, na-no, or as you Earthlings say: Goodbye.
SUPMALE:Well, it's nice to have you back, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Just Mindy and me And Bebo makes three Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Mork.
SUPMALE:Oh, enjoy him now, Mind.
SUPMALE:They grow to be a hundred feet high.
SUPFEMALE:He likes you, Mind.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Your Grossness, Your Fattitude, Your lnner Tubeness, oh, lard and master.
LEADMALE:- Oh, how I missed those words, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Sir, me too.
LEADMALE:GIad to see you"re back.
SUPFEMALE:l'd be glad to see your back, sir, but your front folds around and covers it.
LEADMALE:l love to zing him, Bebo.
OTHERMALE:Music to my ears.
LEADMALE:His Eminence toId me what happened.
SUPFEMALE:It must have been quite an experience for you.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, sir.
SUPFEMALE:lt was a very heavy philosophical excursion, for sure.
LEADMALE:Basically, sir, after much difficulty, l found the tree of me.
OTHERFEMALE:- Good, Mork.
SUPMALE:Where did you find it? - ln the Forest of Us, sir.
SUPFEMALE:And where is the Forest of Us? Well, down the path of change, where the squirrels of self hide the nuts of inner peace.
SUPFEMALE:In other words, Mork, what you"re saying is Iife is Iike a Kusshhbaya? Yes, sir, yes.
SUPMALE:Come on home, Mama, take anything you need.
LEADMALE:Basically, sir, l'd like to thank you, Mind, littleand everyone who made me an Orkan again, sir, because that's the way l really wanna be.
SUPMALE:- I"m gIad to hear that, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Oh, me too, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Because l learned a very important lesson.
SUPMALE:You can make your home anywhere in the universe, but it's most comfortable if you furnish it with your own traditions.
LEADMALE:And l feel best in Early Mork.
LEADMALE:Until next week, sir, na-no, na-no.
