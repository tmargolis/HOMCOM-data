SUPMALE:Nanu, nanu.
SUPMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( happy theme playing ) ( birds chirping ) Yes, Frank, I know you're the editor of the school newspaper, but I can't write this article.
LEADMALE:Because I think it's stupid.
LEADMALE:"Feminism: Myth or Myth-ith"? Okay, we will talk about it tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:It was a simple misunderstanding.
SUPMALE:What? They told me not to talk about it, but You know, I have one thing to say, right here and now: That goat was already dead.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want to hear about this.
LEADFEMALE:Smart girl.
OTHERFEMALE:It'll blow over in a year or two.
LEADMALE:( knock on door ) If anybody up there is listening, please save me from this insanity.
LEADMALE:Hi, there, curly lips.
OTHERFEMALE:No one was listening.
LEADMALE:Exidor.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
OTHERMALE:Is that you? Who wants to know? Mrs.
LEADMALE:Exidor's future husband.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:Mork.
OTHERMALE:I'm glad you dropped by.
SUPMALE:Exidor, why don't you sit down and take a load off your dock waders? All that rubber must get irritating sometimes.
LEADFEMALE:What's this I hear about a Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Exidor? Oh, Mork, I'm so excited.
LEADFEMALE:I just Pepe, you sit under me one more time, and you've sucked your last margarita.
LEADMALE:Now, then, where was I? Ah, yes.
LEADMALE:Her name is Ambrosia Malspar.
OTHERFEMALE:Of the Hogsbreath Gulch Malspars.
SUPMALE:Oh, I've heard of them.
OTHERMALE:I thought they were all caught.
SUPFEMALE:From the moment we met, I heard bells.
LEADMALE:Oh, she's a prizefighter, eh? A romantic, you're not.
OTHERMALE:I dropped by so I could invite you two to dinner tonight so you can meet Ambrosia.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you free? Uh, I don't think that we could Oh, of course we are.
LEADMALE:( whispers ) Mork, I don't care to meet an invisible fiancÃ©e.
OTHERMALE:Mindy, how long could it take? Where should we meet? Here.
LEADFEMALE:Say, about 8? You're picking us up? No, no, no.
OTHERMALE:We'll eat here.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, that's real convenient, Min.
SUPMALE:We don't have to make reservations.
LEADMALE:You expect me I'm supposed to Oh, please, don't worry about feeding Pepe.
LEADFEMALE:Tonight's his jai alai tournament.
SUPFEMALE:Ha, ha, ha.
SUPMALE:( door closes ) Mind, I'm real proud of you.
OTHERMALE:I know sometimes you think that Exidor is a twit, but yet you overcame your hang-ups, and you invited he and his fiancÃ©e over here for dinner.
SUPMALE:You're a credit to shiksadom.
LEADMALE:Mork Min? Stuff it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sensing a lot of hostility, Min.
LEADFEMALE:What's bothering and tickling your little innards? What's up? Okay you, Exidor, and Ambrosia.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, good, I'm glad you got that off your chest.
LEADMALE:Now, did you make that clam dip? I'm not finished yet.
OTHERMALE:EstÃ¡ mÃ¡s? Mas, mas more.
SUPFEMALE:I resent Exidor inviting himself for dinner, almost as much as I resent having to cook dinner for an invisible fiancÃ©e.
OTHERMALE:I mean, we're into the foothills of kinky here.
OTHERMALE:Have you ever considered that Exidor's fiancÃ©e might be a real flesh-and-blood woman? No.
SUPFEMALE:Me neither.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mind, I mean, Exidor means well.
LEADMALE:If this will make him happy, let him have his moment.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, people in robes have so few.
SUPMALE:( knock on door ) The lovebirds are here right now.
SUPMALE:We'll be right with you, loverisms.
OTHERMALE:Mind, I want you to be nice to Exidor, and try not to stare at Ambrosia.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, it's Exidor.
SUPMALE:And guess who's with him.
OTHERFEMALE:You must be Ambrosia.
LEADMALE:You're you're everything I imagined.
LEADMALE:I like your dress.
OTHERFEMALE:Who are you talking to? I'm talking to the lovely Ambrosia.
SUPMALE:But there's nobody there.
LEADFEMALE:I think the little lady has been smoking her braids again.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you don't see anybody here, do you? Not me.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot.
OTHERMALE:Now he thinks I'm the one that's crazy? Oh, I didn't say that.
SUPFEMALE:I just said your oil wasn't touching the dipstick.
SUPFEMALE:Did you or did you not state that you were bringing your fiancÃ©e here to dinner tonight? Methinks I hear her dainty step upon the stair.
LEADMALE:And this is my beloved All right, that's it.
LEADMALE:The party is over.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, I'm sorry I missed it.
OTHERMALE:Mork, Mindy I would like you to meet Ambrosia Malspar.
LEADMALE:( loudly ) She's over here, Min.
LEADFEMALE:I see her.
LEADFEMALE:May I sit down? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, sure.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:It's about time.
OTHERFEMALE:Be gentle with her.
LEADMALE:She could use a little Hamburger Helper.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:Your kind of problem doesn't carry the stigma it used to.
LEADMALE:Stigma? So, Mork, you're Exidor's best friend.
OTHERMALE:Tell me about yourself.
SUPMALE:Well, I guess you can kind of call me a son of a black hole.
OTHERMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:I'm, well, you know, my mom was a Petri dish, my dad was an eyedropper.
LEADMALE:Heh.
OTHERFEMALE:Kind of a cosmic clone.
SUPFEMALE:Just to double-check Mindy's the one with the problems? So, how did you two lovebirds meet? She chalked me.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me? Oh, this must be something of the new sexual revolution.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:You see, I'm a meter maid, and I was just minding my own business, just riding on my motor scooter, chalking tires, and Exy was lying on his back in the street fixing his burro.
LEADFEMALE:I bet the hard part was jacking him up, right? And I accidentally chalked his boots.
LEADMALE:Oh, um, why don't we all have some, uh, cheese hors d'oeuvres before dinner? Tell you what.
SUPFEMALE:I'll take the d'oeuvres.
OTHERMALE:Ar, ar.
SUPFEMALE:You two take your time.
LEADFEMALE:Amby and I will just sit here and make little fishy faces at one another.
SUPFEMALE:I just can't get over it.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, she's real, and she seems perfectly normal.
LEADMALE:Unless she's a hologram.
SUPFEMALE:Look at her.
LEADMALE:She she's nice, she's charming, and she's sane.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, she's nothing like Exidor.
OTHERMALE:I'll bet she's gonna be good for him.
LEADMALE:Look, even tonight, he's acting relatively normal.
LEADMALE:( shouting ) Stop that pounding.
SUPFEMALE:We're not deaf.
LEADMALE:Hold that thought.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Stop that pounding.
LEADMALE:I'm coming.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing here? Who is it, sweetheart? It's Pepe.
LEADFEMALE:It's Pepe? Looks like Pepe to me.
SUPFEMALE:No, it can't be Pepe.
LEADMALE:Pepe's playing jai alai tonight.
LEADFEMALE:What am I saying? Exidor, it can't be Pepe.
LEADMALE:Mork, Mindy, I know you're trying to protect Exidor, but it's as plain as the nose on your face what's going on, especially when Pepe's standing right there.
SUPMALE:BOTH: He is? Exidor, you promised me Pepe wouldn't be here tonight.
LEADFEMALE:But, guppy lips Why can't we ever be alone? Why does he always have to tag along? You said you wanted to light my fire, but three on a match is too much.
LEADFEMALE:But, flamingo toes.
LEADMALE:Pepe, you stay right here.
LEADMALE:Don't you dare follow us.
SUPMALE:I don't want to talk about it.
LEADMALE:I'm going to bed for a week.
LEADMALE:( comedic theme playing ) ( mouthing words ) ( knock on door ) Who is it? Oh, he's in muscatel heaven.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for the ride, boys.
LEADMALE:Come on in, Exidor.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you sit down? What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong.
LEADMALE:Ambrosia dumped me.
LEADFEMALE:She said she wouldn't marry me if I was the last prophet on earth, which I am.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'm sorry to hear about that.
SUPMALE:One day you'll meet a girl right for you in every way.
LEADMALE:Do you really think so? No, but at least you had hope for a moment.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Mork.
LEADMALE:I just dropped by to say adios.
LEADFEMALE:I'm shuffling off this mortal coil, and I want you to have all my worldly possessions.
LEADMALE:Here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:That's won It's empty.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course.
LEADMALE:That suitcase is all my worldly possessions.
OTHERFEMALE:Except for a large rock, and I'm saving that for transportation.
LEADFEMALE:You're saving a rock for transportation? Yes.
LEADMALE:I'm going to tie it to my leg when I go on vacation.
SUPMALE:In Atlantis.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on now, Exidor.
OTHERMALE:You're not going anywhere.
SUPMALE:You're gonna spend the night here.
LEADMALE:And I guarantee, tomorrow morning, things will look a lot better.
OTHERFEMALE:But what if they don't? Well, you'll have to stay here until they do, that may take forever, that's all right.
LEADMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Min.
OTHERFEMALE:It's settled.
SUPMALE:Here we go, Exidor.
LEADMALE:Time to hit the sack.
LEADMALE:A little mondo do-do.
LEADMALE:Here we go.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, this is very kind of you both.
SUPMALE:You won't even know I'm here.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:( howling ) Mork, he's baying.
LEADMALE:Of course, Min, it's a full moon.
LEADFEMALE:( howls ) ( dramatic theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) So, then what happens, the alpha says to the beta, "The muzzle, take it off.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna kiss her.
LEADMALE:" The alpha said, "why, are we nailed to a chicken?" ( laughs ) Ar, ar, ar.
OTHERMALE:That's wildly hysterical, Mork, but I'm empty.
SUPFEMALE:My life is over.
SUPMALE:I'm going out and kiss my burro goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, you can't do that.
LEADMALE:Where is the old Exidor spirit? Locked up in Ambrosia's cold, cold heart.
LEADFEMALE:Will you kindly take your boots off my sofa? Whoa, whoa, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:He's got squatter's rights.
SUPFEMALE:You gotta show some compassion, this man's on the ragged edge.
LEADMALE:If you two don't mind, I think I'll take a little hike upstairs to Mork's lake.
LEADFEMALE:The leaves are changing, you know? They just drop off, shrivel up, and die.
SUPFEMALE:It's hard to keep from laughing.
LEADMALE:That is it, Mork.
SUPMALE:He's gotta go or I'm gonna end up as looney tunes as he is.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mind, you gotta help him.
SUPMALE:You can't discard him like an old Carter cabinet member.
LEADMALE:You're right, I can't.
LEADMALE:But I can try to get Ambrosia to take him back.
SUPFEMALE:( melodramatic theme playing ) ( birds chirping ) Oh, come on, Ambrosia, why don't you tell me why you really broke up with Exidor.
SUPMALE:I'd rather not discuss it, Mindy.
OTHERMALE:Well, you shouldn't just let him go.
SUPFEMALE:Exidor is a very unique person.
LEADMALE:I mean, when they dropped Exidor, they broke the mold.
OTHERMALE:They sure did.
LEADMALE:He's kind, considerate, a snappy dresser.
LEADMALE:And let's not forget that swell sense of humor.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, why did you break up with him? Well It's that friend of his, Pepe.
SUPFEMALE:He won't leave us alone.
LEADFEMALE:We go to the swap meet, there's Pepe.
OTHERMALE:We go skateboarding, there's Pepe.
LEADMALE:Tailgating.
LEADMALE:Sometimes I wish he'd just disappear.
LEADFEMALE:Um What what exactly does Pepe look like? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:You'd have to ask Exidor.
LEADFEMALE:Then, you know that Pepe doesn't exist? Well, I wouldn't say that.
LEADFEMALE:A lot of people believe in men from outer space.
LEADMALE:I've never seen one, but that doesn't mean they don't exist.
LEADMALE:Good point.
LEADFEMALE:Exidor sees Pepe, and he's never lied to me yet.
SUPMALE:Besides, you have to believe in the man you love.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you're a very special person, Ambrosia.
SUPMALE:No, I'm not, because I haven't been totally honest with you or Exidor.
SUPFEMALE:Pepe isn't the real problem.
OTHERMALE:He's not? No.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm old-fashioned.
OTHERFEMALE:Before a couple gets married, I believe the man should ask the woman to marry him.
LEADMALE:Well, what if Exidor did propose to you? Would you marry him then? No.
SUPFEMALE:Why not? Mindy he's never told me he loves me.
LEADMALE:( tender theme playing ) What are you doing? Isn't it obvious? I'm drowning in your lake.
SUPMALE:Now get out of here and let me sink in peace.
LEADFEMALE:But I've got great news.
OTHERMALE:Ambrosia wants you back.
LEADMALE:Ambrosia wants me back? Save me.
OTHERMALE:Save me.
SUPFEMALE:Wait.
SUPFEMALE:Wait.
OTHERFEMALE:You can't.
SUPFEMALE:You'll drown.
LEADFEMALE:What do I do? Quick, grab my dinghy.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Just tread rug.
SUPMALE:I'll be right there.
LEADMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:A life preserver.
LEADMALE:Hold onto that.
LEADMALE:( imitating motor ) Hurry.
LEADFEMALE:Hurry.
LEADMALE:A grouper's got me by the leg.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:( grunts ) Whoa.
LEADMALE:Plucked from a watery grave.
LEADMALE:Tell me, when can I see my fox? Well, she's coming tonight, you have to do is one thing, and she'll take you back.
LEADFEMALE:Anything.
SUPMALE:Name it.
LEADFEMALE:All you have to do is say.
LEADMALE:"I love you.
SUPMALE:Will you marry me?" That's it, back to catfish country.
LEADMALE:No, no, wait, wait.
OTHERMALE:I thought you loved Ambrosia.
LEADMALE:I do.
LEADFEMALE:Then why can't you tell her? Mork, this may come as a bit of a surprise, but I am just a little eccentric.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:You see, Mork, I just can't get myself to say that phrase.
LEADMALE:In the orphanage where I was raised, nobody ever said it to me.
LEADMALE:You've got to.
SUPFEMALE:It's for your own happiness.
LEADMALE:But you don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:It's a psychological problem.
LEADMALE:Everyone's allowed one little hang-up.
OTHERMALE:( doorbell rings ) There she is.
SUPMALE:I can't say it.
LEADMALE:If you don't, you're gonna lose her.
SUPMALE:Now, remember: "I love you.
SUPMALE:" That's really nice, but what are we gonna do about Ambrosia? ( doorbell rings ) Hi, Ambrosia.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:EXIDOR: Let me go.
SUPMALE:I can't.
LEADMALE:No, don't grab me there.
LEADMALE:Is Exidor here? Um, I don't know.
SUPMALE:I'll check.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
SUPFEMALE:We have company.
SUPFEMALE:MORK: Mind.
LEADMALE:Be right down.
LEADMALE:Get down there.
OTHERMALE:( crashing ) I think that they're probably freshening up a bit.
LEADMALE:Exy won't go anywhere unless he's just so.
LEADFEMALE:EXIDOR: No, I won't go.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, there, dimple hips.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Exy.
LEADFEMALE:Does Exidor have something he wants to say to Ambrosia? Do you have something you want to say to Ambrosia? Can't think of anything.
OTHERMALE:Think again.
LEADMALE:You can do it.
SUPMALE:Ihave something I want to say.
OTHERMALE:I I It's impossible, I can't.
LEADMALE:My life is over.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I got a good idea.
SUPMALE:Let's play charades.
OTHERMALE:Charades? Well, you see, Exidor has trouble communicating with h-e-r.
LEADFEMALE:I love to play charades.
LEADMALE:Exidor, you be the giver.
OTHERMALE:You be the receiver.
SUPFEMALE:Exidor, go.
SUPFEMALE:Hit it.
SUPFEMALE:Uh Uh First word.
LEADFEMALE:First word.
LEADFEMALE:BOTH: Eye.
LEADMALE:I got it.
LEADFEMALE:"I love you, and will you marry me?" I thought she'd never get it.
OTHERFEMALE:The answer is, "I love you too, and you bet.
LEADFEMALE:" Oh, I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:She loves me.
LEADMALE:Exy, will you walk me home, alone? Just a moment.
SUPMALE:Pepe.
LEADFEMALE:Them wedding bells have broken up that old gang of ours.
LEADFEMALE:Hasta luego, amigo.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:You're too good to me.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd do anything for you because I love you, and I want to marry you.
LEADMALE:( upbeat wedding theme playing ) Twice in one night.
LEADFEMALE:And there's a lot more where that came from.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it took the both of us, but we pulled it off.
OTHERMALE:Hey, how about going to the deli with me? I'll buy you a soda.
SUPMALE:I still feel kind of strange about one thing.
SUPFEMALE:What? Well, I feel kind of sorry for Pepe.
LEADMALE:I mean, where's he gonna get work with an invisible green card? ( upbeat theme playing ) ( magical theme playing ) Mork calling Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Come in, great super scooper in the sky.
SUPFEMALE:ORSON: Your report, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sir, I am so excited.
OTHERFEMALE:My best friend is getting married next week.
SUPFEMALE:How long do marriages on earth last? Oh, until death do they part or a quick trip to Reno, whichever comes first.
SUPMALE:But I think Exidor's marriage is gonna last forever.
OTHERMALE:Exidor? Isn't he the one you told me was strange, even by earth standards? Ah, sir, with love, there are no standards.
LEADMALE:You see, no matter how strange or bizarre you are there's always a certain someone who'll love you for it.
LEADFEMALE:Love gives everyone a chance to be happy.
LEADFEMALE:Chance? You make it sound like a lottery.
LEADFEMALE:Well, sir, in a way, love is a lottery.
LEADFEMALE:And the only losers are the ones who won't gamble.
OTHERFEMALE:Exidor's marriage promises to be one of the most unusual in the history of mankind.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be late, and don't come empty-handed.
LEADMALE:Nanu, nanu.
