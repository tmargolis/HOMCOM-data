LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Oh, hello, dear.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you ready? Well, I want you to know that I am not looking forward to this weekend.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm with you.
SUPMALE:I'd rather have my nose pierced.
LEADMALE:I agree, but it's an obligation.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, I haven't even told Mork yet.
LEADMALE:I feel so bad about running off and leaving him stranded for the whole weekend.
LEADMALE:It's a long way to Alpha Centauri ( loud beep ) Yep.
SUPMALE:It's me, the Doug Henning of the skycaps.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:Let's take off.
SUPFEMALE:Let's move it.
SUPFEMALE:Come on now.
LEADMALE:Hit the road, Jack Don't come back no more, no more.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Mork, uh, Durango is a long, unpleasant drive from here.
LEADMALE:Now you don't want to go there, do you? My kind of town Durango is my No, no, Mork, no, it's a windy, twisty, carsicky trip.
LEADFEMALE:You wouldn't like it.
SUPMALE:Are you kidding? I'll love it.
LEADMALE:It's my first car trip here on Earth.
SUPMALE:Please, you know, I stayed up all last night and look, I have my instamatic glove and I have a whole thumb load full of film.
SUPMALE:Since I heard you were taking a trip to Durango last night I'm sorry I eavesdropped, but since Watergate, anything's free.
SUPMALE:Look, I made plans.
SUPFEMALE:I bought these silly clothes.
LEADFEMALE:I even made a map.
OTHERMALE:See this.
SUPFEMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:It's topographical and scratch-and-smell.
SUPFEMALE:There's L.
LEADFEMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE:Whoo, bad news.
SUPFEMALE:Over here look at this.
LEADMALE:We'll start out from Boulder then we'll go a little bit out of the way to the Grand Canyon, ( echoes ): canyon, canyon We'll go over here to New York.
SUPFEMALE:We'll spend autumn in New York.
SUPFEMALE:Then we'll drive over to Paris, spend spring in Paris, watch the leaves change, then we'll go to Iran and watch the governments change.
LEADMALE:Mork.
OTHERMALE:Shah, shah, Ayatollah you so.
LEADMALE:Shah-shah Mork you can't go.
LEADMALE:Do my eyes deceive my ears? Wait, you must be pulling my krebits.
OTHERMALE:Mork, it's a family problem.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Jack is sick.
SUPMALE:A drunken mime? No, believe me, you don't want to go.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Jack is a little strange.
LEADMALE:I've never liked him since he spit on me.
SUPMALE:Why did he do that? Well, it was years ago.
SUPFEMALE:I had his tie.
LEADMALE:What were you doing with his tie? Well, I was pulling it, tighter and tighter.
LEADMALE:I had him a lovely shade of purple.
LEADFEMALE:FRED: He had it coming.
LEADMALE:He was drunk.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:See, it's a sickness and he wants to get better, so he checked himself into a hospital.
SUPFEMALE:His wife asked us to come down and give him a little moral support.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, so now that we've explained, do you understand? Hey, listen, you're talking to Mork the Compassionate.
LEADFEMALE:I was almost a saint.
LEADMALE:Tell you what, we'll leave out the Grand Canyon.
LEADFEMALE:That way, we can be with Uncle Jack by Happy Hour.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you can't go.
SUPFEMALE:Really, it's just a family matter.
LEADMALE:Anyway, he'd be embarrassed to have a perfect stranger see him like this.
LEADFEMALE:That's all right.
OTHERMALE:I'm a sensitive life-form.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not some Venusian paramecium that was evolved yesterday, you know.
OTHERFEMALE:( fake chuckle ) You'll be all right here alone for the weekend, won't you? Sure, sure, why wouldn't I? Well, you haven't been alone for any period of time since you've been here.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mindy, let me lay out some hard, cold facts.
SUPMALE:I'm the type of guy who's my own best friend.
OTHERMALE:I'm interesting, I'm amazing.
OTHERMALE:I can hold interesting conversations even with Tom Snyder.
LEADFEMALE:Are you ever bored when you're alone with me? No, but Neither am I.
SUPMALE:Same guy, same amazing personality.
LEADFEMALE:I think what Mindy's trying to say is, when you get used to being around somebody, it's kind of difficult when they're gone.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, we're not talking a lifetime, we're talking a weekend.
OTHERMALE:Two days.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on now, 48 hours.
LEADFEMALE:Couple of thousand minutes, some seconds there.
LEADMALE:Hey, you know, I know some Alpha Centurians that spend that much time just taking a coffee break.
SUPMALE:Of course, they drink out of hundred-gallon mugs, but You know, I think we really should be going.
LEADMALE:Good-bye, Mork.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you kids get outta here.
OTHERMALE:Come on, before I kick you out.
SUPFEMALE:Take a hike.
SUPMALE:Come on, get out.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then I'll see you Sunday night.

OTHERMALE:Have a fantastic time.
LEADMALE:And, hey, don't worry about me, because I've got thousands of things to do.
SUPMALE:I'm going to build that nuclear reactor for the hot tub you've been wanting for a long time.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Take care.
LEADMALE:All right, bye.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
OTHERFEMALE:( sighs ) I'm so stinking bored! MORK ( sings ): One more bottle of beer on the wall One more bottle of beer If one of those bottles should happen to fall One more time! A million bottles of beer on the wall A million bottles of beer If one of those I can't sing that song anymore.
OTHERMALE:Ten times is enough.
LEADFEMALE:I almost know it by heart.
LEADMALE:Let's see how many points.
OTHERMALE:Ah, only two points against me.
OTHERFEMALE:Er She's only been gone 24 hours, and I'm going crazy.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think? Hey, don't look at me like that.
SUPMALE:At least, you can do yoga.
LEADFEMALE:What can I do? Bickley's out of town.
SUPMALE:Susan Taylor's visiting the Broncos.
OTHERFEMALE:Shazbot! Ha-ha! Ha-ha! They can't fool me.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, a cure, a remedy.

LEADMALE:Hey, Bob, the reason I called What? Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, no, you don't know me.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I just picked your name out of the book.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I thought with a name like Bob Lipschultz you've got to be a fun kind of guy.
LEADFEMALE:Bob, how about you and I getting together? What? Bob? Bad connection.
LEADFEMALE:I guess it just hit me.
OTHERMALE:I didn't realize it till now that I'm a people junkie.
LEADMALE:Need a conversation fix.
LEADFEMALE:Can you spare a word, man? "No, I can't.
SUPFEMALE:" Shut up, give me a chance.
LEADFEMALE:I need a fix real bad.
LEADFEMALE:I got to talk to someone.
LEADMALE:I really do.
OTHERFEMALE:( chuckles nervously ) Yes, I do! Talk to someone.
OTHERMALE:Is there anybody? Is anybody out there? Hey, you! Yeah, changing the tire on the semi.
SUPMALE:Yeah, with the tattoo on your face.

LEADMALE:No, wait, wait, wait.
OTHERMALE:Don't! Oh, an insurance salesman.
LEADMALE:Whoa, nice throw! You can get a job in front of any American Embassy in the world.
LEADFEMALE:MAN: Hey, you two, what's all the noise? Bicky, is that you? Yeah, and I want the both of you to shut up.
SUPMALE:No, no, no, wait! Don't! ( glass breaks ) Mork, I want to talk to you.

LEADMALE:Have a nice nap.
LEADFEMALE:( knocking ) Come in.
LEADFEMALE:Bicky.
SUPMALE:Look at that.
SUPMALE:Wow, parallel universe.
LEADFEMALE:Same thing happened to me.
LEADMALE:You pea-brain.
OTHERFEMALE:What's the big idea of getting that walking tree trunk mad at you? I didn't mean to make him mad at me.
OTHERFEMALE:I just wanted to have a friend.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you're such a babe in the woods.
OTHERMALE:There are certain things you never do in this world if you want to stay in this world.
LEADFEMALE:For example, never gargle with crazy glue.
LEADMALE:( low ): Never gargle with crazy glue.
LEADFEMALE:Never tap-dance in a minefield.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:No "Tea for Two" or ( imitates explosion ) And never chide a man with a tattoo on his face even if he's dead.
LEADFEMALE:No dead tattoos.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't mean to.
LEADMALE:It was just that I was bored and lonely.
SUPFEMALE:Can't you think of a time when you were bored and lonely? I can't think of a time when I wasn't bored.
SUPFEMALE:No, I take that back.
LEADFEMALE:I was once hit by lightning.
SUPFEMALE:I wasn't bored when I was in a coma.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on, things can't always be that bad.
LEADMALE:Sure they can, kid.
OTHERFEMALE:When my wife and I got divorced, part of the settlement was that she got to keep our friends.
OTHERMALE:We'll make new friends for you.
LEADMALE:Tell you what.
LEADMALE:We'll go out tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll have a swell time.
LEADMALE:We'll paint the town pink.
SUPMALE:And do what? Well, we Oh, we can go to a movie.
LEADFEMALE:Tell you what, we'll check the listings here and see what's playing.
LEADMALE:Let's see.
LEADMALE:Oh, here's a great double bill: Born Free and Women in Chains.
SUPFEMALE:A movie? Out of the question.
SUPMALE:I never go any place where my feet stick to the floor.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Here are some self-improvement courses.
OTHERMALE:Let's see, there's a speed-reading course at the university from 8:00 to 8:05.
SUPMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:Wait! Here's an ESP course.
LEADFEMALE:Strange, it doesn't give the address.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I don't want to go to any crummy movies or scuzzy meetings.
SUPFEMALE:Well, let's see what Wait, wait, here's a wonderful thing.
SUPFEMALE:This is a restaurant.
SUPMALE:Let's see.
SUPFEMALE:"Harry's Girls and Grill.
SUPMALE:Topless, bottomless, backless, frontless.
OTHERMALE:" Doesn't sound like they give you very much to eat.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to meet anybody and I don't want to go out.
LEADMALE:Nothing you can say will make me change my mind.
SUPMALE:Wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Here's a great place.
SUPFEMALE:"Mother Bell's.
LEADMALE:Opens at 8:00.
SUPMALE:" It's just a bar.
LEADMALE:First drink's free.
LEADFEMALE:Meet me here at 7:30.
SUPMALE:( indistinct chatter ) ( phone buzzes ) ( phone buzzes ) ( piano playing "Just the Way You Are" ) Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:I knew I shouldn't have come out tonight If it hadn't been for you, I wouldn't have been in the car.
LEADMALE:And if you hadn't seen that chipmunk, I never would have swerved to avoid it.
SUPMALE:It was exciting, wasn't it? Exciting? You call taking off a parked car's door exciting? It was for the sheriff sitting in the car.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you see the look on his face "What the?" The silly fool was still trying to roll up the window and it was on its way to Cheyenne.
LEADFEMALE:What was he doing in that car anyway? He was escorting that big black limousine in front of him.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, the one we crashed into.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, the same.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it's not your fault.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, you swerved to avoid that squirrel.
LEADMALE:You tell that to any judge in the country, and he'll believe you.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ): Oh, really? What makes you think the judge would take my word over the governor's? Ah, good point.
LEADMALE:There's a yin and yang to everything.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's the yin: if that car hadn't been there, we would have gone over the cliff.
OTHERMALE:The yang was the governor's car went over the cliff.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, was he mad.
LEADFEMALE:Well, not as mad as if he'd been in the car.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Are you boys new? No, actually he's about 45, 46; I'm kind of ageless.
OTHERMALE:She means is this our first time here.
LEADFEMALE:The answer is yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it's Mother Bell's policy to buy new customers their first drink.
LEADFEMALE:Paper parasols? I didn't know we were in Little Tokyo.
LEADMALE:There's no theater like an old theater I don't want any fruity drinks.
LEADFEMALE:Bring me a bourbon and water, and hold the water.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, bring me a Shirley Temple, and hold the curls; I don't want a hair ball.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me, miss, uh, tell me, what are these telephones for? They're all over the place.
LEADMALE:To call people.
LEADFEMALE:You can call anyone in this room.
OTHERMALE:This is a very friendly place.
LEADMALE:See? I told you.
LEADFEMALE:Don't I pick good places, huh? Didn't I do well, right? You bubblehead! This isn't just a bar; it's a pickup joint.
LEADMALE:( phone buzzes ) A what? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Pick up the phone.
OTHERFEMALE:( honking bark ) Hello.
LEADMALE:Well, I don't think I have one of those.
SUPMALE:Maybe my friend does.
SUPMALE:Well, if that was true, I'd have to be eight feet tall.
LEADFEMALE:Give me that.
LEADMALE:Don't you realize this is a swinging singles bar? And that kicks it, I'm going home.
SUPMALE:No, wait! Come on, Bick.
SUPFEMALE:It's time to flick.
LEADMALE:Let's go! Listen, come on, Bickley, you said you wanted to come here because you were lonely and bored, and look at all these people.
LEADFEMALE:They must've come here 'cause they were lonely and bored.
LEADMALE:Mork, you don't understand.
OTHERMALE:I've never felt comfortable meeting people.
SUPFEMALE:I never could do it.
LEADMALE:I always felt as though I was in over my head, and right now, I feel very uncomfortable, and I'd like to go home.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Would you boys mind if we joined you? You know, I never did get my bourbon.
OTHERMALE:I'm Lisa, and this is Penny.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Oh, a Penny for my thoughts.
SUPMALE:Heads or tails.
LEADFEMALE:( honking bark ) Just watch those thoughts because this is my daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Mother and da-da- daw-daw-daw-daw a little kid.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Well, the family that plays together stays together.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:It's not like that at all.
LEADMALE:Look, Mom just got into town, and I wanted to take her out, so we came here.
LEADFEMALE:I had no idea this was a a swinger's bar.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADMALE:And, you see, what's happened is that there are two fellas over there, and they've been, um, well, you know, looking at us.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you mean those two guys that look like the history of leather.
LEADMALE:( both laughing ) Well put.
SUPMALE:Look, we figured I mean, if you fellas wouldn't mind that we'd pretend that you were our dates so they'd leave us alone.
SUPMALE:Is that okay? Well, sure, um, I guess so.
SUPMALE:My name is Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Nana-nanu.
LEADMALE:And this is Bickley.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley, would you like them to be our dates? ( stammering ): Absowubely.
LEADFEMALE:Ahb dowms Uh, uh, uh, bourbon! Uh well, uh, do you fellas come here very often? No, this is our first time.
SUPMALE:We're just kind of bored and lonely guys looking for meaningful life in this existence.
LEADFEMALE:But now you've given us some meaning, and Bickley, is this what Earth's all about? No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:This is our first time here.
LEADFEMALE:PENNY: Uh what's your sign? Ah, Nefarious, with egg rising.
SUPFEMALE:( laughing ) And, uh, where do you live? Oh, right here in Boulder.
SUPMALE:Libra.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a Libra.
LEADFEMALE:Libra.
LEADMALE:I can't believe this is happening.
SUPMALE:Neither can I.
LEADFEMALE:If the fruity drink lady comes by again, would you like us to get you something? Oh, thanks, but we've imposed enough.
LEADFEMALE:BICKLEY: Boulder.
SUPMALE:I live in Boulder.
LEADMALE:This is great! Just great! LISA: Listen, um you know those two fellas um, they're staring at us again.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa.
OTHERFEMALE:Bang-bang.
SUPMALE:Uh, those guys give me the creeps.
LEADMALE:Look, why don't we go somewhere else, and we'll buy you guys a drink.
SUPFEMALE:Good idea.
LEADMALE:Hey, that sounds fantastic.
LEADFEMALE:Anything not to be bored and lonely again.
LEADMALE:Whoa, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, why don't we buy you two girls a drink? Waitress, could we have those two freebie drinks back again? You know, the fruit- and-umbrella numbers? Boy, you can't believe what we fell into here.
LEADMALE:This is the happiest day of my life.
SUPFEMALE:Uh Scratch that.
LEADMALE:My greedy neighbor just ran off with my mother and daughter.
SUPFEMALE:( phone buzzes ) Keep it.
LEADMALE:Bick, Bick, what's keeping you? Come on, you got to get going.
OTHERFEMALE:The girls are ready to go, and you'll never guess what happened.
LEADFEMALE:They want to take us to a house.
SUPMALE:You'll never guess whose house.
OTHERMALE:Not theirs? Close.
LEADFEMALE:Yours! Oh! Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:( talking and laughing ) Oh! Will you look at this.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, isn't this nice.
LEADMALE:Yes, it's darling.
OTHERFEMALE:See? Isn't it nice to have friends over? It's wonderful! See, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Bickley's not used to having people over.
SUPMALE:Well, he's kind of a grouch, but we're trying to help him through it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, last February I almost grinned.
OTHERMALE:Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:( laughing ) Whoa Well, now that we're here, let's get down to a really good game of Parcheesi.
LEADMALE:Would you mind if we powder our nose first? Oh, gladly, but just don't use gunpowder or you'll visit your head in Utah.
SUPMALE:Thanks for the advice.
LEADMALE:( honking bark ) Where is it? It's right through there, just across from the bedroom.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Come on, honey.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that yeah, right Oh, Mork, this is impossible to believe.
SUPFEMALE:Never in my entire life have I ever picked up a girl before.
OTHERFEMALE:I was always afraid to try.
LEADMALE:But, you know, it's not so hard once you give it a try.
SUPFEMALE:All it takes is a little self-assertion.
LEADMALE:( laughs ) 'Cause, if you got it, you got it.
LEADMALE:You got it, and we want it.
OTHERMALE:What was it? What is it? A stickup.
LEADMALE:LISA: All right, Oh come on, everybody up, up, up.
SUPMALE:Hands up in the air.
SUPMALE:I don't want to have to scatter you all around the room.
SUPMALE:Can't you point that thing the other way? No.
SUPFEMALE:It wouldn't have the same impact.
SUPMALE:Now, come on, empty your pockets on the table.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Hurry up.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks a lot, Mr.
LEADMALE:Matchmaker! Well, at least we're not bored anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Miss, I hope you don't think I'm rude, but I think your mother's teaching you some bad habits.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, well, just think of it as charity.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd hardly ever donate my watch to charity.
LEADMALE:( car horn honks ) Okay, come on, that's Mark with the car.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
OTHERMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that should slow you down for a little while.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:It's been nice robbing you.
SUPMALE:Yeah, thanks for the date.
LEADFEMALE:It's been fun.
LEADMALE:( both laughing ) Shouldn't we have kissed them good night? MORK: They were so cute.
LEADMALE:MAN: Well Thanks a lot, Officer.
LEADFEMALE:I know you'll find them.
LEADFEMALE:Ciao.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Bick.
OTHERMALE:We'll get our stuff back.
LEADFEMALE:Those girls robbed three other guys in the same bar, and the police are gonna have a cookout.
LEADFEMALE:Stakeout.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I don't mind talking to a policeman for an hour this time of night, but I resent his shaking his head and giggling the whole time.
LEADMALE:Come on, it's a new wave silly cops.
LEADFEMALE:Haven't you watched CHiPs? Hi.
LEADMALE:How's Uncle Jack? Oh, I think he'll be all right.
LEADFEMALE:He just had a cork stuck in his throat.
LEADMALE:How was your weekend? Why do you ask? Well, to be perfectly honest with you, I thought that since I was gone you'd run out of things to do and be bored.
SUPMALE:Oh, me? Good-time Morky bored? We had a fantastic time.
SUPMALE:Bicky, tell her if you've got any strength left after our wild and wonderful weekend.
SUPMALE:He didn't let up all weekend.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we had a wonderful time.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, our company just left.
SUPMALE:What company? BICKLEY: Um, uh, Mork and I met a couple of girls.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we went to a gymnastics bar.
SUPMALE:It was incredible.
LEADMALE:And we met these wonderful friends.
SUPFEMALE:We'll take you there, and you can make friends, too.
LEADFEMALE:How friendly were these friends? Do we look like the kind of guys who would kiss and tell? Mindy, you should've seen the mother.
OTHERFEMALE:So beautiful.
SUPFEMALE:MINDY: Mother?! I don't think I want to hear about this.
LEADFEMALE:Then I can tell you about the daughter.
LEADMALE:You wanna hear about that, huh, maybe? I know I don't want to hear this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a little tired.
SUPMALE:I think I'm gonna go to bed.
LEADMALE:I'll talk to you about this tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Good night, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley.
OTHERMALE:Good night, Mr.
LEADMALE:Goodbar.
LEADMALE:But wait! Mindy! You'll never guess who we ran into the governor.
SUPFEMALE:Whew! Wow.
SUPMALE:You know something, Bicky? When we were going through it tonight, it was it was kind of terrifying, but telling Mindy right now, it sounded really good to me.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I agree.
LEADMALE:Maybe from a distance, we can appreciate what we've experienced better rather than when we were actually going through the trauma of having No, that's bull.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I guess people forget the fun things and only remember the exciting things.
OTHERFEMALE:We weren't bored, so we must've accomplished what we wanted to do.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Wish they hadn't robbed us, though.
LEADFEMALE:We sure have a heck of a story to tell our grandkids.
SUPMALE:Well, good night, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, Bick.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, I was thinking Saturday night? Be there or be square! There are millions of stories on this planet.
LEADMALE:This has just been one of them.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, the Incredible Bulk.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:ORSON: Did you have an interesting week, Mork? Oh, yes, sir, I met some people called "thieves.
SUPFEMALE:" Thieves? What are thieves? Well, thieves are people who steal things.
SUPMALE:First of all, there are jewel thieves, who steal precious gems and stones, there are cat burglars, who steal pets, and then the Pittsburgh Steelers, who steal entire cities.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell me Boulder, Colorado, got taken.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, sir, just me and Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley.
LEADFEMALE:We were robbed by some lady friends that Bickley said we never should've trusted to begin with.
LEADFEMALE:I thought earthlings believed in trust.
OTHERMALE:Even that dollar bill you sent me had "In God We Trust" written on it.
LEADFEMALE:Orson, you can't believe everything you read.
LEADMALE:It also said that it's worth a dollar.
SUPFEMALE:Let me understand.
SUPFEMALE:You were robbed by two friends? Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, they were pretty and soft.
LEADFEMALE:Well soft on the outside, and kind of hard on the inside.
LEADFEMALE:You mean, on Earth, your friends will rob you? Well, if they do, they're not really friends, then.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mindy's your friend.
SUPMALE:How do you know that someday she won't rob you? Well, sir, I don't think she's that kind of friend, and even if she were, she'd have to rob me thousands of times just to get back half of what she's given me.
OTHERFEMALE:So until next week.
SUPMALE:Give me an "N"! "N.
OTHERMALE:" Give me an "A"! "A.
SUPMALE:" Give me another "N"! "N.
LEADFEMALE:" Give me a big "O"! "O.
LEADMALE:" What's that spell? Nanu.
SUPFEMALE:Wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:Nano.
LEADFEMALE:See you next week, Orsoon.
LEADMALE:Nanu! Ha-ha-ha-ha! What a chump!
