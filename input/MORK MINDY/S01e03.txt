LEADFEMALE:Nanu, nanu.
OTHERMALE:Shazbot.
LEADMALE:( opening musical theme plays ) Orson calling Mork.
LEADMALE:Orson calling Mork.
LEADMALE:Come in, Mork.
LEADMALE:Orson? Is that you? Of course it's me.
LEADFEMALE:Who else has your number? Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right, I forgot.
SUPFEMALE:I've got unlisted mind.
LEADMALE:What's up, great cosmic intruder? It seems the report of your first week on Earth was accidentally destroyed.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, a likely story.
LEADMALE:Trying to pull a Nixon on me, eh? I thought all those reports were stored on micro-wire cassette.
OTHERFEMALE:They are.
LEADMALE:However, your superiors were chewing caramels and used that report to floss their teeth.
LEADMALE:Good thing Jimmy Carter wasn't there or we'd have lost the entire file.
SUPMALE:Mork Sir.
SUPMALE:I want you to activate your Orkan total recall and duplicate your report.
LEADMALE:Gotcha.
LEADMALE:Lights, camera, action! Mork? Ready when you are, C.
LEADMALE:B.
LEADMALE:MINDY: Hey, Mork, are you up? Come on, get up.
SUPMALE:( singsongy ): Come and get it! I hope you like corn flakes.
LEADMALE:Why wouldn't I? Just because I'm from another planet doesn't mean I'm that different.
OTHERFEMALE:Trust me, you are different.
LEADFEMALE:( Orkan sounds ) Okay.
LEADMALE:Come on, let's have a little breakfast.
SUPFEMALE:May I be of some assistance? Oh, sure, uh I guess you could set the table.
LEADMALE:( monotonous hum ) Where would you like me to set it? Hurry up, I'm getting a cramp in my finger.
SUPFEMALE:Just set it back where it was.
SUPFEMALE:( speaking in reverse ) Nice way to build up an appetite.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so hungry I could eat a Flizbit.
SUPFEMALE:Well, today is going to be a big day.
SUPFEMALE:Today we're going to find you a new place to live.
LEADMALE:Why can't I go on living with you? Well, because my father is a conservative, puritanical mm Nerd.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:You got it.
SUPFEMALE:Ah! ( sizzles ) What is this black liquid? This is coffee.
LEADMALE:What do you do with it? We have it with our breakfast.
SUPMALE:Oh, allow me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, repulsive.
LEADMALE:You know, Mork, the more I think about it, I think that we'd better keep where you come from a secret.
LEADFEMALE:I hate to admit this, but people here on Earth get pretty hassled over anything they don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Why would anyone think I'm weird? We must save two to build a new race.
LEADFEMALE:Swim, you little nimnuls.
LEADFEMALE:I hope the rest can tread coffee.
LEADMALE:You know, I still can't get over this.
LEADMALE:I'm sitting here having breakfast with a being from another planet.
SUPMALE:What a coincidence.
LEADFEMALE:So am I.
OTHERMALE:You know, there's so much we can learn from each other.
OTHERFEMALE:Starting with me teaching you to act human so you don't get into any more trouble.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah, and another thing, I've got to find you a job.
LEADFEMALE:A job? Yeah, work, you know, like I work at the music store with my dad and my grandma.
SUPMALE:Oh, I was sent to observe Earth and report back everything to Orson on Ork.
LEADMALE:That's my job.
OTHERMALE:No, I mean like a job that pays money.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:You do understand the concept of money, don't you? Mindy, I am surprised at you.
LEADFEMALE:I am a member of a highly advanced civilization.
LEADMALE:My superiors on Ork thought of everything.
SUPFEMALE:Going down.
LEADFEMALE:Coming up.
LEADFEMALE:I bring with me untold wealth of the Universe.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, this looks heavy.
LEADMALE:What's in here? Look.
OTHERMALE:Oh, oh, careful, my bank's closed.
LEADMALE:This is sand.
OTHERMALE:Yes, it's been in my family for years.
LEADFEMALE:But, Mork, on-on Earth, sand is as common as, uh, dirt.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there goes bag two.
LEADMALE:Oh, but I realize my superiors might be nimnuls and I brought along something of unquestioned value throughout the universe.
SUPFEMALE:What? A credit card.
LEADMALE:I don't leave home without it.
OTHERMALE:FRED ( humming ): Um-pum Andante, andante, you butchers.
SUPMALE:Andante! Hey, Toscanini, knock it off! Do you know what that looks like from out there? That looks like you're out of your gourd.
LEADMALE:Back, back, back! You're blocking the violins.
SUPMALE:Get back.
OTHERMALE:Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp What did you do that for? You interrupted my sforzando.
LEADMALE:Now, now, don't get your Brahms in an uproar.
LEADFEMALE:Why do I have to put up with you? After all, it's my store.
LEADMALE:Lord, why did you create mothers-in-law? So they can work in the family store and ring up 83% of the sales.
SUPMALE:You're wretched.
OTHERFEMALE:Go ahead, Freddy, whip me with your words.
LEADFEMALE:Has Mindy come in yet? Mindy? No.
LEADMALE:No, she's probably hanging around with that absurd yo-yo.
LEADMALE:I'm worried, Cora.
LEADMALE:I'm scared to death it could become something serious.
OTHERFEMALE:After all, he's already spent the night with her.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, he stayed in her house.
OTHERFEMALE:There's a big difference.
LEADMALE:But that's the first step towards moving in.
LEADMALE:As far I know, he's over there right now.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you could pick up that phone and find out in a second.
LEADMALE:Oh, I couldn't do that.
LEADFEMALE:It would be too much like spying, as if I didn't trust her.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I could never bring myself to stoop so low.
SUPMALE:Oh, Freddy, you underestimate your potential.
OTHERMALE:( telephone ringing ) MINDY: Mork, will you answer that? ( telephone ringing ) Ring Ring Ring Please get the telephone.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, phone.
LEADFEMALE:( telephone ringing ) Primitive means of audio communication.
SUPMALE:( telephone ringing ) I wonder what it looks like.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Hello! ( ringing ) I killed it.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, hello? Hello? Hel hel hel Hello! I knew it.
SUPMALE:He's there.
LEADFEMALE:Now don't try to stop me, Cora.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody is going to corrupt my daughter until after she's married.
LEADMALE:He's such a wiener.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, on Earth, a gentleman always helps a lady on with her coat.
LEADFEMALE:( humming ) Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, on Earth, a gentleman also lets go of the coat.
LEADFEMALE:Keep your hands off that child.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, he was just helping me on with my coat.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing here? Me? What are you doing here? Now, I don't want any stories or any excuses.
LEADFEMALE:I want the plain, unvarnished truth.
LEADMALE:I spent the night.
SUPMALE:Couldn't you have varnished it just a little? Daddy, it's not like it seems.
LEADFEMALE:The only reason Mork spent the night here last night was because, uh uh Well, I can't tell you that; it's a secret.
LEADFEMALE:Secret? Secrets.
LEADMALE:We never had secrets from each other.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I demand to know what's going on between the two of you.
SUPFEMALE:After all, I love you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's nice.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, I am going to tell you something that you might find hard to believe.
LEADMALE:But you've got to promise not to breathe a word of this to anyone.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, okay, I promise.
LEADMALE:Mork is from Ork.
LEADMALE:It's another planet.
SUPFEMALE:( guffawing ) Mindy, I'm your father.
OTHERFEMALE:You can do better than that.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, do something.
LEADFEMALE:Show Daddy you're from Ork.
LEADMALE:Watch this, Daddy a little cosmic shtick.
LEADMALE:Many bleams ago, we Orkans realized the need to talk while drinking.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, am I thirsty.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to see a human do that.
SUPMALE:( burps ) Look, I-I don't know how you did that, but it's, uh, some kind of trick.
LEADMALE:It doesn't prove anything.
SUPFEMALE:Perhaps these color slides from Ork will.
SUPMALE:Uh, what's this supposed to be? Frizbot, the capital.
LEADFEMALE:Looks completely black.
LEADMALE:It's the inner city.
LEADMALE:Look, fella, you can't fool me.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody knows what space creatures look like.
LEADMALE:They have huge bald heads.
LEADMALE:Not always.
LEADMALE:Everybody knows that space creatures are always green.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you mean the old clichÃ© like this.
LEADMALE:( shrieks ) Nauseating, isn't it? It's not easy being green.
OTHERFEMALE:You're an alien! You're an alien! ( orkan sound ) Are you on vacation, or did you come down here to snatch a body? No, no, no, no, I didn't mean that.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy, Mork is from a highly advanced civilization.
LEADFEMALE:They did away with violence ages ago.
LEADFEMALE:Not only that.
OTHERFEMALE:I like you.
LEADMALE:Aw Oh, well, I like you, too, son.
SUPFEMALE:Burn that.
LEADMALE:Um, look, would you mind if I talk to my daughter in private? No offense, I mean it's not worth a death ray or anything like that.
OTHERMALE:Death ray? Oh, humor.
LEADMALE:( seal-like laugh ) Right on, Pops.
SUPMALE:What it was.
LEADMALE:I like Ike.
LEADMALE:Just gonna clean up the old room.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that something else? Mindy, let's have a father-daughter talk.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure.
LEADMALE:( shouting ): Get rid of him! Trash day.
LEADMALE:MINDY: We walk all over Boulder, and we still don't find you an apartment.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't worry, Mork, we'll find you a place to live.
LEADMALE:I saw a nice tree in the front yard.
LEADFEMALE:I could hang out there tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, I wouldn't put an Orkan out on a night like this.
LEADMALE:You'll just have to spend another night, that's all.
LEADMALE:Good.
OTHERMALE:I guess it's time to hit the old coat rack, then.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mork, not the armoire.
SUPMALE:You're on Earth now you might as well start acting a little more like it, right? True.
LEADMALE:Where do you sleep? On a bed.
LEADMALE:Boy, have you got a lot to learn.
OTHERMALE:Good, I'll sleep with you.
LEADMALE:I'm always willing to learn.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just sleep on the sofa tonight? Oh.
SUPFEMALE:On a flat surface? Won't I get dizzy? Well, you won't have far to fall.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, could you go up in the attic for me and get the old comforter? Oh, kay-o.
SUPMALE:That's "okay.
SUPMALE:" You thank.
LEADFEMALE:"Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:" You're welcome.
SUPMALE:Oh, if you have any trouble finding it, it's in the middle of the attic behind the old trunk.
LEADFEMALE:Got it? MORK ( goofy voice ): Ah-bad nee-bay.
OTHERMALE:Bad-ah nee.
SUPFEMALE:Which one's the comforter? I do hope it's this one.
LEADMALE:See, my comforter doesn't stare.
SUPFEMALE:( chuckles ) Never mind, I'll get it later.
LEADMALE:Nice place, your attic.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice? It's dark, dusty and full of spiders.
SUPFEMALE:Blech! My kind of town.
OTHERFEMALE:It's perfect.
LEADMALE:Could I live there? You know, actually, that attic wouldn't be such a bad place if we fixed it up.
LEADMALE:You know, it would be like having your own apartment.
LEADMALE:And it would be a perfect place for you to stay while you're adjusting to Earth.
LEADFEMALE:It'd be perfect.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Except for Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:He and I are having enough problems as it is.
LEADFEMALE:Stay.
SUPMALE:Problems? Yeah.
SUPMALE:May I be of some assistance? I'm afraid not.
SUPFEMALE:You see you are the problem.
SUPFEMALE:Me? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy made me promise to have you moved out by tonight or else.
LEADMALE:Oh, I see.
LEADMALE:I didn't want to cause trouble.
LEADMALE:Well, I must be leaving.
SUPMALE:Well, where are you going? You can't go now it's cold out and it looks like rain.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'm into weather.
LEADMALE:I will miss you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, wait, wait, Mork.
LEADMALE:I don't want you to go.
LEADFEMALE:You see, until I met you, I I never realized how dull and boring my life has been.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, you're a man from outer space.
LEADMALE:That's exciting! Exciting.
LEADFEMALE:Oh ( screams ) I told you, stay! I've never been called exciting before.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you are.
LEADMALE:I mean, think of it you're a you're an ambassador from another planet.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you're important.
SUPMALE:And if I can help you, that ( laughs ) that makes me feel important.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the important thing is the relationship between you and your father.
LEADFEMALE:I envy you that you have one.
SUPMALE:My father was an eyedropper.
SUPFEMALE:My mother was a sterile dish.
LEADFEMALE:Hard to warm up to old Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but, Mork, it's time that I It's best for you if I leave, but I can come back from time to time and take human lessons from you.
SUPMALE:You're already acting more human than a lot of people I know.
OTHERFEMALE:I have a solution.
SUPMALE:What? I'll call your father and tell him I'm leaving.
LEADMALE:Oh What's his number? ( makes beeping sounds ) ( line ringing ) It's ringing.
LEADMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:McConnell, Mork here.
SUPMALE:No, sir, that's not quite right.
SUPMALE:I'm a son of a test tube.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, um I just want to say, uh, I don't want to stand between you and Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:No, you won't be seeing me anymore.
LEADMALE:I thought it'd be nice if you came over and made up with Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Good-bye.
LEADFEMALE:There are some words I have to ask you about.
OTHERFEMALE:He's coming over.
LEADFEMALE:I I'd better be going.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, I feel so sad.
LEADMALE:Oh Oh You're soft.
SUPFEMALE:I could get to like that.
LEADMALE:Well, you just can't just walk out.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, not just like that.
LEADFEMALE:I know we'll have a toast, uh, to your new life.
LEADFEMALE:I'll break out the bubbly.
LEADFEMALE:Bubbly? Champagne.
SUPMALE:( like Lawrence Welk ): Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, thank you, let's all get down, get funky.
LEADFEMALE:The lovely Lemmon Sisters gonna sing "I Can't Get No Satisfaction.
LEADFEMALE:" Except in this case, the champagne has to be ginger ale because that's all I have.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well here's to the nicest alien I've ever met.
LEADFEMALE:And here's to the nicest alien I've ever met.
LEADMALE:And the softest.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) ( goofy muttering and chuckling ) ( shrieks, goofy singing ) ( continues goofy singing ) ( raspberry ) ( yells like Tarzan ) ( goofy shout ) Are you all right? Certainly I'm all right.
LEADFEMALE:( goofy, childlike shouting ) Oh, wow! Surf's up! Ha-ha! ( slow motion ): Oh, no! What's the matter? I think I'm getting Bezurb.
LEADMALE:What? ( deep, wavering moan ): Oh, oh, oh, oh The carbonation hits my bloodstream and I get Ork-faced.
LEADFEMALE:( goofy singing ) ( shrieking ) Going home, Mama! Waah! You're drunk! Hey, don't take away my gusto! ( goofy shout ) ( like Wicked Witch ): Oh, help me, I'm melting! ( laughing ) ( goofy singing ) I can't believe this.
LEADMALE:I got to sober you up.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:( doorbell rings ) FRED ( calling ): Mindy I'll get it.
OTHERFEMALE:No! You've got to hide.
SUPMALE:Oh, Moo-moo No, you got to Shh, shh, shh.
LEADMALE:Woop.
OTHERMALE:Stairway to the stars! Shh! Oh uh Oh, hello, Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, honey.
SUPFEMALE:I hate to barge in like this, but Mork called, and I kind of got to thinking about the way I acted.
OTHERFEMALE:I was out of line, Mindy, and I want to apologize.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Daddy, you don't have to apologize.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to say another thing.
LEADMALE:Well, I know I didn't have to, but I wanted to.
LEADMALE:You know, it's not easy being a father, Mindy.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Someday you'll be a father you'll understand.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:( yawns ) Oh, I'm really getting bushed.
LEADFEMALE:It's getting late.
LEADMALE:I'd better get Oh, yeah, it's, uh, nearly 7:30? But, then again, it's not very often we get to have these little father-and-daughter talks.
LEADMALE:You know what I mean, Dad? Just sit down right over here.
LEADFEMALE:You know, honey, I'm sorry if I'm a little overprotective about you and your boyfriends, but this Mork, I mean, he's a yo-yo, he's some sort of a creature from outer space.
LEADMALE:Well, I know that's a strike against him, but he's really not that different.
LEADMALE:You should just take a, you know, a closer look at him sometime.
LEADMALE:Oh, is that so? Well, why don't you take a really close look ( screams ) Aw, bummer.
SUPFEMALE:What's he doing here?! Now, Daddy, don't get excited.
LEADMALE:I can explain.
LEADMALE:You lied to me! You broke your promise! ( growling ) Down, boy.
LEADFEMALE:Down.
LEADMALE:Heel, heel.
OTHERFEMALE:Sit! Sit! Well, I didn't break my promise, but you bullied me into that promise, you know.
LEADFEMALE:I bullied you into it? Well, I'm a father! What are fathers for? Well, you're just not gonna do it anymore, Dad, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:I'm 21 years old, I have my own apartment, I'm a grown woman, and if I feel like it, I'm going to keep an Orkan in my attic.
OTHERMALE:Well, I don't feel like it! So, in other words, what you're asking is that I choose between you and Mork? Right.
SUPFEMALE:Well, don't force me to make that choice, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:I'm forcing you.
LEADMALE:Mork stays.
LEADMALE:Good night, Daddy.
SUPMALE:Good night, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:( honks horn ) Moo-moo says hi, too.
SUPFEMALE:I'm warning you, if I leave here, I'm never coming back.
OTHERFEMALE:Never! If that's the way you feel.
LEADMALE:( door slamming ) On the other hand, never is much too long.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Oh Oh, good, you two are back together.
OTHERMALE:Mork, you're sober.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, we Orkans only stay bezurb for 60 seconds.
LEADMALE:Well, you were gone for a good five minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Whew! I was out for a long time.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Must've really hung one on.
OTHERMALE:You mean, he's still staying here tonight? Yes, Daddy, but nothing is going to happen.
LEADFEMALE:Do you believe that? Of course I do, honey.
LEADFEMALE:You gave me your word, and I trust you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:But I don't trust him.
LEADFEMALE:I'm staying the night.
LEADMALE:Oh, good company.
SUPMALE:Well, you can have my place, Pops and I'll camp out.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:( slow motion ): Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:( slower ): Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in Orson.
LEADFEMALE:ORSON: Orson to Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Am I coming in loud and clear? Uh, too loud, too clear.
SUPFEMALE:You're coming in fuzzy.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter with your head? Oh, I'm sending fuzzy.
LEADMALE:I think I got a little bezurb last night.
LEADMALE:You're supposed to be observing the planet, not running around getting Ork-faced.
SUPFEMALE:How's the sand holding out? I've been meaning to talk to you about that, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:I found a very safe place to put it a cat box.
LEADFEMALE:But that's a Yes.
LEADMALE:That's what it's worth here, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Haven't you found out anything important? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Believe it or not, trees are green on Earth.
SUPFEMALE:There's a black liquid that sells for three dollars a pound, and it takes two to tango.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, something really important.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Remember that girl I told you about? Yes.
OTHERMALE:Well, she did something very nice.
SUPFEMALE:She defended me against her father.
LEADMALE:That was a very brave and kind thing to do, and I don't know, I think I'm coming down with Feelings for her.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you know emotions are hazardous to your health.
SUPFEMALE:Don't start playing around with that stuff.
SUPMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:Not me.
SUPMALE:You can trust me, sir.
LEADFEMALE:This is Mork, signing off from Boulder, Colorado.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, I'm glad I didn't land in Buffalo.
LEADMALE:See you next week, sir.
SUPMALE:
