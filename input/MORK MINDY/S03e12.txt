OTHERMALE:Okay, kids, something new for today.
OTHERMALE:It's called Record Hour.
LEADFEMALE:Stuff Record Hour.
SUPFEMALE:I'd rather have lunch hour.
LEADMALE:No, Stephanie, you just had lunch, and somewhere, a small country's going hungry.
LEADFEMALE:What's Record Hour, Mork? Oh, well, Record Hour's-- Mindy gave us a record player so we can play records I've been wanting to play.
LEADFEMALE:All those wonderful stories.
OTHERFEMALE:Today we have a fairy tale documentary called War of the Worlds.
LEADFEMALE:It's told to us by the biggest Mother Goose of them all, Orson Welles.
SUPMALE:There we go.
SUPMALE:Watch this.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:Watch this.
SUPMALE:Spin.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, yeah.
SUPMALE:Manual.
SUPMALE:There we are.
LEADMALE:There we go.
LEADMALE:We bought it from Nixon's secretary.
LEADMALE:Hold on.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, there seems to be, as the Egyptians say, tut-tut, a problem.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, I killed it.
LEADFEMALE:I've committed stereocide.
LEADFEMALE:Stereocide, stereocide.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna go to Dolby hell for this.
LEADFEMALE:I guess Record Hour just bit the dust.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, it didn't.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:The show must go on, Jose, because if not, we'll lose our grant from The Chrysler Foundation.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:Wait, we'll start over from the beginning.
LEADFEMALE:All right, here we go.
SUPMALE:Once upon a time, a group of people decided to leave their home, and heads towards, heads towards, heads towards Heads towards Earth.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Jon.
OTHERMALE:That's the way the record does it at Mindy's house.
LEADFEMALE:It's a little touch of realism here.
LEADMALE:Mork, could you finish the story while we're still kids? Thank you, Lola.
LEADFEMALE:No pressure.
LEADFEMALE:Now, basically, the story ends like this.
SUPMALE:All these aliens landed in Hollywood.
LEADFEMALE:They were put on hold, and they died a horrible death.
LEADFEMALE:Well That's all for today.
SUPFEMALE:Time for playtime.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Fowler's waiting for you out in the yard.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't tie her up like you did yesterday.
SUPMALE:Someone tied a real good hitch knot.
LEADFEMALE:Have a good time.
LEADFEMALE:Be careful.
SUPFEMALE:Be careful.
OTHERMALE:That's okay, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:We know you meant well.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for the pity, Jonathan.
LEADFEMALE:I blew it in front of all the munchkins.
LEADFEMALE:What am I gonna tell Mindy about her record player? Everybody with a working record player take one step forward.
LEADFEMALE:Not so fast, McConnell.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:What makes you think something's wrong with your record player? What? All right, all right.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you.
LEADMALE:Well, your record player is se habla appliance, finito.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, not again.
OTHERMALE:I just got this thing fixed last week.
LEADMALE:Well, obviously, the repairman did a crummy job.
LEADFEMALE:I thought everyone on Earth took pride in what they did, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Well, most do, Mork.
LEADMALE:Let's just hope this repairman is one of them.
LEADFEMALE:Strange.
LEADMALE:Throughout the universe, all work is guaranteed.
SUPMALE:Even I have a warranty from the laboratory I was made in.
OTHERFEMALE:- For what? - Well, ankle blowouts, rusted skin.
OTHERFEMALE:Coughing up frogs.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:They guarantee Orkans? Yeah, I was the only Orkan ever to be recalled.
SUPMALE:What? Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell me you coughed up a frog.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:I was jogging at the speed of sound.
LEADMALE:I turned the corner real fast, and my rear end fell off.
LEADFEMALE:But-- But they fixed it, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:No ifs, ands or butts.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Strand's Repair Shop? This is Mindy McConnell.
SUPMALE:Yes, the same one that called you this morning.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I'd try to convince you one more time.
LEADFEMALE:But I already paid for it once.
OTHERMALE:Tough what? Now, listen you-- Wait, don't put me on hold.
LEADFEMALE:I-- They put me on hold.
SUPFEMALE:Come in.
SUPMALE:I mean, come in.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Did we catch you at a bad time? I hate it when they put you on hold.
SUPFEMALE:And they're playing ''Put On A Happy Face.
SUPMALE:'' Oh, I'll just call him back later.
SUPMALE:My, my, it isn't often we see the dark side of Mindy Poppins.
LEADMALE:We're gonna take a little drive up into the snow, and we thought maybe you and Mork wanted to come and help build snowwomen.
LEADMALE:Anatomically correct until the sun comes out.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks, you guys, but Mork's not here, and I'm too ticked off to go anywhere.
SUPMALE:Wait, we're family, and we think as one.
LEADMALE:Let me guess what's troubling you.
SUPFEMALE:Crime in the streets? Yes, but not this time.
LEADMALE:I'm mad because I took my stereo down to have it fixed last week, and this week, it doesn't work again for the same reason, and I can't get the repairman to stand behind his work and fix it again.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I have a system that works for me when something breaks down.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it'll work for you.
LEADMALE:- What's that? - I throw it away and buy a new one.
LEADMALE:Glenda, you'd throw away a perfectly good stereo? Well, I'd take the records off first.
LEADMALE:Isn't that a little bit wasteful? No, not really.
LEADMALE:I do it to relieve stress.
SUPMALE:You see, I just don't throw things away.
LEADFEMALE:I give them a sound thrashing first.
LEADMALE:Glenda, you're so esoteric.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I like about you.
SUPMALE:And that's what I like about you.
LEADMALE:That you like that about me.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Glenda, I feel the stirrings of something special between us, don't you? No.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe if I got her drunk.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, kiss those repair blues goodbye.
OTHERMALE:Boy.
OTHERMALE:Boy, we're gonna sue that sucker real bad.
LEADMALE:We're gonna habeas his corpus, or my name isn't F.
LEADFEMALE:Lee Mork.
LEADMALE:What's the little jellybean chattering about now? I'm not chattering at all.
LEADFEMALE:After I read these law books from the library-- Look.
SUPMALE:Look at this, Mind.
SUPMALE:''Disney v.
OTHERFEMALE:Duck.
SUPMALE:'' When did you get a library card? Card? You can't take books out of the library without a card.
LEADFEMALE:No wonder that old lady hurdled over the desk and chased me.
SUPFEMALE:She would have caught me too if her cane hadn't snapped.
LEADFEMALE:Nice try, guy, but you're wasting your time.
LEADFEMALE:- Lawsuits drag on for years.
LEADFEMALE:- Why does justice take so long? Because lawyers are paid by the hour.
SUPMALE:Well, I just can't let him get away with this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going down there and I'm gonna make him fix this thing.
OTHERFEMALE:If he won't, at least I'll have the satisfaction of giving him a good piece of my mind.
LEADMALE:I should go.
LEADFEMALE:In case you give him too much, you might need someone to show you the way home.
LEADMALE:Mindy, you should come on that drive with us.
LEADFEMALE:A couple of hours in the snow, and you'll see how unimportant turntables are in the grand scheme of Iife.
LEADMALE:It puts everything into perspective.
SUPMALE:The crisp, chilly, frosty air.
LEADMALE:It's a winter wonderland.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thanks, you guys.
SUPFEMALE:It sounds great, but I have to take care of this.
LEADFEMALE:While we're in that wonderland, we could do some favours for people, like we'll chip the frozen birds off the trees and fling them south.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy, Mork.
SUPMALE:- I hope I can hold my temper.
LEADMALE:- That's all right, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Here, you hold the record player.
SUPMALE:I'll hold your temper.
SUPMALE:- Can you just put it on the table there? - Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That's him.
LEADFEMALE:That's Mr.
SUPMALE:Strand.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he seems like a nice man.
SUPFEMALE:Watch this.
SUPMALE:- Hello.
LEADFEMALE:- What the hell do you want? Mind, not my lucky day.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Strand, I'd like you to fix this.
LEADMALE:Wasn't this thing in here last week? As a matter of fact, it was, and it still doesn't work.
LEADMALE:- So? - So I think you should fix it.
SUPFEMALE:Sure, I'd be happy to fix it for you.
LEADFEMALE:- You would? - Yep, for my basic service charge.
LEADMALE:- What? - He said his basic-- I heard what he said, Mork, but that's not fair.
LEADMALE:I brought this thing in last week.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't fix it right.
SUPMALE:I think now you should fix it again for free.
LEADMALE:Look, lady, this thing worked fine when it left the shop here.
OTHERMALE:You want that fixed free? You gotta go to the manufacturer.
SUPMALE:- Okay, where is that? - Taiwan.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:When do they close? Listen, mister.
LEADFEMALE:For your information, I happen to work for KTNS-TV, and I think a lot of people would be real interested to hear how you do business.
LEADMALE:Terrific.
LEADMALE:While you're at it, why don't you tell them about this mixer? It's been here for a month.
SUPFEMALE:It belongs to Ralph Nader.
LEADFEMALE:Now, get out of my shop.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, if I wasn't a lady, I'd drop him.
LEADFEMALE:That's all right, Mind, I'm no lady.
SUPFEMALE:Watch this.
SUPMALE:All right, sir, you think you're so tough? Come on.
LEADFEMALE:I dare you to knock this off my shoulder.
LEADMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, hey, you're talking to a guy that doesn't know the meaning of the word quit.
LEADMALE:Oh, quit: verb, intransitive, means to cease or desist a plan of action.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:Go on.
LEADMALE:Out, out, get out of here.
LEADMALE:All right, we're going, but you haven't heard the last from me, Mr.
LEADMALE:Strand.
OTHERMALE:And you haven't seen the last of her, Mr.
LEADMALE:Strand.
LEADFEMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:Get the heck out of here.
LEADMALE:Couldn't we talk this over a couple of sissy drinks in a fern bar? I'm warning you.
LEADFEMALE:What are you, Jack the Whipper? Come on, you wanna mix it up with me? - Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
OTHERMALE:- I'm not afraid of you.
LEADMALE:- No? Yeah, but my feet are.
LEADFEMALE:Two to one, they win.
SUPMALE:Don't fail me now.
SUPMALE:Mind, Mork is one consumer who's had enough.
LEADMALE:Listen, I've written all the way to the top.
LEADFEMALE:''Dear Pope John Paul.
LEADFEMALE:'' ''Morkus Orkus.
LEADFEMALE:'' Oh, talk about your fast service.
OTHERFEMALE:That's His Eminence now.
LEADMALE:Mind, get some ermine.
LEADFEMALE:Quick, get some ermine.
OTHERFEMALE:Ave Mari-- Oh, it's you.
SUPFEMALE:I thought it was the guy with the little red shoes.
LEADMALE:Don't try to figure it out.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, look, I was on my way home from rehearsal, and I thought I'd drop by and take a look at your record player.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Dad, but it's a complicated machine.
LEADFEMALE:Well, honey, I used to fix all your toys.
SUPMALE:Remember when I put that front wheel back on your tricycle? It worked fine.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, until the night I rode down Feldman's hill.
LEADFEMALE:But you said the sparks were pretty.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Pops, I didn't know you were an appliance doctor.
LEADFEMALE:- Dad.
SUPMALE:- Well, it always works on my TV.
SUPMALE:Hey, here's that screwdriver you asked to borrow.
SUPFEMALE:Be careful with it.
OTHERMALE:My parents gave it to me for graduation.
SUPFEMALE:It tells you a lot about the folks, doesn't it? - That's a real sweet gift, Bick.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yeah, it's a family trait.
LEADMALE:I hope the screwdriver doesn't work.
LEADMALE:It's nice to have a break from that sound-effects record Mork keeps playing.
LEADFEMALE:It's not easy to get a woman in the mood with the sound of stampeding elephants coming from the next apartment.
SUPMALE:No, no, no, that's Ferrets in Love.
SUPMALE:I'll wait for the video disc.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:We'll get it fixed.
SUPFEMALE:I'll have this manual figured out in two or three weeks.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I had a typewriter fixed once, but when I started writing my greeting cards, it still wouldn't type the letter L.
LEADMALE:Can you imagine? Good uck on your trip.
SUPFEMALE:Nighty night.
SUPMALE:Oh, hello, Fred, it's always fun.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, why don't we just save ourselves the aggravation, and I'll pay for the repair myself? Oh, Dad.
SUPMALE:I mean, thanks, anyway, but it's the principle here that counts.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, millions of people are taken advantage of like this every year.
LEADMALE:Well, there's gotta be some way of getting justice.
LEADFEMALE:Justice.
SUPMALE:Wheels turning.
LEADFEMALE:Something's happening Something big Mork has a better idea, Mind.
SUPMALE:Mork, what's going on in that fertile Orkan mind? Oh, nothing.
SUPMALE:Nothing at all.
LEADFEMALE:Just that justice moves in strange ways.
SUPFEMALE:See you later.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and I thought he'd never adjust.
LEADFEMALE:I don't wanna see that Cuisinart in here again.
SUPMALE:Music to my ears.
LEADMALE:One, two, three, four.
LEADFEMALE:What, what, what? That will teach me to fix my own lights.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey.
SUPFEMALE:What? Augustus J.
LEADMALE:Strand.
LEADMALE:Who are you? - What are you? - I am Tommy Kilowatt.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.

LEADMALE:And you are being put on trial by the Supremes Court-- No, no.

SUPFEMALE:Trial? What? No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:We're closed up for the-- - I'm getting out of here.
LEADMALE:- No.
SUPMALE:Closed? You think justice punches a time clock? Do you think truth works 9 to 5? Does Geraldo Rivera ever stop talking? I say nay.
LEADMALE:Let the trial begin.
LEADFEMALE:Presiding over tonight's circuit court, the Honourable Judge Oliver T.
SUPFEMALE:Wendell Tube.
LEADFEMALE:All those present shall speak through me.

LEADMALE:Not too bad.
LEADFEMALE:Cough.
LEADFEMALE:Cough.
OTHERFEMALE:- Morning.
LEADMALE:- Oh, morning, Mind.
LEADMALE:Feign nonchalance.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, I think today is a wonderful day to take the record player back to the shop.
OTHERMALE:No, Mork, I think today is a wonderful day to go to work, and make money to buy a new one.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I think things would be a lot different if you'd take it back today.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, there's this kind of Strange feeling passing through me Mork, you didn't happen to go to the repair shop Iast night, did you? Could be.
LEADMALE:And you didn't happen to talk to Mr.
LEADMALE:Strand, did you? Could be, part two.
LEADFEMALE:Why am I worried to hear about could be, part three? Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Miss McConnell? I I just came by to apologize to you.

SUPFEMALE:- Yeah, well, I'll have this back to you early Monday morning.
LEADMALE:It'll be all fixed free of charge.
LEADMALE:Well, that's great, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Strand, but why the sudden change of heart? Well, let's just say that I-- I had a nightmare last night.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, it made me realize that I should take a lot more pride in my work.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this has got a little scratch.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you ought to treat your appliances with a lot more respect.
SUPFEMALE:They have feelings too, you know? Come on.
SUPMALE:Come on, little fella, here we go.
LEADFEMALE:See you.
SUPMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:Mork, he's like a completely different man.
LEADMALE:- What could have gotten into him? - Oh, nothing on Earth, Mind.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:When you went to the repair shop, you didn't happen toanything, did you? Wrong hand, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you know you shouldn't go around zapping things all the time.
SUPMALE:But this time you did good.
OTHERFEMALE:I did good? Well, that's the second time this week.
OTHERMALE:Oh, what was the first time? Remember you said, ''Anyone who's really famous in television has their name known all over town''? Mind, you are gonna be up there in lights.
LEADFEMALE:- I mean, a known success.
SUPMALE:- I am? See, I went all over Boulder, and wrote your name in every phone booth in town.
SUPMALE:For a perky time, call Mindy.
LEADMALE:That's for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello? Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Your Boob-Tubeness.
SUPMALE:- ls that you, Mork? - Oh, yes, sir.
SUPMALE:Talk about your bad connections here.
SUPMALE:Beebs, have you been chewing on the lines again? Lorne Greene said kibble, not cable.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork, pull yourself together.
LEADFEMALE:- Yes, sir.
LEADMALE:Good to have you back.
LEADMALE:Sorry, sir, I lost my head.
OTHERMALE:Have you been tinkering with your knobs again? Oh, no way, sir.
SUPMALE:I just had my 3,000-report checkup.
LEADMALE:I must be suffering from that universal disease called shoddy workmanship.
LEADMALE:One of the main symptoms is feeling like you've just been ripped off.
SUPFEMALE:What causes this disease? Well, sir, apathy, lack of pride in one's work, greed.
LEADFEMALE:What happened to responsibility? Well, sir, it's in the shop.
SUPFEMALE:It'll be ready Tuesday.
SUPFEMALE:You see, I've learned that most Earthlings consider a job just a way of making money.
LEADMALE:lsn't there a saying on Earth, ''Money talks''? Yeah, sir, but nothing speaks as eloquently as a job well done, or Brooke Shields' jeans saying, ''Give me air.
LEADMALE:'' Until next week, sir.
