LEADFEMALE:So I met this wonderful cabdriver named Aloo and he took me shopping.
SUPMALE:Uh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:See, I'm having a political affair tomorrow.

LEADMALE:Can I help you maybe? Can I help, huh? Je t'assiste? Ha-ha! Gee, Mork, I'm sorry, but I don't know how you could help.
LEADFEMALE:I helped before.
LEADMALE:Remember that surprise party for Remo when I invited everyone? Except Remo.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Boy, is he gonna be surprised when he finds out.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Since it's a political affair, maybe I could possibly plan the menu.
LEADMALE:Since they're politicians, we could have ham stuffed with bologna.
SUPMALE:And then have junkets for everybody.
LEADMALE:Oh, I guess I'm not being very helpful, am I? Oh, Mork, well, you At least you always give it a good shot.
LEADFEMALE:And I'll tell you, I don't know what I'd do without you.

OTHERMALE:Remember when I had a cold and I took a pill and it made me real small? Oh, yeah, you laughed then too.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but I don't have a cold now.
LEADFEMALE:I must be having an allergic reaction to something.
LEADFEMALE:Huh.
LEADMALE:Well, whenever we have an allergic reaction, we sneeze, like, you know, like "Ah-choo!" Well, that's what happens when we eat burritos.
LEADMALE:I must be allergic to something in the room then.

SUPMALE:Something wrong? I have an allergy.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe you should go get some allergy shots.
LEADFEMALE:What are those? Well, a doctor injects small amounts of whatever you're allergic to into your arm, and then gradually he increases the dose.
SUPFEMALE:Where I'm from, we have a little man that drills inside your nose with sandpaper and a hose.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ) You know what? I bet that you'll find that allergy shots work much better.
LEADMALE:You mean I can be cured? Well, there's a real good chance.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, doctor, mmmmm.
SUPFEMALE:You're welcome.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey.

SUPFEMALE:That sorta changes things.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I did read once about this couple who had been happily married for ten years and then, bam, all of a sudden the husband was allergic to his own wife.
LEADMALE:Then the doctor cured him, right? They were forced to split up.
LEADFEMALE:They never saw each other again.
SUPMALE:EXIDOR: Step aside.
SUPFEMALE:Don't push.

LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:There's more to life than just preaching, you know.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh-ho-ho! Why don't you go home to your fox? I can't live with Mindy.
SUPMALE:She threw you out? I'll put a hex on her in the morning, as soon as they deliver the dead coyotes.
OTHERFEMALE:Tonight you stay here.

OTHERMALE:I was lonesome too until Gretchie asked me to move in with her.
LEADFEMALE:This is her place.
SUPFEMALE:How she can afford it, I'll never know.

SUPMALE:I developed a revolutionary allergy treatment years ago when I was a doctor.
LEADMALE:This may be too tough for you, darling.
SUPFEMALE:I injected the hair of a yak in the arm of an orangutan.
LEADMALE:Did the cure work? Do you ever hear any sneezing in jungle movies? Well, do you think maybe if I put some of Mindy's hair and inject it in my arm, it'll cure me? ( laughs ) Stop, stop that tickling, now.

LEADMALE:Well, you can count on my vote, Flavor.
LEADFEMALE:It's refreshing to meet someone who has such compassion for the rich.
SUPMALE:I look at it this way.
LEADFEMALE:Who are the rich, but poor people with yachts? Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Before I run off, uh, can I get you anything? Impossible.
LEADMALE:I have everything.

SUPFEMALE:Why don't you throw her out and I'll go powder my nose? Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, when does this wear off? Let go.
LEADMALE:You're hurting me.
OTHERFEMALE:PRENDERGAST: Who are you? I'm Mindy, Nelson's cousin, but let's not talk about that.
LEADMALE:Let's dance till we don't know who we are.
LEADFEMALE:Come.

SUPFEMALE:I've got some good news for you.
SUPMALE:The Mindy injection wore off and I'm almost back to abnormal.
LEADMALE:( chuckles ) Yeah.
LEADMALE:You're still mad, aren't you? Well, Mork, I'm not mad because you blew my party and I'm not mad because Nelson cried on my shoulder till my dress shrank.
LEADFEMALE:But what I am upset about is that you just can't be you.
SUPFEMALE:Ha! Well, no, I I've tried everything and nothing works.
SUPMALE:I've been thinking, you didn't get sick until after I held you close and told you how much you meant to me.
SUPMALE:So? So I think maybe you're not allergic to me at all.
LEADFEMALE:I think maybe you're just afraid of getting too close to someone.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, I I think now you're being real silly.
OTHERMALE:No, really.
SUPMALE:( Laughs ) You're being kind of silly there.
SUPMALE:No, I think it scares you.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:After all, it still It still is a new emotion.

SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Ha! Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:You keep away from me, boy.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-uh.
OTHERFEMALE:Nuh-uh.
LEADFEMALE:There's nothing in the air that you're allergic to.
LEADMALE:That's why none of those things worked.
LEADFEMALE:You tried air hoses, nose plugs, allergy shots.
OTHERMALE:And now you're gonna try a little of me.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha! No, no.
LEADFEMALE:( southern accent ): I'm gonna hug you till your eyes pop out.
LEADFEMALE:No way! ( laughing uncontrollably ) ( normal voice ): It's all right.
LEADMALE:( laughter subsiding ) There.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Ohhh.
LEADFEMALE:You stopped laughing.

LEADFEMALE:Sure beats the heck out of going to a doctor, huh? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks, you You helped me be more human.
LEADMALE:Well, what's an earthling for, after all, right? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You know what? What? Your underwear is kinda comfortable.
SUPFEMALE:Let me show you ( upbeat theme playing ) ( mystical theme playing ) MORK: Mork calling Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:( imitates zooming, imitates buzzing ) ORSON: What did you learn this week? Oh, beaucoup de choses, Your Lordship.
LEADMALE:But mainly I learned a lot about politics.
LEADFEMALE:What's politics? It's the art of fooling most of the people most of the time, as often as possible.
LEADMALE:Politics sounds very strange.
LEADMALE:Oh, it is, sir.
LEADMALE:A politician will do anything to get in office.
SUPFEMALE:He'll kiss babies, mules.
LEADMALE:When he finally gets into office and you call him, they say, "He's not in the office at this time.
LEADMALE:Beep!" Don't Earthlings have any leaders they admire? Oh, yes, sir, they do.
LEADMALE:But they're all dead.
LEADFEMALE:The most famous is one called George Washington.
SUPMALE:He's the one that's on the dollar bill that's only worth 45 cents.
SUPMALE:What did he do? Well, he slept here, he slept here, he slept there.
OTHERMALE:I guess that's why most politicians honor him by doing the same thing.
LEADMALE:It looks like you've learned a lot, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, more than you know, sir.
LEADMALE:( chuckles ) I even learned that an allergy is nothing to sneeze at.
LEADFEMALE:Argh! You mean you were sick? Well, sir, I wouldn't call it that, but I I did develop an extreme reaction to being too close to Mindy.
LEADMALE:You're playing with fire, Mork.
SUPMALE:I know, sir.
LEADMALE:According to the Orkan General, closeness is the leading cause of disease.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sir, I I used to believe that old voodoo.
LEADFEMALE:But if closeness is so wrong, why are we born with arms, huh? Isn't that kind of Zen-like? Think about that till next week, sir.
LEADFEMALE:It'll probably take you an hour or so.
OTHERFEMALE:Catch you later.
LEADMALE:Until then ( chanting ): Ommm, ommm on the range.
SUPMALE:
