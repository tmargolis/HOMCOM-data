LEADFEMALE:Beggars shouldn't be choosers.
LEADMALE:If you don't get a new car soon, you're gonna be hitchhiking to medical school.
OTHERMALE:( Greek accent ): Eureka! They are finished.

LEADFEMALE:Hi, Nel ( woman screams ) Excuse me, madam.
LEADFEMALE:Nelson, what is wrong with you? I've been getting threatening phone calls.
SUPMALE:And quite frankly, it's scaring the bejeebies outta me.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down and tell us about it.
LEADFEMALE:Some member of the lunatic fringe has been calling and saying that if I don't drop out of the city council race, I'd better start praying.
LEADFEMALE:That's gonna be trouble.
SUPMALE:Mindy said you didn't have a prayer.
LEADMALE:Eh, do you have any idea who it is? No, except that it's a woman's voice.
LEADFEMALE:A woman? He's scared of a woman.
LEADMALE:( laughs ) Oh, please.
LEADFEMALE:And why shouldn't he be scared of a woman? You never heard of Lizzie Borden, Mata Hari, Ma Barker? Ma Bell.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, women have the right to be homicidal maniacs too, you know.
LEADMALE:Hey, cease and desist, quipsters.
OTHERFEMALE:My life could be at stake here.
SUPFEMALE:Nelson's right, it doesn't matter whether it's a man or a woman.
SUPFEMALE:Crank calls can really be scary.
SUPMALE:Yeah, birdcalls can be scary too.
LEADFEMALE:( squawking ) Let me tell you, obscene phone calls aren't any fun either.
LEADFEMALE:I got a whole bunch when I was living back east.
LEADMALE:I was petrified.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Did you call the phone company? No, they wouldn't press charges.
OTHERMALE:He was one of their best customers.
SUPFEMALE:( chuckles ) You know, there must be a reason that that woman is making these calls.
LEADMALE:Yeah, who would hate you enough to do something like this? I've got it.
LEADMALE:It's an old girlfriend that you used and threw away like a dirty sock.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think so.
SUPMALE:Most girls I use never call me again.
SUPMALE:It's probably political.
SUPMALE:Maybe it's one of the other candidates that's doing it.
LEADMALE:Think about it, Nelson, it'd have to be somebody conniving.
SUPMALE:Somebody who'd stop at nothing to get what he wants.
LEADMALE:Don't be ridiculous, Min.
LEADMALE:Why would Nelson call himself? ( playful theme playing ) Boop! Boop! Boop! Mork? Mork? Boop! ( whistles ) Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Think you could read a little more quietly? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:( mouths ): Boop.
SUPFEMALE:( mouths ): Boop.
OTHERFEMALE:( mouths ): Boop.
LEADMALE:It's for you.
SUPFEMALE:Why, that's amazing.
LEADMALE:How did you know that? I didn't.
SUPFEMALE:But I didn't wanna stop reading until I got to see if Lolita gets to use her crayons or not.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha! Nelson.
LEADFEMALE:What is all this? It's a disguise.
OTHERMALE:Ah, you're masquerading as a traveling flasher, eh? I got another phone call from that crazy woman.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Are you sure it's the same one? Down to the last threat.
LEADMALE:She asked me strange questions like, "Guess who's not gonna make it till election day?" Maybe she's just trying to change your political image.
SUPMALE:Yeah, she says she's gonna do it with an ax.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's terrible.
SUPFEMALE:Are you on your way to a hotel? No.
LEADMALE:Are you, uh, going out of town? No.
LEADMALE:You're staying here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank you, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:I knew that when a fella gets in a jam, the first people he should turn to is family.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, cuz.
LEADFEMALE:Ohhh NELSON: I just wanna say thanks.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Make yourself at home.
LEADFEMALE:Nelson, if I were you I'd call the police.
SUPFEMALE:I did.
LEADFEMALE:They said that a crank call isn't a crime.
LEADFEMALE:I guess they can't do anything till I'm actually dead.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe they'd investigate if you just laid there real still.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we'll deal with all this tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:In the meantime, you're safe here.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Mindy.
SUPMALE:Morky.
SUPFEMALE:It's people like you that make people like me like people like you.

LEADMALE:( Nelson screams ) NELSON: Don't turn out the lights! What's wrong? I I can't sleep with the lights out.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I better read you a story, that might help.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Here you go.
LEADFEMALE:"The moon highlighted her golden hair, and she could hear the soft twittering of a nightingale as she plunged the dagger again and again into Derek's back.
SUPFEMALE:" ( playful theme playing ) Don't tell me, um, Orkan calisthenics? No, I'm working on my impression of Nelson's lava lamp.
SUPFEMALE:That's pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, guess what I'm doing.
SUPFEMALE:( snorting ) Billy Carter.
LEADFEMALE:( Laughs ) No.
SUPMALE:Oh, the Vienna Hogs' Choir.
LEADMALE:No, it's Nelson snoring.
SUPFEMALE:He kept me awake all night last night.
LEADFEMALE:Why would Nelson bring his lava lamp? It gives him a sense of security, makes him feel like he's almost hip.
LEADMALE:( laughs ) ( phone rings ) Phone.
SUPFEMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:Hello? No, he's in the shower now.
SUPFEMALE:Can I help you? I'll take a message if I can.
SUPFEMALE:( mouthed dialogue ) Something to write on.
SUPFEMALE:Pardon the delay, it's hard to get good Caucasian help.
LEADFEMALE:Hello ( indistinct speech over phone ) Mork, she says she's gonna get us too and she knows where we live.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Death, despair, doom.
SUPMALE:Come on, Min.
LEADFEMALE:We've gotta bolt the windows up.
LEADMALE:We gotta barricade the door.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, come on.
LEADMALE:Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, order some pizzas, Min.
SUPFEMALE:Make 'em frozen pizzas, we can suck on 'em, they'll last longer.
OTHERMALE:This is serious.
LEADFEMALE:We've gotta think about this calmly.
SUPFEMALE:All right, Mind.
LEADMALE:What we can do is create an electromagnetic force field.
LEADMALE:We need some zirconium and a cambrium laser.
SUPFEMALE:Now, where do you put your cambrium lasers and Hi, guys, what's all the hubbub? Get down! Get down! Do I sense danger? No, you sense threats.
LEADMALE:That woman called again.
SUPMALE:She said she'll arrange it so you can dance cheek-to-cheek with yourself.
SUPMALE:She did? Don't ever leave me.
LEADMALE:The worst part is she knows where we are.
LEADMALE:Now, we've gotta figure this thing out.
LEADMALE:Why don't you come down here and cower with us, Miss Brave? Not on the floor, on the sofa.
SUPMALE:What, you guys think she's gonna shoot us through the window? ( all screaming ) MORK: It was probably Mr.
SUPMALE:Death.
OTHERMALE:It was Mr.
LEADMALE:Barstool.
SUPFEMALE:Well, so this is politics.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I shouldn'ta left your phone number with my answering service.
LEADMALE:You left my number with your service? Well, only a few of the calls I get are death threats.
LEADMALE:I do have an attachÃ© case business to run, you know.
LEADMALE:Come on, you guys, I mean, I think we're overreacting to this whole thing.
SUPMALE:I mean, there's not gonna be any violence.
SUPFEMALE:I read the people who make phone threats rarely cut you into little pieces.
LEADMALE:How rarely? Well, never more than once.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, let's not be so paranoid.
LEADFEMALE:And let's not let this crazy woman get to us.
LEADMALE:Let's just start acting like normal.
LEADMALE:See? Now, isn't this better? ( all screaming ) Somebody broke my window.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's nothing much, Min.
OTHERMALE:It's just a smoking can.
LEADMALE:It's a bomb! Toss it, toss it! Okay.
LEADMALE:Not to me! ( Mindy screaming ) ( suspenseful theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) ( nasal voice): Well, we'll do all we can.
SUPMALE:This stink bomb is probably just an isolated case of vandalism.
SUPMALE:That's what some people said about Pearl Harbor.
OTHERFEMALE:But our lives are in danger.
LEADFEMALE:( nasal voice ): Maybe that's why Joseph Wambaugh left the force.
LEADFEMALE:This place kinda smells like cheese on a radiator.
SUPMALE:What price charisma? Well, in case the worst happens, I decided to make out my last will and testament.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:Could I have your lava lamp and your collective works of Walter Mondale? Nelson, what we have to do is figure out why somebody's after you.
LEADMALE:I've got it.
SUPMALE:I've got it.
SUPFEMALE:When you were a baby, you were abducted by a wandering tribe of albinos.
OTHERMALE:They were gonna make you their king.
LEADMALE:But you were smart, even at that young age, and you escaped by running away nude in a snowstorm.
OTHERFEMALE:Will you be logical? I'd never run nude in the snow.
LEADFEMALE:Well, here's another one.
LEADFEMALE:You were Siamese twins, separated at the head, and she thinks you got the better deal.
SUPFEMALE:Her name was Anathesia, and she's after you like Wait, I hate to interrupt you Hardy Boys in action.
SUPFEMALE:But, Nelson, is it possible that you might have offended somebody in one of your campaign speeches? I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see, my last speech was Wednesday.
SUPFEMALE:Well what did you talk about? Oh, the usual: Nothing.
LEADMALE:Try and remember everything you talked about in that speech.
LEADMALE:Well first I came out for keeping Boulder green.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that'll get the leprechaun vote.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha! But it could antagonize the businessman.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I also came out for green factories.
LEADFEMALE:Did you make a stand on anything? I did say that Boulder should have a monorail system but for safety's sake, it should have two tracks.
SUPFEMALE:And I really was firm on that one.
LEADFEMALE:That's it? I think so.
SUPFEMALE:I did come out against pornography.
OTHERFEMALE:I said that if I were elected, I'd close down every strip joint in this city.
OTHERMALE:Well, how many are there? One.
LEADFEMALE:It opened a couple weeks ago.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's probably it, Nelson.
LEADMALE:One of the strippers must be threatening you.
LEADMALE:( phone rings ) I-if that's for me, I'm not here.
LEADFEMALE:If that's her, I'm gonna tape the conversation.
SUPFEMALE:Answer.
LEADFEMALE:NELSON: I'll answer it, but don't expect me to be polite.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello? ( indistinct speech over phone ) ( phone clicks ) That's fine.
SUPFEMALE:She hung up, let's play it back.
SUPFEMALE:WOMAN ( on tape ): If you don't get out of town, the next bomb's gonna be real.
SUPMALE:And the three of you will be splattered all over Boulder.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mindy, we've gotta get out of here before they make human confetti out of us.
SUPFEMALE:The first thing we have to do is find this woman.
SUPFEMALE:She's gotta be one of the strippers at the Bare Facts Club.
LEADFEMALE:Eh, you can't go.
LEADFEMALE:They'd recognize you because of your eyes.
LEADMALE:Eh, it's up to you and I, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not going into any strip joint.
LEADMALE:Come on, sometimes it's your moral duty to be sleazy, so get your pasties, let's go.
SUPFEMALE:I've got faith in you, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:You could crack this case just like Sam Spade.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what a great detective.
SUPMALE:Too bad he couldn't have puppies.
OTHERFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( air hissing ) Mork, this is so embarrassing.
SUPMALE:Would you look at me? What would my grandmother say if she saw me dressed like this? Take it off.
SUPMALE:As a matter of fact, she would.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you here for the audition? Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Sid Morkenstein, William Morkis Agency.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, darling, more than you'll ever know.
LEADMALE:I represent Miss Mindy Rose Lee.
LEADFEMALE:She's the Boulder Bombshell.
LEADFEMALE:Pleased to meet you.
LEADMALE:I love the balloons, darling.
LEADFEMALE:I bet you don't have a pet porcupine, huh? No, not anymore.
LEADMALE:Does that sound like the voice on the phone? I don't think she knows how to use a phone, Min.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let's move on.
OTHERMALE:Love what you're doing, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:Let's have breakfast, lunch, dinner one day.
SUPFEMALE:Fantastic.
LEADMALE:Hello, Sid Morkenstein, William Morkis Agency, how are you? Love Hey, great-looking bear.
OTHERMALE:Sure am.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I'm in this business.
LEADMALE:So's the kid.
LEADFEMALE:Right, sweetheart? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Sure is a nice place.
LEADFEMALE:It's a lot better than the joints I've been working in.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah What are you talking about? Uh, pardon me, are you interested in politics? No, but I had an old boyfriend once that taught me how to pronounce Zai-air.
SUPMALE:( balloon deflating ) Excuse me.
SUPMALE:I bet you'd be really bummed out if some politician tried to close this place down.
SUPFEMALE:No, there are always places to work.
SUPFEMALE:We move around a lot.
LEADMALE:I hear that.
LEADMALE:But you haven't seen anyone move till you've seen the Boulder Bombshell.
LEADFEMALE:I mean I'm talking about She takes off so much you can see her bones, you know? Ho-ho-ho! Wazoo, wazoo.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha! I'm talking good times here.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, Sid? Can I talk to you for a minute? Oh sure, darling.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:We'll get back to you, I'll put you on hold.
LEADMALE:Love you.
LEADMALE:Knock off this stuff about the audition.
LEADMALE:I'm not getting up there and doing anything.
OTHERMALE:Do you think any of these ladies did it? I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:None of their voices sound familiar.
LEADMALE:And she said that she could get work anywhere, so why would they care if this place closed down? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I've got it.
LEADMALE:The owner of the club is a woman.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha! Maybe.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, girls, let's get this show on the road.
OTHERMALE:I want you to get up here and strut your stuff.
LEADMALE:Mindy, get your struts ready.
OTHERFEMALE:RON: And remember, only the best girl gets to audition for the boss.
SUPMALE:I don't think I can go through with this.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? Nelson would take his clothes off for you.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, you, with the balloons.
LEADFEMALE:You're first.
LEADMALE:Harry, give me a spot.
OTHERMALE:Do you mind? My name is Cherry Balloons, and I did the following number at a recent stag party.
LEADMALE:I got a standing ovation.
LEADMALE:Play something soft and sultry.
LEADMALE:( cabaret piano music playing ) ( balloons popping ) Okay, thanks a lot.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I think we get the idea.
LEADFEMALE:We'll give you a call, okay? Mork, you better get backstage and find out if the owner is a woman before I end up on that stage.
LEADFEMALE:Now, there, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Sid Morkenstein, William Morkis Agency, how are you? Hey, it's a great cigar.
LEADFEMALE:Too bad about Castro, huh? Listen, I've seen better dancing at the New York City Ballet, you know what I'm talking about? Hey.
LEADMALE:You gotta see the Boulder Bombshell there.
LEADMALE:'Cause there is a woman there that I want your boss to see, because when she can move it, she really moves it.
LEADMALE:It must be cream 'cause milk don't flow like that.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey.
SUPMALE:What do you want? Basically I want your boss to see the young woman here.
OTHERMALE:Even blind people go, "Something interesting around there.
LEADMALE:" The boss'll be out when he's ready, you know? All right.
LEADFEMALE:Fantastic, we'll get back to you.
LEADFEMALE:We'll have breakfast, lunch, dinner someday, okay? Yeah, you just wait your turn.

LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Okay, you, you're next.
SUPMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Please play something reeking of innocence.
LEADMALE:( piano playing ) Right.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of an audience do you think we got out here, the Muppets? Well, I refuse to make artistic compromises.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Lex.
SUPMALE:Good luck, kid.
SUPFEMALE:RON: Okay, Bombshell.
LEADMALE:You're next.
LEADMALE:Mork, I can't go up there.
LEADMALE:RON: Come on, what's the matter? You ashamed of your body? No.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, let's see it.
OTHERFEMALE:Wouldn't you rather see his? Come on, I don't have all day.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, come on.
LEADMALE:What kind of music do you want? You don't want no music.
LEADMALE:Play it Acapulco.
SUPMALE:No ( piano playing ) ( inaudible dialogue ) Thanks a lot there, Bombshell.
SUPFEMALE:That was really exciting.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:It isn't fair.
LEADMALE:Her snake's doing a jungle picture, how about that? Now, listen.
SUPMALE:Don't just tell me thanks.
SUPMALE:Get in there and tell your boss that Sid Morkenstein wants to see him, man.
SUPMALE:No one demands to see the boss.
LEADMALE:Hey, well, it was just a request, really, I Um, listen, she had a little stage fright, you know? A little nerves.
LEADMALE:You know how it goes, don't you, sweetheart, don't you? I guess I'll show you how it works.
LEADMALE:Hit it, son.
OTHERFEMALE:( piano playing cabaret music ) Eh, all right, all right, all right.
LEADMALE:I ain't crazy about your act, but maybe the boss might like it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, boss, come on out here.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks, Mr.
SUPMALE:DeMille.
SUPFEMALE:Oh that's the boss.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, I think our little hunch was wrong.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you sweetheart, darling.
LEADMALE:Have your service call my service.
LEADMALE:What it was.
LEADMALE:Heh-heh! Beautiful day, great energy for the room.
SUPFEMALE:( high-pitched voice ): All right, Ron, what's going on out here? She's our man, Min.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) I wanna thank you two for preventing the untimely demise of a future city councilman.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, we're just a couple of courageous kids.
SUPFEMALE:Weren't you scared in that strip joint? Are you kidding? Mindy McConnell knows how to handle herself.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I was really amazed.
LEADFEMALE:The police came and arrested that guy.
LEADMALE:I'll never forget his last words too.
LEADFEMALE:( high-pitched voice ): "How'd you know it was me?" There's no place in this country for soprano terrorism.
SUPMALE:Did you look nice in your costume? Pretty nice.
SUPMALE:Oh, real nice.
OTHERFEMALE:And she got a ride home in a big Cadillac with a man with a wide-brimmed hat.
SUPFEMALE:This whole ugly business has taught me a very valuable lesson.
LEADMALE:I'm never gonna make a stand on anything again.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you'll make a perfect vice president.
LEADMALE:And I'm gonna be a lot more careful now that I know that people are out to get me.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't be paranoid.
SUPMALE:Next you'll say people are trying to poison your food.
SUPMALE:Eat your sandwich.
LEADMALE:Uh um What do you think? We're gonna poison you? Eat it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not hungry right now.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'll taste it for you, Nelson.
SUPMALE:There we go.
SUPFEMALE:Not bad.
LEADFEMALE:( screaming ) Mork! Mork, what's wrong? Too much mustard.
SUPFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( mystical theme playing ) Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson, come in Orson.
SUPFEMALE:ORSON: Here I am, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, coming in loud and clear, O Great Seam-Stretcher.
LEADFEMALE:Let's dispense with the niceties, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:What did you learn this week? Well, why tell you, when I can show you? Hit it.
LEADMALE:( cabaret piano music playing ) What are you doing, Mork? Well, sir, it's what Earthlings call a striptease.
LEADMALE:You wouldn't believe this, but some humans will pay money to watch other humans take off their clothes.
SUPMALE:You mean that Earthlings would pay to watch me undress? There's a difference between a striptease and a strip threat.
OTHERMALE:Speaking of threats, sir, some humans will use threats of physical violence to get their own way.
LEADFEMALE:That's terrible.
LEADMALE:Indeed it is, because it makes other humans afraid to voice their own opinion.
SUPFEMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:They think it's safer to keep things under their hats.
LEADMALE:Oh, especially their heads.
LEADFEMALE:But I thought Earthlings prized their freedom of speech very highly, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Well, they do, sir.
LEADFEMALE:But only a few are willing to pay the price to keep it.
SUPFEMALE:Until next week, sir.
LEADMALE:Nanu, nanu.
