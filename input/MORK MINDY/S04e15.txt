SUPFEMALE:No-no, na-no.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Your Oral Fixationship.
SUPMALE:Orson's gonna love this report.
OTHERMALE:Ha, ha.
OTHERMALE:No, he won't.
OTHERMALE:He's gonna hate it.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't get this report past a white defensive back.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, what do I say to him? Well, Orson will buy anything as long as I make him believe that he's thin for a very brief moment.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:All right, here goes nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERMALE:- Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:- Hi.
SUPFEMALE:- Ready to go? - Oh, not now, little pooter.
LEADMALE:I have to make my report to Orson.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You've had all week to do that.
OTHERFEMALE:I got off work early so we could take Mearth clothes shopping.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, talk to Orson later.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on now, Mind, he relies upon me to keep him aware of the late-breaking events and technological advancements and miraculous breakthroughs.
LEADMALE:Oh, what's your report on? Ants.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mearth, we're going.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mind, we can't go unless you write me another "Please excuse Mork" note.
LEADMALE:- Come on, Mork - Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.
LEADMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm so glad we're going.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, it's getting late.
SUPMALE:Let's go, let's go.
SUPMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Oh my gosh, let's go.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought kids were supposed to hate to go clothes shopping.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we'd have to drag him out of here kicking and screaming.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so did I.
LEADMALE:That's why I told him we were going to the circus.
OTHERMALE:This is a joke, and I'm the butt of it.
LEADMALE:Mearth, don't be Now, don't be like that.
LEADMALE:I think you look very handsome.
LEADMALE:- Doesn't he, Daddy? - Yes.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:What does he know? He promised to take me to the circus.
OTHERMALE:That's what your Mommy told me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, uh, sir.
LEADMALE:We're ready to be altered.
LEADMALE:Altered? Like Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Simmons' cat? I don't want him moping around the house all day and then laying on the TV.
SUPFEMALE:So, what do you think? That fits like a glove.
LEADMALE:You've gotta be You know, you can wear that home.
LEADMALE:You've gotta be putting me on.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, look at this.
SUPMALE:- The shoulders need to be taken in.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, sure, yeah, okay.
LEADMALE:And sleeves can go up.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, sleeves here? - Here? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:- The buttons can be moved over.
LEADMALE:- All right.
OTHERFEMALE:And, uh, don't forget to erase the chalk marks when you're done.
SUPFEMALE:She acts like she's your mother.
SUPFEMALE:She does, doesn't she? I can't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:Look at all these scribbly marks he put all over me.
SUPMALE:I feel like some kind of rotten subway.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know something? Mother's Day is coming up.
LEADFEMALE:I believe it's in May, and I just canceled your present.
LEADMALE:Mearth, I told you I told you we were going clothes shopping, and that's what we're doing, and that's final.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, how about a sailor suit? You can't go anywhere in a sailor suit.
OTHERMALE:Donald Duck does.
LEADMALE:He's right, Mind, and Donald Duck doesn't have to wear pants.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you see if they have any suspenders? You could use a pair.
LEADMALE:I don't need them now.
OTHERMALE:I'm waiting for Emmett Kelly's garage sale.
SUPMALE:Remember that tie I knitted you? I could make you a pair of suspenders to match.
SUPFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:It never hurts to browse.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Come with me.
LEADMALE:Morning.
OTHERMALE:I knew it.
SUPFEMALE:You can always tell by the part.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thank you for inviting me to your barbecue, sir, and I'll be right back.
SUPMALE:I think I forgot the potato salad.
SUPFEMALE:I'm tired of waiting for your report.
LEADMALE:Do you have it or did your neighbor's dog eat it again? Are you kidding, sir? Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Clutch with no report? Come on now, I had a real winner for you, but I decided to expand my perspective and go for a subject of broader scope.
SUPMALE:Sir.
LEADMALE:Sir, I'd tell it to you, but it's a little hard to articulate while I'm being roasted.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, sir.
LEADFEMALE:The report this week, sir, will make you laugh, it'll make you cry, it'll become part of you.
LEADFEMALE:Because today, I tied Mearth's shoes.
OTHERFEMALE:Where did I put my lighter? Come on now, have mercy.
LEADMALE:Listen, I know my reports recently have been about as interesting - as a PTA newsletter, but please - Silence! You're not fulfilling your mission on Earth.
LEADMALE:The scope of your reports is becoming alarmingly narrow.
LEADMALE:You've been letting your wife and son interfere with your responsibilities to Ork.
SUPMALE:I've had enough! You will eliminate all contact with your family unit.
LEADFEMALE:Come on now, sir, I can't.
SUPMALE:I mean, they need me.
SUPMALE:I'm head of the household, king of the castle.
SUPFEMALE:MC of the home version of Hollywood Squares.
OTHERFEMALE:From now on, Mork, concentrate on yourjob and put your family aside.
LEADMALE:Never, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, I can cope with being tied to a stake.
LEADMALE:I can cope with being burned.
SUPFEMALE:But I will never forget my family.
LEADFEMALE:Wanna bet? When I get done with you, the only thing you'll remember about Earth is not to stick a fork in the toaster.
SUPFEMALE:For sure, totally.
LEADMALE:For sure.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Boxing has been good to me, Howard.
LEADFEMALE:Aah, ow.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Greetings, I'm Mork from Ork, na-no.
LEADMALE:This may sound clich√© but will you take me to your leader? Se habla Yiddish? That takes care of the suit, but to tell you the truth, I don't have the strength to go on for the shoes.
SUPMALE:Let's just call it a day, Mork, okay? How do you know my name, Earthling? Oh, give me a break.
SUPFEMALE:Can I just have the checkbook, please? I can't.
SUPMALE:Our planets don't have trade agreements, but will you take me to your leader? Are you putting me on? Oh, I can't.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid you wouldn't fit.
LEADMALE:Mork.
SUPMALE:The meanie tailor must have dropped at least 50 pins in my pants.
OTHERFEMALE:I feel like I've got prickly heat.
SUPMALE:Na-no, I'm Mork from Ork.
SUPMALE:Come on, Dad, I'm Mearth, your son.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, then I must be a moon.
LEADMALE:Aah.
LEADMALE:Mommy, has he been nipping on the ginger ale again? No, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:I think your dad is having a little memory problem.
LEADMALE:I think we better go home right now.
OTHERMALE:Okay, the suit will be ready in a couple of months, maybe.
LEADMALE:Will that be cash or a charge? - Oh, do you accept a charge? - Oh, gladly.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADMALE:Suit'll be ready on Tuesday, huh? - Come on.
SUPMALE:- But where are you taking me? - Home.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, but we just met.
LEADFEMALE:Shouldn't we have a drink first? I'll still respect you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Earth primitive.
LEADMALE:Just like a museum without the overpriced gift shop.
LEADMALE:- Now will you take me to your leader? - I keep telling you, you don't wanna meet our leader.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Mork, look around.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you recognize this place? I mean, you live here with me and Mearth.
OTHERMALE:- Who's Mearth? - Me, your son.
SUPFEMALE:Remember, the guy that carries all the heavy stuff around the house? And I'm your wife.
LEADFEMALE:We're married.
LEADMALE:Married? No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:We Orkans never marry.
LEADMALE:And besides, I would never marry a species who'd make Don Ho rich.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, something has happened to you to make you forget your life on Earth.
LEADFEMALE:Here, sit down.
SUPMALE:I think maybe I can help you to remember.
LEADMALE:Oh, gladly.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, I can't go through this again.
LEADMALE:Daddy, Daddy, that's way off.
LEADFEMALE:Here, turn around.
LEADFEMALE:Here, you sit just like this: - Like I do.
LEADFEMALE:- Kay-o.
LEADFEMALE:Ah! Oh, all the blood is rushing to my feet.
LEADFEMALE:If we're not married, why are we wearing matching rings? Perhaps you like the same cereal.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:It's because we made a commitment to spend the rest of our lives together.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute there, whoa.
LEADMALE:Getting a little too intense now.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know what your game is, lady, but I'm not staying around here.
LEADFEMALE:Not gonna stay till some hunchback goes, "Quick, we must do this," and puts my brain in a jar.
OTHERMALE:- Wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:- No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Mork! Mork, we're not trying to hurt you.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, we're not trying to hurt you, we love you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mommy looks like I'm, uh, the man of the house now.
SUPMALE:Sort of looks that way, doesn't it, sweetheart? Mm-hm.
SUPMALE:Fix dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy? Mork? Shh! Down on your knees.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you recognize Sebal, god of humidity? I sure do.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:When it's his birthday, we're out of school.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Come with me.
SUPMALE:Come on over here.
SUPMALE:This is the seat of honor.
SUPMALE:Right here, right here.
SUPFEMALE:Sit right down there.
OTHERMALE:And just think.
LEADMALE:Mork from Ork, this was your life.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, if I'd only known, I would have done something special to my hair.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Mork, you've had a very interesting life.
SUPMALE:You spent a typical Orkan boyhood in a nursing home, complaining about the food and the sing-alongs.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, to be young and senile again.
SUPMALE:- "Soon it was on to Chester A School for Boys, where you were voted most likely to wear wool.
OTHERMALE:You were sent to Earth to observe.
LEADFEMALE:There you met a beautiful, small-nosed woman.
LEADMALE:" Listen.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, I'll never forget the day we exchanged our vows.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, Orson turned you into a dog? And for weeks you kept sneaking out for Gaines-Burgers.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Do you recognize that voice? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Is it Ella Fitzgerald? Phew.
SUPMALE:Ahem.
LEADFEMALE:No, silly, that's Mom.
SUPMALE:Mom? Is Moms Mabley here? No.
OTHERMALE:It's Mindy McConnell.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's you again.
LEADFEMALE:You look great.
LEADMALE:I can't believe anybody as foxy as you isn't married already.
SUPFEMALE:I am married, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:I'm married to you.
SUPFEMALE:Think about it, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:- Mork - Oh, that'll be a lot easier this way.
LEADFEMALE:Try to think of the good times.
LEADMALE:Think of all the fun we've had and the laughs.
LEADMALE:Think about this, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Who do you call your little pooter? Is my old shop teacher here, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bromex? No, he's not here.
LEADMALE:Oh, go ahead, Mearth.
LEADMALE:"And so, with your blushing bride, you inherited a wonderful family.
LEADFEMALE:" Listen.
LEADFEMALE:Fredzo, wait.
LEADFEMALE:You're not supposed to go out until I say my line.
LEADMALE:How come you got a line and I didn't? Oh, you're such a wiener.
SUPMALE:Oh! This is ridiculous.
SUPMALE:- Dad.
LEADMALE:- Hi.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bromex! Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Bromex, it really is you.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mork, it's Dad.
OTHERMALE:Fred McConnell and Grandma Cora.
SUPMALE:Look at them, Mork, and concentrate.
SUPMALE:Oh, isn't she a little young for him? Honey Come here, honey.
LEADMALE:Now, every now and then we're given a second chance, and when that opportunity comes along, you gotta be smart enough to know how to take advantage of it.
SUPFEMALE:Now, look, I'll go warm up the car, we'll take Mork out for a little ride and we'll drop him off.
LEADFEMALE:Say, in, uh, a silo in South Dakota.
SUPFEMALE:- Grandma, he's doing it again.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Fred, lay off.
SUPFEMALE:Now, the kids are very happy.
LEADMALE:Happy? He doesn't even know who she is.
LEADFEMALE:- Dad - Please, please, please.
LEADFEMALE:We'll have time to talk about all this at the party after the show.
LEADFEMALE:Will you take your seats? Take your seats, please.
SUPFEMALE:The couch, two chairs.
SUPMALE:Will you take yours, please? Thank you, thank you.
SUPMALE:Mork, you've encountered many beings in your travels, but none as eccentric as this next person.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, is that you? Exidor, is that you? He remembers! He remembers.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, this is a red-letter day.
LEADMALE:You've got your memory back, and I'm finally gonna meet Moms Mabley.
LEADFEMALE:Exidor, it's so good to see you.
LEADMALE:I mean, I was getting really lonely having no one to really talk to.
LEADMALE:Ask him more questions so that he remembers more.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:I owe him $10.
SUPMALE:I'll cover it.
LEADFEMALE:In that case, he owes me 20.
LEADMALE:- Mindy, I have a full tank of gas.
LEADMALE:- Good.
OTHERMALE:I'll get you a match.
SUPMALE:I've got it.
LEADMALE:I know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:The solution is as simple and plain as the nose on Pepe's face.
OTHERFEMALE:Hypnosis.
LEADMALE:All I need is a gold watch.
OTHERFEMALE:- Hey! - Here.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Unfortunately, a subject cannot be hypnotized unless he's willing.
SUPFEMALE:Safe! Juanita, you got away with it this time, but don't you ever, ever take that big a lead on the left-handed pitcher again.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork, step into my office.
LEADMALE:- Gladly.
OTHERMALE:Hi, Skeeter.
SUPFEMALE:Working on a little sister for you.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Mork, put your hands in front of your face and repeat after me.
LEADFEMALE:"Oh, no, please don't.
LEADMALE:" All right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, please don't.
LEADFEMALE:Too late.
SUPMALE:That man is an absolute raving lunatic.
SUPMALE:Madam, you flatter me.
LEADFEMALE:- Are you all right? - Who are you? Amazing.
LEADMALE:Total amnesia.
OTHERMALE:All right, get out of my house.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no, thank you very much, but I have to go.
SUPMALE:Tonight is the first Annual Exidor Dance Marathon.
LEADFEMALE:You run 26 miles and then bunny hop across the finish line.
LEADMALE:I don't care what the guy said, I was standing right there and Juanita was out.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess now's as good a time as any.
LEADMALE:Oh, God.
LEADFEMALE:Come in.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't mean to be patronizing, but on Ork we have doorbells.
OTHERMALE:Well, we're a slow but happy people.
LEADFEMALE:Anything on your mind? Well, besides 14 pounds per square inch air pressure, nothing really, except I want to thank you very much for your hospitality this evening, and I'd like to find out what was the name of that dessert we had? Jell-O.
LEADFEMALE:You used to love to eat it in the mornings.
LEADFEMALE:But then you don't remember, do you? What are you doing? Well, whenever I get depressed, I engage in an old Earth custom called cleaning out the closet.
SUPMALE:- Mind if I watch? - No, actually you could help.
SUPFEMALE:- Half of the stuff is yours.
LEADFEMALE:- Ooh.
SUPMALE:Is this mine? No.
LEADMALE:Too bad, it's my color.
LEADMALE:Whoa, ha, ha! Where did you get this stuffed Splock? Was the Orkan carnival passing through here? No.
LEADMALE:You won this for me on our honeymoon.
LEADFEMALE:You won it by throwing lead bottles at a pile of softballs.
LEADFEMALE:Remember? Then we went to the anti-gravity bar to hear your favorite group, Wink Geezba and the Gold Diggers.
LEADMALE:I remembered we danced on air till the suns came up.
SUPMALE:And we went for a little walk on the beach, and you told me I guess it doesn't matter what you told me, does it? Your eyes are leaking.
LEADMALE:It's called crying.
OTHERMALE:Why are you crying? Oh, I'm crying because Because you're here and I miss you.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:What are you doing now? I'm expressing emotion.
LEADMALE:See, on Earth, when people love each other, they do this.
LEADFEMALE:The capital of New York is Albany.
OTHERMALE:What did you say? You have a mole on the bottom of your foot shaped like Scatman Crothers.
LEADMALE:Oh! I'm about to remember something really important now.
SUPMALE:- About us? - No.
SUPMALE:That Italian restaurants are closed on Mondays.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh! The memory dam is breaking! It's all coming back to me now.
SUPMALE:But I need some help.
LEADMALE:Now I know I I can remember everything except all the teams in the National Hockey League.
LEADMALE:We better try once more.
LEADMALE:I finally remembered what I wanted to say to you.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, what? - I love you.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork Oh, Mork, I was so scared.
LEADMALE:What happened to you? Where have you been? When? - When you got amnesia.
LEADMALE:- Oh, I was trying to forget that, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:You know You know what happened? Orson got a little mad at me, and, well, he closed my account in the memory bank.
OTHERFEMALE:- Why? - Well, see, I've been spending so much time with you and Mearth that Well, I've been neglecting my job.
LEADMALE:And he thinks I'm a bad observer.
SUPFEMALE:I keep forgetting that what you do is a real important job.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it's not like you get a W-2 form or you have a pension plan.
LEADFEMALE:And you get paid in sand.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but it's still my job, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:I've blown it.
SUPMALE:See, I've even let my subscription to Ebony run out.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we'll just have to renew that.
OTHERFEMALE:And also, we're gonna have to make sure that you spend as much time as you need to make your job a good one.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, you're gonna be the best observer Ork ever had.
LEADMALE:Even better than Andy Rooney? Yes.
LEADMALE:And neater too.
LEADMALE:Just one more shot for old time's sake.
SUPFEMALE:I remember our phone number now.
LEADMALE:It's all coming back to me.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Dad.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, wait, wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:I've got some great news.
SUPMALE:Mork remembers.

LEADMALE:Well, he likes you.
SUPFEMALE:Talk to you later.
SUPMALE:Goodbye.
OTHERMALE:You know Lady.
OTHERMALE:Lady, it's happening again.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, no.
SUPMALE:- I'm losing it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm fading back into the distance.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:All I can remember is one word.
LEADFEMALE:Big kiss.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.

LEADMALE:And now for the fast-breaking news of Earth.
LEADFEMALE:Reported with keen insight and renewed vigor, plus greetings from the McConnell clan.
LEADFEMALE:- You remember your family? - Of course, sir.
LEADFEMALE:I'd better check the warranty on that memory helmet.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it works fine, sir, but nothing can make me forget those that I love.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course, you must keep in mind your responsibilities too.
SUPMALE:Allow me to demonstrate, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Notice, while I am balancing this ball, I am also carrying on a serious conversation with you.
OTHERMALE:Fascinating illustration.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
LEADMALE:I'm concentrating on the ball.
LEADFEMALE:That's the point I want to make, sir.
