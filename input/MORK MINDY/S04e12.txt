LEADFEMALE:Na-no, na-no.
SUPFEMALE:Only my husband would buy out the entire airport gift shop in his own hometown.
LEADFEMALE:Will you take off the silly hat? You look like a character from Tumbleweeds.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, Mind.
LEADMALE:I had to do something though.
LEADFEMALE:I really miss our little bouncing baby-man.
LEADFEMALE:I do too.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna miss Mearth.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, but it's good for him to be with Dad in Florida.
LEADMALE:Just think, they'll camp out, sleep under the stars, swat mosquitoes.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:- That's how Deliverance started.
LEADMALE:- Heh.
OTHERMALE:It'll be a good experience for him.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, you know, we could really use the time together.
LEADFEMALE:You think about it, Mork, the baby was born as soon as we got married.
OTHERMALE:We never had an opportunity to spend time together as just husband and wife.
LEADMALE:I'm still gonna miss the little buggerpoo.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Sneaking around with his Polaroid, trying to take pictures of us - in compromising positions.
OTHERMALE:- Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I'm gonna miss waking up to, "Mommy, how come you look so different in the morning?" And when I go to the park, who's gonna push me on the swing? Boy, listen to us.
LEADMALE:I think there's more to our marriage than just being parents.
SUPFEMALE:Just think, we can spend a whole week together, just the two of us.
OTHERMALE:You got any ideas? Well, there's an exciting new series on TV where the Osmond Family plays the Donner Party.
SUPMALE:I think we can do better than sitting around watching television.
LEADMALE:I really had something a little more exciting and exotic in mind.
LEADMALE:Well, we could buy a parrot.
LEADFEMALE:And teach it to talk dirty.
LEADMALE:Mind, come on, I was kidding.
LEADMALE:You know what I'm talking about.
LEADMALE:I know we're a couple of vibrant young people that wear trendy clothes.
LEADMALE:You know, the world belongs to us and the OPEC nations.
LEADFEMALE:- You smooth talker, you.
SUPFEMALE:- Mm Mm-hm-hm-hm.
OTHERMALE:- Mm.
LEADFEMALE:- Aah! Mork! The telephone.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
OTHERMALE:Shh! Stop it! Hello.
OTHERMALE:Yes, this is Mindy.
SUPMALE:Wait one second, please.
OTHERMALE:Mork, will you stop it? Wait, I'll be off in a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be off in a minute.
OTHERMALE:Shh, shh, shh.
LEADMALE:Hello? Yes, I'm back.
SUPMALE:Now? Yeah, but what about Dewey Fishbeck? Yes, sir.
LEADMALE:Okay, I'll be right over.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Oh, God.
OTHERMALE:Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:This isn't the way I wanted to start our week, but I've gotta go meet the camera crew.
LEADMALE:A used car dealer's been kidnapped, and nobody wants to pay the ransom.
LEADFEMALE:- Or cover the story.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, look, I understand, Mind.
LEADMALE:Business before pleasure.
SUPFEMALE:But don't worry, tonight when you come home, I'll give you Magic.
LEADFEMALE:And if I can't get him, I'll get Kareem.
LEADMALE:Ha.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? No.
LEADMALE:You know the words to this song.
LEADMALE:My boyfriend's back And there's gonna be trouble My boyfriend's back Mork, are the Arafats coming for bridge? No, no, Mind, I would like to welcome you to the wonderful world of Middle-Eastern cuisine.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome to Moroccafeller Center.
LEADMALE:If you're very nice to me, I might be able to get you your passport back.
LEADFEMALE:This is great.
SUPMALE:Everything looks so Moroccan.
LEADMALE:The pillows.
LEADFEMALE:Your falafel outfit.
LEADMALE:And the music.
LEADMALE:Yes, I taped it off this great Middle-Eastern station, K-FEZ.
LEADMALE:Talk about 16 with a bullet.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, Mork, you went to all this trouble.
LEADMALE:I feel like I should go to the river and do our laundry.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind, don't be afraid, because I have made you an incredible, original Moroccan meal.
SUPMALE:Totally traditional because I went out and begged for the ingredients.
OTHERFEMALE:Sit down.
SUPFEMALE:- There we go.
LEADMALE:- This how I'm supposed to sit? Well, that is if you're Yogi Berra.
LEADMALE:"Yo, right in there.
SUPFEMALE:" We must begin, first of all, by the traditional washing of the hands, which is traditional in most Moroccan meals and some Moroccan surgery.
LEADFEMALE:Dip your hands in there.
SUPFEMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:- Feels like dishwashing liquid.
LEADFEMALE:- It is, and you're soaking in it.
SUPMALE:There we go.
SUPMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:And now we must do the feet.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not gonna eat with my feet.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Damn, there goes dessert.
LEADMALE:- Mork, just sit down.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's talk.
LEADMALE:- All right, my dear.
OTHERMALE:My little macaroon.
SUPMALE:Mork, I love that you did this for me.
LEADMALE:- Oh - You know Oh, we'll have time for some chat later, but first, I must serve you the first course, the traditional Moroccan appetizer.
SUPFEMALE:Hold on and I will see, I will try to pronounce it for you.
LEADMALE:Let's see if I can pronounce it.
OTHERMALE:Fruit cocktail.
LEADMALE:What's Moroccan about that? Well, when I opened the can, it went: A little Slim Whitman.
SUPMALE:You're gonna love the next course.
SUPMALE:Couscous and mahi-mahi.
LEADFEMALE:I got the recipe from Lu-Lu in Walla Walla.
LEADFEMALE:How she got the recipe, I'll never know-know-know.
OTHERMALE:Um, there's no silverware.
LEADMALE:We're supposed to eat with our fingers? Yes, because all the silverware is used in Morocco to tunnel out of prison.
SUPFEMALE:First of all, you must take some of this.
SUPFEMALE:And Be careful there.
LEADFEMALE:Don't dip in the food.
LEADMALE:You can dip, but don't dip.
SUPMALE:Take a piece of this and take some And put some of that in there like this.
LEADFEMALE:And then you savor the taste.
OTHERMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:Heh-heh.
SUPMALE:- Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:- Mm.
SUPFEMALE:It's so hard to get fresh camel lips in Boulder, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:- Ooh.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh - You know, Mork, I have a confession.
LEADFEMALE:- What, Mind? I was afraid that with Mearth gone we wouldn't have anything to talk about.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, we'll have plenty of things to talk about, but after this.
LEADMALE:- Oh, what? - Ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:You'll see.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:- Who is that? - Oh, sorry.
LEADMALE:Fatima, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Mindy, Fatima.
LEADMALE:I would have gotten a snake-charmer, but his kid was having a Bar Mitzvah.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, it's different.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, it is.
LEADMALE:Not what I expected.
LEADFEMALE:I think she wants to dance with you, Mind.
LEADMALE:Uh, well, you go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:My navel jewel's off being appraised.
SUPFEMALE:It won't be the same effect without a halter top.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh Oh.
LEADMALE:Round two.
LEADFEMALE:You and Fatima chat.
SUPMALE:Maybe you can ask where she got these wonderful clothes.
LEADMALE:You dance really well.
LEADMALE:You know, Casablanca was my favorite film.
LEADFEMALE:Specialty of the house, - the shish kebab.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Or in the very elegant restaurants, "shish ke-Robert.
SUPMALE:" Since the beginning, we must have some more spices, a little brandy there.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-mm-mm.
LEADMALE:You can never have too much of this on there, huh? Yeah, now, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Is that supposed to be on fire? Well, it's kind of academic, Mind, because it is now.
LEADFEMALE:- Looks kind of hot.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, don't panic.
LEADMALE:I know how to deal with this.
SUPMALE:Don't panic at all.
LEADMALE:Fire! Fire! Mind, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't make a mess, hon.
OTHERMALE:There.
LEADFEMALE:Well - It's all right now.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah, it's all right.
LEADFEMALE:Next time, you schlep to Moroccan Town and barter with the man with one tooth going, "You must buy this.
OTHERMALE:You must buy this.
OTHERMALE:" Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry I ruined our perfect evening, Mind.
LEADMALE:I'm just tragedy's pawn.
LEADFEMALE:I feel like an outer space Eddie Fisher.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, it was no tragedy.
OTHERFEMALE:Nobody was hurt.
SUPFEMALE:You call burning up lamb at $9 a pound no tragedy? Believe me, there are worse things in life.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you feel that way, Mindy, because I think Fatima danced out of here with our toaster oven.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork, I love what you tried to do.
LEADFEMALE:- But now the fire's out, - Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:- And Fatima's out, - Mm.
LEADMALE:And we're alone.
LEADMALE:Ah, you're right.
LEADMALE:We don't need external stimuli.
LEADFEMALE:We can make our own chemistry, huh? We'll have our own little Fourth of July without the vandalism.
SUPMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:Mm.
SUPFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Hm.
SUPFEMALE:You know that something Oh, no, you go Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh - Oh, no, go ahead.
SUPMALE:- Oh, no, you.
LEADFEMALE:I insist.
LEADFEMALE:Well, all right, I'll go.
LEADMALE:You know, there's something that's been bugging me - ever since I landed on Earth.
SUPMALE:- What? You know that song "This Old Man"? When he hits 12, what's he play knick-knack on? You actually wonder about things like that? You know when you get a song in your head Boing, boing, boing, boing.
LEADMALE:- I don't know.
OTHERMALE:- Oh.
OTHERMALE:Well, me too.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Catchy song, isn't it? Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:- Ow, this is great! - Great? We haven't said a word.
LEADMALE:No, look, I found a bicentennial quarter.
LEADMALE:- That's wonderful, Mind.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Mork, this is silly.
LEADFEMALE:Look at us.
LEADMALE:We're as uncomfortable as a pair of teenagers on a blind date.
LEADFEMALE:We must have something to talk about.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what do you want me to say, Mind? Well, I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:Anything.
SUPFEMALE:Ask me how work was.
LEADFEMALE:All right, how was work? Somebody parked in my parking place today.
LEADMALE:Boy, that's life in the big city, huh? Want me to ask how your lunch was? Oh, no.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not supposed to have to ask what to ask.
LEADFEMALE:- We're having a conversation.
LEADMALE:- Oh, no, Mind.
OTHERMALE:I mean, besides, I didn't know I have to ask what I have to ask when I don't know what I wanna ask when I wanna ask it.
SUPFEMALE:So now you're getting defensive? I'm not getting defensive.
LEADMALE:You're out of line.
SUPMALE:Mork, what's wrong with a husband and wife trying to have a conversation? I mean, look, our lives have been moving so fast.
SUPMALE:We haven't had a chance to talk about hardly anything.
SUPFEMALE:- Like what? - Well, like All right, for example, you've never said whether you like being married or not.
LEADMALE:- I do.
SUPMALE:- Well, why? - Well, lots of reasons.
OTHERFEMALE:- Well, give me one.
SUPMALE:Well, all right.
SUPFEMALE:- The bed's warmer.
LEADMALE:- Oh, that's it.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, if you wanted snappy repartee, you should have married William F.
SUPMALE:Buckley.
SUPFEMALE:"I find the institution of marriage quite appealing.
LEADMALE:" I'm sorry, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:I love you.
SUPMALE:Well, why? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, because you're warm and sensitive and unpredictable.
LEADFEMALE:And you're right, the bed is warmer.
SUPMALE:Now, don't you have something you'd like to say to me? - Yes.
LEADMALE:- What? You have a big piece of couscous in your teeth.
OTHERMALE:Can't you be serious for a minute? I just opened up to you.
OTHERMALE:- Can't you tell me how you feel? - Oh, you already know that.
LEADMALE:- I'd like to hear it.
LEADMALE:- I'm sure you would.
LEADFEMALE:Probably right now, maybe? Oh, okay, just give me a micro-bleam here.
SUPMALE:It's just a Shelf! - Shelf? - That's it, Mind.
OTHERMALE:This old man, he plays 12 He hits knick-knack on my shelf All right, that's it.
LEADMALE:Just forget it.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, who is not communicating now, Miss Marshall McLuhan? Well, what's the point in communicating with someone - who's got nothing to say? - Oh, maybe I would if I wasn't being interrogated by the Boulder Gestapo.
LEADFEMALE:- Gestapo? - Yeah, and I haven't even started yet.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you've got a lot of nerve calling me names, space boy.
OTHERMALE:Oh, to the moon, Alice! Well, I've got something I'd like to say to you.
LEADFEMALE:Shiksa! Oh, if you think Oh, Mind? I've cooled off now, hon.
SUPMALE:I'm really cooled off now, hon, because I'm locked out.
SUPMALE:Honey? Little pooterama? Ha-ha-ha.
SUPMALE:Fun's fun, hon.
LEADFEMALE:The bed's not gonna be as warm.
LEADMALE:Be careful.
SUPFEMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, couple more steps.
SUPFEMALE:Watch out there.
LEADFEMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:You look like you're on What's My Line? Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, that's all right.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, take one step up.
LEADMALE:Take a step up.
LEADFEMALE:There we go, one step up.
LEADMALE:Now, when you open your eyes, you're not gonna be mad at me anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? Well, we'd better be in Paris.
LEADMALE:Well, take one step forward, two steps to the left, and you're gonna be at the greatest place on earth, next to Burt Reynolds' Dinner Theatre in Jupiter, Florida.
LEADMALE:- Where are we? - Come on, Mind, what are you, blind? Oh.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:Boy, Mind, how about this for a blast from the past, huh? Well, don't you know where we are? Well, wait.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, imagine there are no walls here, the snow has melted, and there are beer cans over there - shimmering in the full moon.
OTHERFEMALE:- Mork, where are we? All right, I'll give you another hint.
LEADMALE:Sounds like the place we first met.
SUPMALE:- Here? - No, no, here.
LEADFEMALE:There was a rock that says, "Chi-Chi Loves Lumpy.
LEADMALE:" - Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, now I remember.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You had your suit on backwards.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I almost choked to death trying to tie the tie.
LEADFEMALE:- Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you were a priest.
SUPFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I was just glad that your mouth was on your face.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, I feel a sudden flood of emotions.
LEADMALE:I feel just like a salmon.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Why don't you take a picture? It lasts longer.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? Yo! Yaddy-yaddy-yadda.
LEADFEMALE:- Roofers.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:Mork, thanks for the sentimental journey to the past, but let's go home.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, we can't leave.
OTHERMALE:I mean, it's too important.
LEADMALE:We don't wanna end up like the League of Nations.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you can't honestly believe that just by coming back to a place like this, - it can change anything.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, yes, I do.
SUPMALE:Knock it off, for crying out loud! Show some decorum around here.
LEADMALE:Shut up! I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really sorry, folks.
LEADFEMALE:Please, I apologize.
LEADMALE:Try to excuse the fellas.
LEADMALE:It's just that they're not romantics, you know, like myself.
LEADFEMALE:Just last week, I, uh I bought my wife a cappuccino machine.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we didn't mean to barge in.
LEADMALE:In fact, we were just leaving.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're not the couple that's buying this place? - No.
SUPFEMALE:- On her salary? Are you kidding? Heh.
LEADMALE:Arg, arg.
LEADMALE:Looky-loos, huh? No, actually, this is the place where we first met when it was all still wilderness.
LEADFEMALE:- Really? - Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:- But we are just gonna be on our way.
LEADFEMALE:- Leave? No! You can't leave now and ruin this beautiful warm moment.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:I won't hear of it.
SUPMALE:But we do have a little bit of an insurance problem here.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Luke, give me a couple of hard hats down here.
SUPFEMALE:One for you, pal.
LEADMALE:There we go.
OTHERFEMALE:One for the lady.
LEADMALE:Mam'selle, here you are.
LEADFEMALE:I might say you look divine in green.
LEADFEMALE:Come on now, tell me, how did you two meet? Oh, well, you know, typical stuff, boy meets girl Come on, you can tell me.
LEADFEMALE:We're like old friends now.
SUPFEMALE:- No, I don't wanna.
SUPFEMALE:It's dumb.
LEADMALE:- No, it's not, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you see, she was out with this creep and then he dumped her - and he took off in her jeep.
SUPFEMALE:- That's not true.
SUPMALE:He I happened to dump him.
OTHERFEMALE:He just took my jeep.
LEADFEMALE:See, that's the part where I came in.
LEADFEMALE:I was sent to Earth to observe, and my eggship landed, well, about 40 feet over there.
LEADFEMALE:Then I came out with my suit on backwards and I said: And then I met her and, you know, then we started living together and we recently got married and a month ago my son was just hatched.
LEADMALE:- Oh-ho-ho.
LEADFEMALE:- That's nothing.
LEADMALE:You wanna hear a real story? I just wanna tell you how I first met Mitzi.
LEADMALE:All right? I was at Petaluma, right? You know, for the arm-wrestling tournaments.
LEADFEMALE:Turned around one day and there she was, Mitzi.
LEADMALE:Like a vision, like a Venus de Milo in a Harley-Davidson T-shirt.
SUPFEMALE:And she pinned that other chick in five seconds flat.
LEADMALE:Broke her wrist.
SUPMALE:Heh.
SUPFEMALE:That's a beautiful story.
LEADFEMALE:Sure beats the sap out of mine.
OTHERFEMALE:I gotta get back to work.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, you kids stay here as long as you want.
LEADMALE:You understand? You know, enjoy yourself.
LEADMALE:Okay, bye.
LEADFEMALE:I might just go two out of three with Mitzi tonight.
LEADFEMALE:She'll let me win.
OTHERMALE:She always does.
SUPMALE:She's crazy about me.
OTHERMALE:Well, who wouldn't be? Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:How could you tell a total stranger where you're really from? Oh, Mind, loose-lips moi.
OTHERMALE:I'm so muddled and confused recently, I feel like a Vietnamese child adopted by a Southern family.
LEADMALE:I know, I've been feeling badly too.
SUPMALE:I just can't seem to make things get together for us, Mind.
LEADMALE:I mean, what am I doing wrong? I don't know, Mork.
LEADMALE:If I did, I'd tell you.
SUPMALE:You know how to do origami and you don't know how to do this? I wonder what makes it so hard.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you think about it, it was never easy.
OTHERMALE:I mean, once you shrunk to the size of a beer nut.
LEADMALE:I've been cloned, and on our wedding day, Orson turned you into a dog.
LEADMALE:We've been through almost as much as Loretta Lynn before her sweet 16 party.
LEADFEMALE:If we can get through that, why can't we get through this? I don't know.
LEADMALE:It seems like since we've gotten married, everything seems so much more important.
SUPMALE:- Even our failures.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, Mind, we're not failing.
OTHERMALE:I know what failure means.
LEADFEMALE:I tried to argue with the phone company about a bill once.
OTHERFEMALE:You ever been on hold for a day? Well, I guess we can't expect to know all the answers.
LEADMALE:Just because we're married, we think we're supposed to.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:When I thought we were gonna be alone again, boy, did I panic.
LEADMALE:I know, but at least you tried.
LEADMALE:I just pushed.
LEADFEMALE:I got so uncomfortable.
LEADFEMALE:I kept trying to make you say things I wanted to hear.
SUPMALE:- That isn't us.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:But this is us, isn't it, huh? Oh, Mork, we've got so much going for us.
OTHERFEMALE:We don't need to have exotic dinners or pull crazy stunts to prove that we love each other.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I guess you're right, Mind.
SUPMALE:Eh.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:Won't be needing these.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, there we go.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, I love you.
LEADMALE:Oh, I love you too, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:And now I finally can say why.
SUPFEMALE:And you look great naked! - Thank you.
LEADMALE:- Oh, now, Mind, you know, relating has its place, but you know what's really nice? Well, it's to sit here, hold hands, - watch the sun set over the wet bar.
SUPMALE:- Heh-heh.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
SUPMALE:Come on, kiss her already.
LEADFEMALE:It's almost Miller time! Aw!
