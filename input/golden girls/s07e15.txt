SUPMALE: Hello? You wanna talk to who? Dorothy? Sorry, you must've dialed the wrong number.
SUPMALE:Blanche, what do you mean, wrong number? Oh, it was a man, so I just assumed  Hello? Yes, this is she.
SUPMALE:I don't believe it! Well Oh, that's great.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you come here? We'll have lunch.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, fine.
LEADMALE:Fine, I'll see you then.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPMALE:Well? Well, what? Oh, now, Dorothy, fess up.
SUPMALE:I know that was a man.
OTHERFEMALE:I can always tell when a man calls 'cause you start sweatin' and get a bad case of the giggles.
LEADFEMALE:I do not.
LEADFEMALE: All right, talk.
LEADMALE:It's no big deal.
LEADMALE:That was my 11th grade English teacher from back in Brooklyn, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Gordon.
SUPMALE:He's moved to Miami, and he wants to get together tomorrow for lunch.
OTHERFEMALE:End of story.
LEADFEMALE: Ah, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Gordon.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy had a huge embarrassing crush on him.
LEADMALE:She was his slave.
LEADFEMALE:She graded his papers, did his laundry.
LEADMALE:Once, she even rotated his tires.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, that stroke didn't make you forget a thing, did it, Ma? A crush on the teacher.
LEADMALE:Ah, I had those.
OTHERFEMALE:Course, I had to hide them because they made the principal jealous.
SUPMALE:Actually, though, once, I did have a fling with the calculus teacher.
LEADMALE:Oh, and did you get an A?  More like a full scholarship to MIT.
OTHERFEMALE:My Dorothy didn't date teachers in high school.
LEADMALE:She dated losers like Stan who knocked her up and ruined her life forever.
LEADFEMALE:It would be like a day without orange juice, wouldn't it, Ma? Girls, guess what? They gave me another job at the television station.
LEADMALE:The old associate producer quit, so now I am the new associate producer of the Wake-Up! Miami show.
LEADFEMALE:They even gave me a nameplate for my desk.
OTHERMALE:"Harold Goldstein, Associate Producer.
OTHERMALE:" Isn't it exciting? Oh, congratulations, Harold.
SUPMALE:That's great.
LEADMALE:We've already had our first meeting.
SUPMALE:I suggested we do a show about women who live together, and they jumped on it.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, Rose, that's a great idea.
SUPMALE:We already have two women lined up.
SUPFEMALE:We just have to find two more.
LEADFEMALE:Why, my God, Rose, open your eyes! This is exactly the kind of exposure I've been lookin' for.
LEADFEMALE:Please, enough of your exposure.
LEADFEMALE:We've already lost three gardeners.
OTHERMALE:No, wait, Dorothy, this is a wonderful idea.
SUPMALE:I mean, you and Blanche live together.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you do the show? Oh, I would love to.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I wouldn't mind doing it.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, there are some very important issues I'd like to discuss.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell.
SUPFEMALE:I'll do it, too.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sorry, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:There's only room for two more guests on the panel.
LEADFEMALE:That's not fair.
LEADFEMALE:Why should I be left out? If I don't do it, Dorothy won't do it.
SUPMALE:So, when do you want me there? Hi, girls.
SUPMALE:Oh, Dorothy, don't you look nice.
SUPMALE:Well, thank you, Rose.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Gordon is coming over for lunch today.
LEADFEMALE:We're having it out on the lanai.
LEADFEMALE:So that's why you're acting like it's the first day of school.
SUPMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Gordon is coming over.
LEADFEMALE: Mother, just stop that.
OTHERFEMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Gordon is probably over 70 by now.
LEADMALE:He's practically ancient.
SUPMALE:Seventy is ancient? If I met a man that age who looked halfway decent, I'd be on my back before you could say, "I've fallen and I can't get up.
SUPMALE:" That's great, Ma.
LEADMALE:That's really beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:But there's nothing like that between me and Mr.
LEADMALE:Gordon.
LEADMALE:If you don't believe me, why don't you join us for lunch? Join you for lunch? Let me check my social calendar.
OTHERFEMALE: Oh, okay, I'm free.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, that calendar's from 1984.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, this is the day I escaped from Shady Pines.
LEADFEMALE:It says right here, "I'm free! I'm free!"  Oh, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Gordon.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, you look wonderful.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, thank you, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Gordon.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, no more of that Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Gordon stuff.
LEADFEMALE:It's Malcolm.
SUPFEMALE:Absolutely, Mr.
LEADMALE:Malcolm.
LEADMALE: Come, meet my roommates.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Blanche, Rose, my mother Sophia, Malcolm Gordon.
SUPMALE:Yeah, of course.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Petrillo.
SUPFEMALE:We met before.
LEADMALE:You were having a problem with my son, Phil.
LEADMALE:Oh, right.
LEADFEMALE:The problem with the dress code.
LEADFEMALE:I still don't understand the problem.
SUPFEMALE:He was wearing a dress.
LEADMALE:My goodness, you're as cute as Dorothy said you'd be.
LEADFEMALE:That never happens.
LEADMALE: Well, a lot of my ex-students were surprised that I wasn't older, but, uh, they failed to realize I started teaching right out of college.
OTHERFEMALE:I really wasn't much older than they were.
OTHERMALE:Well, I--I guess when you're 17, and forbidden.
LEADFEMALE:When you're 17, a cow can seem dangerous and forbidden.
SUPMALE:Am I alone here? Well, uh, why don't we go out to the lanai?  Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't you forget something? Oh, yes, of course.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, Mother.
LEADFEMALE:What? What, goodbye? You invited me to lunch.
LEADMALE:Rain check, rain check.
SUPFEMALE:I think that is a lovely idea, Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Petrillo.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I'll be on my best behavior.
LEADFEMALE:I won't say or do anything to embarrass you.
SUPMALE:Oh, wait.
LEADMALE:Goofy pictures of Dorothy when she was a kid.
SUPMALE:Might as well have a couple of laughs over lunch.
LEADMALE: Oh, here's a picture of Dorothy's ninth birthday party.
SUPFEMALE:Look how scared the clown looks.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I can't believe you actually got a clown for my birthday.
OTHERMALE:I can still see his big red nose and those huge black circles around his eyes.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, he wasn't a real clown.
SUPMALE:He was a friend of your father's.
LEADFEMALE:He'd been beaten up the night before.
LEADFEMALE:We gave him a couple of bucks.
LEADMALE:I guess that's why he kept saying, "Now, remember, kids, nobody likes a squealer.
LEADFEMALE:" Here are some pictures of Dorothy at 11, a hilariously awkward age for her.
LEADMALE: Ma, enough with the pictures.
SUPMALE:Why don't you get us some coffee? 'Cause it gives me the trots.
SUPMALE:Oh, I get it.
LEADFEMALE:Company.
LEADMALE:Company.
OTHERMALE:Pardon me.
LEADFEMALE:She's charming.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you're very kind.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry she bored you with all these old pictures.
LEADFEMALE:Nonsense, I enjoyed it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Look.
SUPMALE:Look, your graduation picture.
OTHERFEMALE:You were such a lovely girl.
OTHERFEMALE: Oh, I never felt that way.
SUPMALE:I always felt awkward and clumsy, except in your class.
OTHERMALE:You made me feel intelligent and beautiful and special.
SUPFEMALE:I never forgot that.
LEADFEMALE:And I have never forgotten you.
LEADFEMALE: So, how do you like being retired? Actually, I intend to work.
SUPFEMALE:I just got my first assignment to write an article for the book review section.
LEADMALE:I'm a little nervous.
SUPMALE:It's due next week.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, now you know how we used to feel when you would assign us a book report.
LEADFEMALE:I remember that crazy excuse you used when you didn't hand your paper in.
OTHERFEMALE:What was it? Oh, that you'd married that kid, Stan, what's his name? Gee, I don't remember.
SUPMALE:I'm having a little trouble getting started.
OTHERMALE:I can't seem to get my thoughts organized.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, maybe you'd like a little help.
LEADMALE:Really? I certainly could use a little.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'd be happy to.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that is great.
LEADFEMALE:We'll start tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:No, I'm doing a TV show tomorrow morning.
LEADFEMALE:A TV show? Well, I'm impressed.
LEADMALE:Well, no, it's just a little old local show, but they're anxious to get my views on women's issues.
LEADMALE:Hey, why don't you come to the studio, and we can start right after? Perfect.
LEADFEMALE:Just perfect.
SUPMALE: Dorothy, to us.
SUPFEMALE:More goofy pictures!  Here's Dorothy in her wedding gown.
SUPFEMALE:Look how scared the groom looks.
LEADMALE: Okay, come on, Blanche.
LEADMALE:You're on in one minute.
LEADFEMALE:You sit over there, and--and, Dorothy, you get touched up, and, Sophia, come on, I'll see if I can find you a seat in the audience.
LEADMALE:Hurry up, honey.
OTHERMALE:Here.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy? Well, you look lovely.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:For your television debut.
OTHERMALE:Oh, they're beautiful.
LEADMALE:Dorothy? Good luck.
LEADMALE:Come on, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:We're starting.
LEADMALE:He kissed me.
LEADMALE:He gave me flowers.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, come on, it's almost time.
LEADFEMALE:Over here, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Please.
LEADMALE:All right, you sit over there.
SUPFEMALE:Down there, that's it.
OTHERFEMALE:What's wrong with her? Malcolm kissed her.
SUPFEMALE:My God, she's in shock.
LEADFEMALE:He gave me flowers from a store.
OTHERMALE:Ladies, good morning.
LEADFEMALE:We go on in about 10 seconds.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! Just relax and have a fun show, okay?  Good morning and welcome to Wake-Up! Miami.
LEADMALE:Today, women who live together.
LEADFEMALE:Does society make it tougher? We'll find out when we talk to four lesbians today on Wake-Up! Miami.
LEADMALE:Rose, could I see you for moment? You're mad, aren't you? Rose Nylund, every man I know is watching this show.
LEADFEMALE:This live show.
LEADMALE:This live show about lesbian lovers of Miami.
LEADFEMALE:Every man you know is watching? Hey, we could beat The Price Is Right.
SUPMALE:Rose, we can't kill you here because there are cameras.
LEADMALE:Now, how did this happen? Oh, I don't know.
SUPMALE:They just said they wanted two women who loved each other and slept together.
LEADMALE:We do not sleep together! Yes, you did.
OTHERFEMALE:Last month, when When Blanche was having her room repainted because the plaster behind her headboard all fell out.
OTHERFEMALE:We're back in 30 seconds, ladies.
LEADMALE:Listen, I'm not gonna do this.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, if you leave, they'll fire me.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:My mother is here.
LEADMALE:My teacher is here.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:If I lose my job, I won't be able to do anything but sit home and tell St.
SUPMALE:Olaf stories.
LEADFEMALE:Blackmail.
SUPMALE:Oh, very smart.
SUPMALE:Hey, they don't call me Harold Goldstein for nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe if we don't say anything, we're not on camera that much.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, we can't let Rose lose her job.
SUPFEMALE: We're back.
LEADFEMALE:Let's meet our panelists.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, a lesbian.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, another lesbian.
LEADFEMALE:And Pat and Kathy, image consultants.
SUPMALE:How come they're not lesbians? We don't believe in labels.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I see we have a question from the audience.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, sir.
LEADMALE:Are there male/female roles in the relationship? Well, I am the little homemaker, if that's what you mean.
SUPFEMALE:Now, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Just  And I take out the garbage.
SUPFEMALE:Fascinating, huh? Any other questions? Ah, here we go.
LEADFEMALE:This is directed to Dorothy's lover.
SUPMALE:Do people treat you differently because you're a lesbian? Well, most people don't know.
LEADMALE:Really? I would've guessed right off.
LEADMALE:Next question to Dorothy.
LEADMALE:What kind of pain and embarrassment has this lifestyle caused your mother? I really don't know, but I'll ask her tomorrow when I visit her at the home.
OTHERMALE:No more questions.
SUPMALE: Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Not one phone call all day.
SUPFEMALE:That's not true, Blanche.
LEADMALE:The phone's been ringing off the hook.
SUPFEMALE:Not one phone call from a man all day, Rose.
LEADMALE:By the way, Dorothy, if I were a lesbian, I sure would be a popular one.
SUPFEMALE:Look at this, 20 calls.
LEADMALE: "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the" Oh, what am I doin'? Listen to me.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, I could just strangle you.
LEADFEMALE:So you're still miffed? Well, I don't mind bein' labeled a lesbian, honey, but since I'm not, you just ruined my social life.
LEADMALE:Oh, go ahead.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I'm a bubblehead and I deserve to die.
OTHERMALE:I said I'm a bubblehead and I deserve to die.
LEADFEMALE:And it was worth repeating.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, I just got off the phone with my girlfriend Gladys.
LEADMALE:She thinks you can do better than Blanche.
OTHERMALE:I agree, but, Ma, if it's all right with you, I have a lot of work to do here.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you're still working on that article.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you were just gonna help organize it.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you're doing this again.
LEADFEMALE:You're letting him take advantage of you like he did in high school.
LEADMALE:He is under a lot of pressure, and I don't want him to kiss his deadline.
LEADMALE:Miss.
SUPFEMALE:Miss his deadline.
OTHERMALE:Ooh, Mr.
LEADMALE:Gordon.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, all right.
SUPFEMALE:I admit it.
LEADFEMALE:I do have a little crush, but his kiss just took me by surprise.
LEADMALE:You know, at first, I didn't think he was going to do it.
LEADFEMALE:He looked more like he was going to wink, but then he slanted his head just slightly to the left.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know that slant.
LEADMALE:You know every slant.
LEADMALE:So why don't you let my daughter finish her one kissing story of the year? Thank you, Ma.
LEADMALE:My pleasure, meal ticket.
LEADFEMALE:It was at that point that I realized his head was coming toward me.
LEADFEMALE:Were his eyes open or closed? Open.
LEADMALE: And then he landed.
LEADMALE:I thought, "Oh, Mr.
SUPMALE:Gordon! "Oh, if only Cynthia Costello was here to see this.
SUPFEMALE:"  Kinky.
LEADMALE:I don't wanna hear any more of this.
LEADMALE:I don't like you being taken advantage of by some guy from out of town.
LEADFEMALE:At least, when Blanche does it, it's good for tourism.
LEADFEMALE:Then you're really not mad at me anymore? Rose, I'm a reasonable person.
LEADFEMALE:I forgive you.
LEADMALE:Does that mean you'll turn my heat back on? I was really chilly last night.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, what made you decide to forgive Rose? Because I'm reasonable and kind and considerate, and I'm back in the game.
LEADFEMALE:I have a date tonight with a young man I met in the produce department at the market.
OTHERMALE:I showed him how to thump a melon.
LEADMALE:There's a euphemism we haven't heard before.
LEADFEMALE:I realized something.
LEADFEMALE:Just because every man in my life thinks I'm a lesbian doesn't mean there aren't thousands and hundreds and millions of men out there who don't.
OTHERMALE: That must be my melon man.
OTHERMALE:Zorro rides again.
LEADFEMALE:Chuck! Thumper! Not exactly a Disney movie, is it? Oh, Chuck, this is my roommate Rose, and this is my roommate Dorothy and her mama, Sophia.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yes, I recognize them from TV.
LEADMALE:You You saw the show? Yes, I did.
SUPMALE:Blanche, it was one of the things that attracted me to you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, you don't understand.
LEADMALE:No, I do understand, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I understand that you're this way because you've probably never been with a real man.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, do I wet myself or laugh? All you need is to be loved by someone who knows how.
SUPMALE:Someone who will take his time and then show you passion beyond your wildest dreams.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, it's over between us.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche! Dorothy, now don't try to stop me.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you see I have to try this? Oh, all right, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I I understand.
LEADMALE:You're a good sport.
OTHERMALE:You just take care of her.
LEADFEMALE: Malcolm.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, I hope you don't mind me dropping by, but, well, I got an advance copy of the book review, and I thought you'd like to see our article in print.
LEADFEMALE:Are you kidding? Oh, let me read it.
LEADFEMALE:"'Nineteenth Century Writers Living in the Twentieth Century' "by Malcolm Gordon.
LEADMALE:" I see you used my title.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes.
SUPMALE:Read on, read on.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, is something wrong? Well, this is exactly the same article that I gave you.
SUPMALE:Well, it didn't need a lot of work.
SUPMALE:I--I didn't have to add much.
LEADMALE:I notice you didn't add my name to it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, no, no, not this time, but--but next time.
OTHERMALE:What makes you think there'll be a next time? Well, Dorothy, I did rewrite your article, but, well, they asked for a lot of changes in just a few short hours.
LEADFEMALE:So, I I submitted your pages and Well, I was just too embarrassed to tell them that it was your work, but it won't happen again, I promise.
OTHERMALE:No, it won't.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Gordon.
OTHERMALE: Malcolm.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:So am I.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong, Dorothy? Ma, you were right again.
LEADFEMALE:He was just using me.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down, pussycat.
OTHERFEMALE:I wanna tell you something.
SUPMALE:You give too much, and when you do that, you're gonna get hurt.
LEADMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, but I was so disappointed.
SUPMALE:For 40 years, I've had this fantasy that Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Gordon would come swooping into my life like Sir Lancelot.
LEADMALE:Now I don't even have that.
SUPFEMALE:You can keep the fantasy alive.
SUPFEMALE:It's part of life.
LEADMALE:You know what I call my pillow? Sal.
SUPMALE:Sometimes I hug it.
SUPFEMALE:Sometimes it lays there like a big lump, just like your father.
LEADMALE:That's how I keep him alive.
SUPFEMALE:That's lovely, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:You know what I call my other pillow? Dino.
LEADMALE:But that's another story.
SUPMALE:I'll tell you about it when you're, oh, about 70.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be here.
OTHERMALE:So will I, pussycat.
OTHERFEMALE:So will I.
LEADFEMALE: Yes? Hi, I--I don't know if you remember me.
SUPMALE:My name is Pat.
SUPFEMALE:I was on Wake-Up! Miami with you last week.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes, yes, of course.
OTHERFEMALE:What can I do for you? I heard about you and Blanche.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:It's too soon.
OTHERFEMALE:Too soon.
OTHERMALE:
