OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, honey.
SUPMALE:Girls, you will never guess who I just got off the phone with.
SUPFEMALE:Trudy McMann, your best friend from high school.
LEADFEMALE:She's coming to Miami for your high-school reunion.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, that's incredible.
LEADFEMALE:You must have ESP.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:I have a phone extension in my bedroom.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, how many times do I have to tell you not to listen in on my conversations? About twice a year.
LEADFEMALE:Like your phone is ringing off the hook.
SUPMALE:Like you got such a full social calendar.
LEADMALE:You're the only person who ever got a refund on call waiting.
LEADMALE:All right, Ma, all right.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, high-school reunions can be so much fun.
SUPFEMALE:I will never forget mine.
LEADMALE:I was the most successful person there.
SUPMALE:Blanche, didn't you go to school with that brilliant doctor who won the Nobel Prize? Oh, yes, but she let her looks go to hell.
LEADFEMALE:You do sound excited, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Well, I am, I am.
OTHERFEMALE:But mostly it's about seeing Trudy again.
SUPFEMALE:A girl never had a better friend than Trudy McMann.
SUPMALE: What, Ma? Oh, nothing.
LEADFEMALE:My underwear just hiked up on me.
LEADFEMALE:Right while you were lying.
LEADMALE:Why do you say I'm lying? "A girl never had a better friend than Trudy McMann"? Somebody here doesn't remember prom night, 1946.
OTHERFEMALE:Why? What happened? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I'm that somebody.
OTHERMALE:No, I think what Ma is referring to  is a little practical joke that Trudy played on me.
OTHERMALE:All of us on the tennis team decided that we would wear our tennis whites to the prom.
SUPMALE:Well, I showed up, and I was the only one.
LEADMALE:Oh, no! Your date must have been horrified.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:Her brother was a really good sport about it.
LEADMALE:No, Trudy and I played a lot of practical jokes on each other.
SUPMALE:It was all part of a happy, healthy rivalry.
LEADMALE:Oh, I was the butt of all kinds of jokes growing up.
LEADMALE:Actually, it ran in the family.
LEADMALE:In our breakfast room, we had one whole wall covered with "kick me" signs we had collected.
OTHERMALE:Oh, there was a story attached to each one of them.
SUPFEMALE:And in some cases, the original Scotch tape.
LEADMALE:So when's Trudy coming? Uh week after next.
LEADMALE:Which reminds me, I have to rush.
SUPMALE: Where to? Tennis lessons.
LEADFEMALE:I figure, if she's gonna be here, we ought to have a nice, quiet game.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's sweet.
LEADFEMALE:And a lot of crap.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna mop the court with her.
LEADMALE:Oh, my.
SUPMALE:Looks like our Dorothy still holds a grudge.
LEADMALE:'Course she holds a grudge.
LEADMALE:We Sicilians are good at that.
SUPFEMALE:That, and holding a grudge.
LEADMALE:Sophia, you said "holding a grudge" twice.
SUPMALE:Hey, if you're good at something, you brag about it.
SUPMALE:I am so excited.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe I'm going to see Trudy again after all these years.
OTHERMALE:I'm excited for you, too, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:That's why I want everything perfect.
LEADMALE:I'm making Scandinavia's oldest and most traditional appetizer treat
LEADFEMALE:cheese and crackers.
SUPFEMALE:Cheese and crackers, Rose? Not eggs gafloofen? Ham and gunterhoggins? Pigs in a svenkabluden? No, but you sure know how to make a girl's mouth water.
LEADMALE: Oh, my God.
SUPFEMALE:That's her.
OTHERFEMALE:I sure hope time has been good to Trudy.
OTHERFEMALE:Good, not great.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Trudy.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Oh  It's been so long.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you look It's been so long.
LEADFEMALE:I know, and you
LEADFEMALE:you look exactly the way you did at our high-school graduation.
LEADMALE:'Course, rumors were that you were three months' pregnant.
SUPMALE:I want you to meet my husband Jack.
LEADMALE:You didn't tell me you had such a handsome husband.
LEADMALE:Didn't tell you he was rich, either.
LEADMALE:That's my Trudy.
LEADFEMALE:You haven't lost your sense of humor.
LEADMALE:Or those pesky ten pounds.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Petrillo, is that you? No, it's Jane Fonda.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Give us a hug.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, Trudy, it's so good to see you again.
LEADMALE:Honey, meet my roommates
LEADFEMALE:Rose and Blanche.
LEADMALE:It's a pleasure.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy's told us so much about you.
OTHERFEMALE:All good, I hope.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, actually Sit! Well, finally I get to meet the infamous Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, has Trudy told me stories about you two.
LEADMALE:I'll bet she has.
LEADFEMALE:We had such a great time back in high school.
OTHERMALE:Like the time you and Trudy ran against each other for class treasurer? You know, back in St.
SUPMALE:Olaf, I ran for president of the Bull Castration Club.
LEADFEMALE:There is no sound in this world sweeter than a bull's moo as it climbs an octave.
SUPFEMALE:Did you win? No.
LEADFEMALE:Lost by a hair.
LEADFEMALE:I admired you after that loss, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:You just picked up the pieces and went on.
SUPMALE:Just like you did after Stanley ran off with that stewardess.
LEADMALE:Boy, I envy you your gumption.
SUPFEMALE:And I your breast implants.
LEADFEMALE:This may not be my place, but you two hardly sound like old friends.
LEADMALE:Blanche is right.
LEADMALE:We should be more positive.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, you look wonderful.
LEADMALE:Ah.
SUPFEMALE:The left one turned out nice.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy! Oh, come on, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just kidding.
OTHERFEMALE:They're both practically the same size.
SUPMALE:How about giving me a hand in the kitchen? Were they like that in high school, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Petrillo? Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Her breasts were actually a lot smaller back then.
LEADFEMALE:I meant, were they rivals? What is this
LEADFEMALE:Nova? I don't have all the answers.
SUPFEMALE:I'm afraid you'll have to excuse Sophia, Jack.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:You heard that? I thought I was safe backed up against these pillows.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we see what's keeping Trudy and Dorothy? Probably got caught up reminiscing.
LEADMALE:You know how it is when old pals get together.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse us.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's that.
LEADFEMALE:How does it feel to have your butt whipped? Well, sometimes I find it strangely titillating, but Oh! You were talking to her.
LEADFEMALE:Trudy, how about if tomorrow we play a real game? Something that requires real skill.
LEADFEMALE:You mean like midget ice bowling? I'm talking about tennis, you doofus.
SUPMALE:Aren't you afraid of being humiliated on the tennis court? Me humiliated? I think you forget, Trudy, we have to wear tennis dresses.
SUPFEMALE:You're on, you pathetic middle-aged cow.
LEADFEMALE:I am looking forward to it, you miserable sack of cellulite.
LEADMALE:Did I tell you that Larry Prowse called the other day? Really? Did he ever get married? Three times.
SUPMALE:Actually four, if you count Victor.
LEADFEMALE:Can you believe it? Two women competing like that, and there's not even a man at stake.
LEADMALE:In Sicily, women compete for everything.
LEADFEMALE:The most famous example is the Great String-Cheese War of '47.
OTHERMALE:But why should I bore you with that? You all have college credits.
LEADFEMALE:You took history.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, have you been out in the hot sun too long? It's a possibility.
SUPMALE:Is there wax running out of my ears? Boy, Trudy is beating the dickens out of Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh I just have to catch my breath.
LEADMALE:Are we gonna play, or do you wanna forfeit? No way.
LEADMALE:No, Dorothy Zbornak doesn't know the meaning of the word "forfeit.
LEADFEMALE:" And she's a teacher, too.
SUPFEMALE:No wonder the Japanese are ahead of us.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna kill you, Trudy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, do you really think she can make a comeback? I'm sure she can.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy's running Trudy all over the court.
LEADMALE:Oh, Trudy tripped.
SUPFEMALE:And she's not getting up.
SUPMALE:You think something's wrong? I think she's fainted.
LEADMALE:I hope it's not anything worse.
LEADMALE:It is.
SUPMALE:I've seen that look before.
LEADMALE:You don't think? There are two things in this world a Sicilian knows.
LEADMALE:When pasta sticks to a wall, it's done.
LEADFEMALE:When a body sticks to cement, it's dead.
SUPMALE:Why did it have to happen this way? I feel like a murderer! I will not hear any more of that nonsense.
LEADFEMALE:It was a freak occurrence on a tennis court.
LEADMALE:She's right, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:You did nothing wrong.
LEADMALE:Technically.
OTHERMALE:I mean, nothing that would hold up in a court of law.
SUPFEMALE:But why Trudy? She was the most energetic, alive person I ever knew.
OTHERMALE:At the Center, Dorothy, we teach acceptance.
LEADFEMALE:In life, some things are inevitable, and you just have to accept them.
SUPFEMALE:She is right, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I know because I've been there myself.
OTHERFEMALE:You killed your best friend, too, Blanche? Sorry, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:I remember I was a blossoming belle who had just won the Little Miss Magnolia Pageant.
SUPMALE:Blanche, before you start, realize I am very vulnerable now and in no mood to hear a story about you and some yahoo cracker with four first names pawing at each other under a magnolia tree.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, pardon me, Dorothy, but we can't all come from places as socially acceptable as Brooklyn.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Go on with the story.
LEADFEMALE:Just try to shy away from words like "tarnation" and "catfish.
LEADFEMALE:" Fine.
LEADMALE:Anyway, I was about eight years old when I first met Cathy Lee on the playground.
LEADMALE:We became fast friends, just as thick as Louisiana blackstrap molasses on a stake of johnnycakes as high as an elephant's knee On a riverboat floating down the Mississippi delta.
LEADMALE:Finish the damn story, Blanche! Anyway, it was at our Southern seafood fry that I proudly dragged Cathy Lee over to meet my folks.
LEADMALE:My mama took one look at Cathy Lee and forbad me ever to see her again.
LEADMALE:Why? Because her mother was not in the Daughters of the Confederacy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! How my heart went out to little Cathy Lee, standing there while our servants snickered at her servants.
OTHERMALE:But Mama insisted I break off the friendship, or I wouldn't get brand-new riding boots for Christmas.
SUPFEMALE:So I did.
LEADMALE:Blanche, why is this a story about acceptance? Because years later, to get back at me, Cathy Lee slept with my daddy.
LEADMALE:That was something I had to accept.
LEADFEMALE:Mama accepted it, too.
SUPMALE:Along with a brand-new Cadillac Eldorado for her birthday.
SUPFEMALE:You know, my family had a few dollars, and I loved them dearly, but when you get right down to it, basically, they were trash.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:The reunion'll get your mind off of it.
SUPMALE:People should be coming in a couple of hours.
LEADFEMALE:The party.
LEADFEMALE:The party! I totally forgot! There is no way I can face those people.
LEADMALE:Honey, of course you can.
LEADFEMALE:You were all friends of Trudy's.
LEADFEMALE:You can console each other.
LEADFEMALE:It'll help you to cope.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe this is just what I need.
LEADMALE:Aw, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Good for you, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE: Of course, breaking the news will not be easy.
LEADMALE:Want my advice? Wait a couple of hours before you do.
SUPMALE:Stuff like this can put a real damper on happy hour.
LEADFEMALE:And listen, Rose, remember, mum's the word.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy will break the bad news in due time.
LEADFEMALE:OK? Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Has anyone seen Dorothy? She said hello and then disappeared.
LEADFEMALE:Is there a problem? No! No problem at all.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's fine.
LEADMALE:It's not like anyone died or anything.
SUPMALE: It's so good to see everyone.
SUPFEMALE:But where's Trudy? She hasn't seen me in years.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't wait to see the look on her face.
LEADFEMALE:You could wait six months, it wouldn't change.
LEADFEMALE:It's been almost two hours.
LEADFEMALE:We can't keep up this charade.
LEADMALE:Somebody has got to get Dorothy to come out and break the news.
SUPFEMALE:But she's so fragile now.
LEADMALE:We have to be tender and compassionate, kindly and sympathetic and caring and understanding Stop babbling, you yutz.
OTHERMALE:I'll do it, I'll do it.
SUPFEMALE:Picture it
LEADMALE:Sicily, 1852.
SUPMALE:Ma, I am in no mood.
SUPFEMALE:And besides, you weren't alive in 1852.
SUPMALE:What? We can't learn from history? It was mid-century and a disillusioned Italy looked to the house of Savoy for leadership.
SUPFEMALE:Giuseppe Garibaldi, our courageous leader, and not a bad dresser, thought, "Let's regain some national pride and jump into this Crimean War thing.
LEADFEMALE:" Of course, there was a big kickoff party at Giuseppe's beach house, and everyone came.
OTHERFEMALE:Coincidentally, this was also the night his wife Rosa hit her sexual peak.
LEADMALE:Ma, I am in here because of guilt.
LEADMALE:This is not a story about guilt.
SUPMALE:This is a story about being a bad hostess.
SUPMALE:While Rosa had Giuseppe in the bedroom with his saber around his ankles, were strip-searching mice for a piece of cheese.
LEADMALE:Ma, so what's your point? That Rosa and I throw bad parties? That's my minor point.
LEADMALE:My major point is that, like Rosa, you're screwing around in the bedroom when there are important things to do outside.
SUPMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:That makes sense.
LEADMALE:I mean, you went the long way around but that actually makes sense.
LEADMALE:Look, pussycat, your friends deserve to know about Trudy.
OTHERFEMALE:And they'll understand, because they are your friends.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma.
LEADMALE:Ma, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Well here goes.
SUPMALE:Everybody Everybody, can I have your attention, please? Uh I know I've been a bit scarce tonight, but there is a reason.
LEADFEMALE:Something tragic happened this morning.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Ma, I need your help.
SUPFEMALE:Sure, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Trudy's dead.
OTHERMALE:Please, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:It happened this morning when we were playing tennis.
LEADMALE:Trudy's heart just couldn't take it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so sorry that I dragged her out on the court and made her run back and forth so hard.
LEADMALE:I wish it had been me instead of her, because it's all my fault.
OTHERMALE:We might as well take down that banner and put up one that says, "Welcome to the Dorothy Killed Trudy Party"!  Oh, darn.
SUPFEMALE:Someone's late.
LEADMALE:Dorothy'll have to give her speech all over again.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, everybody!  Trudy? I don't believe this.
SUPFEMALE:Is that you? In the flesh.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, but I can't believe you're really here! I don't understand! How did you? It was all staged, Rose.
SUPMALE:A patented Trudy McMann practical joke.
LEADMALE: Well, I don't find that one bit funny.
LEADMALE:It was cruel, Trudy.
LEADMALE:Come on! It was just a practical joke like we did in high school.
LEADMALE:Some of the things we did in high school are not necessarily appropriate when we're adults.
LEADFEMALE:Like staying up all night and carousing around, dating every other man you meet.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm losing credibility here, aren't I? Trudy, you did a very cruel thing.
OTHERFEMALE: OK.
LEADMALE:OK.
LEADMALE:If I went too far, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Maybe you ought to apologize to Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:She's back in her bedroom.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Dorothy? Are you all right? Go away.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, honey, it's Rose.
LEADMALE:We need to talk.
LEADFEMALE:I said go away.
LEADMALE:Leave it to me.
SUPFEMALE:In a few minutes, I'll have her beaming from ear to ear.
LEADMALE:  Oh, my God! Trudy! Dorothy! Jack! How come you're alive? How come you're in bed with my husband? I asked you first.
LEADMALE:Honey, it's not what it looks like.
LEADMALE:Obviously.
LEADMALE:Dorothy thought I was dead, tried to comfort you, and the two of you got carried away.
LEADFEMALE:OK, it is what it looks like.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe this.
SUPFEMALE:I was just playing a prank.
LEADMALE:Do you have any idea how I feel? What kind of person jumps into bed with her dearest friend's husband? Not necessarily a bad person.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes circumstances Oh.
SUPFEMALE:You were talking about her.
SUPMALE:I think I'm gonna faint.
LEADMALE:Gotcha! Dorothy, what the hell is going on here? Revenge! It suddenly occurred to me
OTHERMALE:what if this was the ultimate practical joke? So I dragged it out of Jack, and the two of us cooked up this topper.
LEADFEMALE:Jack, I can't believe you went along with this.
LEADFEMALE:So I got in bed with Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:It was a joke! Don't even think it, Ma.
LEADMALE:If you knew before, why didn't you tell me? Ma, you have a big mouth.
SUPMALE:Me? If I had a big mouth, do you think your one-night stand with the bug man would still be a secret? Oops.
LEADMALE:Dorothy Zbornak, this is the most underhanded, sneaky practical joke anyone has ever made, and I have just one thing to say.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, have I missed you! Oh, Trudy Trudy! I've missed you, too.
LEADFEMALE:Wait just a minute.
SUPFEMALE:You two are not mad? Are you kidding? Our friendship was built on years of this.
LEADFEMALE:Trudy, you have made this one hell of a reunion.
SUPMALE:Speaking of which, there's a party out there.
SUPFEMALE:Come on! Well, Dorothy Zbornak, I cannot believe you put Rose and me through this.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah! What are you talking about? You knew Trudy was playing a practical joke all along, and you never shared it with your best friends? We thought you were devastated.
LEADFEMALE:We suffered right along with you.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah! That was insensitive.
LEADMALE:Insensitive! Selfish.
LEADFEMALE:Selfish! As far as we are concerned, Dorothy Zbornak, you have gone too far this time.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:This is unforgivable.
LEADMALE:We are never gonna speak to you again.
SUPMALE:Right! Gotcha.
LEADMALE:Very, very convincing, Blanche.
SUPMALE:I can't take all the credit.
SUPMALE:I did have some help.
LEADFEMALE:Right, Rose? Rose? Rose? 
LEADFEMALE:
