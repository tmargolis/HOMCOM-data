LEADFEMALE:Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Oh, hi, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to this.
SUPMALE:"If I were truly free, O fire of my loins" "I'd take you to a paradise in the sun where we could lie naked, "bronzed body against pearl body, locked together in a frenzy of love.
SUPMALE:" Ma, who wrote that?! Merrill Kellogg.
LEADFEMALE:Merrill Who's he? Ask Blanche.
LEADMALE:It's her letter.
LEADFEMALE:This is from that guy in prison that Blanche has been writing to.
SUPMALE:How are you gonna explain this opened letter to Blanche? Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, girls.
LEADMALE:Good morning, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose opened your letter.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I didn't.
LEADFEMALE:It's no problem, honey.
SUPMALE:It's just another one of those letters from Merrill.
LEADMALE:I would read it to you anyway
SUPFEMALE:they're not personal.
LEADFEMALE:Not personal? The man said he wants to lie naked with you on a beach.
OTHERMALE:Sure.
OTHERMALE:And I wrote him I want to make passionate love to him in a hammock suspended between two magnolia trees
LEADMALE:you know that couldn't possibly happen.
OTHERMALE:Well, maybe if you lose a few pounds Shut up, Rose.
LEADMALE:These letters are just a fantasy.
LEADMALE:The man is in prison for the next 20 years for armed robbery.
SUPMALE:Blanche, I don't think it's right to lead the guy on like that.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? The poor man is surrounded by concrete and bars.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with bringing a little joy into his life? Nothing at all.
LEADFEMALE:Back in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf, our justice system is very progressive.
LEADFEMALE:Their motto was, "Use a gun, go apologize.
OTHERFEMALE:"   I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Mary, honey! Hi, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, welcome, stranger.
LEADMALE:Come in here and sit down.
OTHERFEMALE:So how've you been doing? Tell me, sweetheart, you having fun in high school? It's OK.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I loved high school.
SUPMALE:It seems like only yesterday
SUPFEMALE:riding around with the boys in their cars, and the dances Don't forget the Hindenburg disaster.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, look who's here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! So, Mary, when's the baby due? Ma, you're talking to a 16-year-old girl.
SUPMALE:A knocked-up Ma, how did you know? Because you had the same look of panic on your face when you got pregnant.
OTHERFEMALE:Kind of like a deer caught in the headlights of a car.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought only pregnant teenagers had that expression, until I saw Dan Quayle on TV.
SUPMALE:I can't believe it.
OTHERFEMALE:It was only yesterday you were selling us cookies.
LEADMALE:Now she's giving them away.
SUPMALE:Mary, honey, have you told your father? I tried, but since Mom died, I don't know, we're just on different wavelengths.
LEADMALE:Well, honey, what about the baby's father? After all, it's his responsibility, too.
LEADMALE:We broke up.
SUPMALE:And besides, he's away at college now.
OTHERMALE:What are you gonna do? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:My father kicked me out.
LEADMALE:I got so many things I gotta figure out.
LEADMALE:I guess I gotta get a job and a place to stay.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mary, look, you have too many things to figure out.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you stay here with us, until we can all decide what to do? Absolutely.
LEADMALE:Really? Yes, we'll take care of you.
LEADMALE:I don't know how to thank you.
SUPMALE:Now, you come into the kitchen with me, honey.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get you some pickles and ice cream.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, thanks.
LEADMALE:I don't have any strange cravings yet.
LEADFEMALE:Strange? I cannot believe her father could be so mean.
SUPMALE:Not half as mean as his dog Samson.
SUPMALE:Did I ever tell you what that dog did to my friend Ida Silverman? No.
LEADMALE:What? He ate her.
LEADMALE:Gobbled her up without a trace, support hose and all.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, Ida's daughter told me she moved to Fort Lauderdale.
OTHERMALE:The woman's in denial.
OTHERMALE:I saw that dog with Ida's blue scarf in his mouth, and no one has seen her since.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, what does Fred's dog have to do with this? It's a known fact that dogs take on the personality traits of their masters.
OTHERMALE:That's ridiculous.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? Then why does your brother Phil's poodle like to wear that tutu and hop around on his hind legs? Oh, come on, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, Phil would look pretty stupid doing that by himself.
SUPMALE:Rose.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose! Blanche, what's wrong? I never finished reading this letter from Merrill till just now.
LEADMALE:Read that last paragraph.
LEADMALE:"My sentence has been overturned on a technicality.
SUPFEMALE:"I'm getting out on the 21st.
SUPMALE:Now, finally, we can make all our dreams come true.
LEADFEMALE:" Isn't that terrible? He's written catchier stuff, but I wouldn't call it terrible.
LEADMALE:I'm not asking for a literary critique, you dweeb! Merrill gets out on the But isn't that great news? You can finally meet him.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to meet him! I don't want him coming here
OTHERMALE:the man's a convict.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so Blanche's pen pal is getting out.
SUPMALE:Gee, that's gonna be rough.
LEADMALE:I bet after ten years in the jug, he's gonna be pretty short on foreplay.
SUPFEMALE: Come in.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:I brought you an extra blanket.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Seems like old times, huh? I love this house.
SUPFEMALE:I love this room.
SUPFEMALE:I just feel so safe here.
LEADFEMALE:After I'd visit Mom in the hospital, I always was so glad to come back here.
OTHERMALE:Now here I am again.
LEADFEMALE:Only, this time I'm pregnant.
LEADMALE:It's funny, huh? What's that, honey? It's just that I have another human being inside of me, and I've never felt more alone.
OTHERMALE:Mary, that's why you have to talk to your father.
LEADFEMALE:No way.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, this is the most difficult thing for a father to accept.
LEADMALE:What, that I'm a grown woman? But you're not a grown woman.
LEADMALE:Just because the plumbing's in doesn't mean the house is ready to occupy.
LEADFEMALE:I think I know what you're getting at.
LEADFEMALE:Good, because I really didn't make that up myself.
OTHERMALE:I heard it on This Old House.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I tried talking to my father, but he just went all crazy when I told him.
LEADFEMALE:That's what fathers do
LEADMALE:they yell and they barbecue.
SUPMALE:That's what separates them from the apes.
LEADMALE:What did your father do when he found out you were pregnant? He chased Stan for three blocks with a salami.
LEADFEMALE:How come? They don't leave marks.
SUPMALE:When he finally cooled down, he realized that he loved me more than anything in the world
SUPMALE:which was lucky for me, because I never needed him more than I did then.
OTHERMALE:I don't think that's gonna happen with my dad.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you never know.
OTHERFEMALE:Fathers can surprise you sometimes.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy? You remember when Mom was sick, you used to stay with me until I fell asleep? And I used to hold your hand Ma, what are you doing? Merrill called.
SUPFEMALE:He's coming over.
LEADMALE:I'm hiding all our valuables.
LEADMALE:Why? Why? You think the man went to prison for free coveralls and some male bonding?  Quick, give me a hand with the TV.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma! I cannot believe that Merrill is a dangerous criminal.
OTHERMALE:I mean, you've read his letters.
SUPFEMALE:They're beautiful.
OTHERFEMALE:They're poetic, almost lyrical.
SUPFEMALE:You can be sure he's a real gentleman.
SUPMALE:I want Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Break out the finger sandwiches.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Astaire looks like he's hungry.
LEADMALE:I'm Merrill.
SUPFEMALE:Are you Blanche? No.
LEADMALE:How about you, cutie? Boy, this guy's done hard time! No, Blanche isn't here, and she won't be back for a long, long time.
OTHERFEMALE:That's all right.
SUPFEMALE:I've been in prison ten years.
LEADMALE:I'm real good at waiting.
LEADFEMALE:Uh Can I get you something, Merrill? No.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, those were lovely letters that you wrote to Blanche, Merrill.
OTHERMALE:No, I didn't write 'em.
SUPFEMALE:Walter, the guy in the next cell, did.
LEADMALE:Wrote 'em to Harley, the night guard.
SUPMALE:He's hoping to round himself up a date for movie night.
LEADFEMALE:I just copied the letters and changed "Dearest Harley" to "Dearest Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:" Well, you did make a small contribution, Merrill.
LEADFEMALE:Call me Moose
LEADMALE:that's my nickname.
LEADFEMALE:What a coincidence! That was Dorothy's nickname in elementary school.
OTHERFEMALE:Remember, Dorothy? No, I don't.
SUPMALE:Look, Moose  What? We don't know where Blanche is.
OTHERMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:She could be gone for hours.
LEADMALE:Days.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it could be weeks before she gets back.
LEADMALE:We're back! Oh, we found some terrific bargains.
SUPMALE:Mary, why don't you go try something on and show Dorothy and Sophia.
LEADMALE:Well! Dorothy, you didn't tell me you were expecting company.
SUPMALE:This is Merrill.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Well, how are you, Merrill? Merrill! Actually, he's more a friend of Blanche's.
LEADFEMALE:We were just explaining to Merrill that there's no telling when Blanche will be back.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Lord, no.
LEADMALE:There's no use waiting around.
SUPMALE:You wouldn't like Blanche anyway.
LEADFEMALE:She's not your type.
SUPMALE:That's right.
SUPFEMALE:She isn't.
LEADFEMALE:She's very cold.
SUPMALE:Frigid.
SUPMALE:Hardly likes men at all.
LEADFEMALE:And she's ugly.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't she? "Ugly" is a pretty strong word, Rose.
SUPMALE:And wrinkled.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't she? She is not wrinkled.
SUPFEMALE:And fat.
SUPMALE:Stop that! You just stop that right now.
SUPFEMALE:She is none of those things, Rose Nylund.
LEADMALE:She is gorgeous.
LEADFEMALE:Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous! All right, all right.
LEADMALE:Sounds good.
LEADFEMALE:Tell Blanche I'll be back.
LEADMALE:And stupid.
OTHERFEMALE:Stupid, stupid, stupid! Well, I'm off.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be checking in for messages.
LEADFEMALE:Take care of the house for me.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you gonna go? I'll be staying with my friend Janet.
SUPMALE:She said I could spend the night there anytime.
LEADFEMALE:Or was it her husband Ed who said that? I just had a thought.
SUPFEMALE:Congratulations.
SUPMALE:Way to go.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe we should sign Mary up for some natural childbirth classes.
LEADFEMALE:That's not a bad idea.
LEADFEMALE:I wish I'd known about them when I was pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know what to do, except scream at Stan never to touch me again and call him every name in the book.
LEADFEMALE:Rough labor? Rough conception.
OTHERMALE:Oh, she doesn't need those classes.
OTHERMALE:I think women ought to have babies the way God intended
LEADMALE:strapped to a table, numb from the neck down.
LEADFEMALE:Let me ask a question.
SUPMALE:So, how much responsibility are we taking on ourselves here? Oh, Ma, what are you talking about? We can't just abandon her.
SUPMALE:The girl needs a roof over her head, guidance, emotional support.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not up to us.
SUPMALE:It's up to her father.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I tried talking to him.
LEADFEMALE:He won't answer his phone calls or the messages that I leave in his mailbox.
LEADMALE:First he lets his dog eat Ida, now this.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm mad as hell! Let's go over there.
OTHERMALE:No, Ma, Ma, I don't think you should go.
SUPMALE:This is a very sensitive situation, and it's gonna take a little patience and understanding.
LEADMALE:That's perfect.
SUPMALE:All I have is a little patience and understanding.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right.
OTHERMALE:But when we get there, remember we are trying to make peace.
SUPFEMALE:So whatever you do, don't bring up Ida.
SUPFEMALE:I won't
LEADFEMALE:as long as the dog doesn't.
LEADMALE:Hello, Fred.
OTHERMALE:Hello, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Petrillo.
LEADMALE:Why haven't you returned my calls? There's nothing to talk about.
LEADMALE:We're not going away, Fred.
SUPFEMALE:All right, come in.
LEADMALE:Have a seat.
LEADMALE:Uh excuse me.
OTHERMALE:Has he eaten? Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:He won't hurt you.
SUPMALE:Fred, I think I know how you feel about Mary.
LEADMALE:No, you don't.
SUPFEMALE:You feel, because Mary went out and got herself pregnant, she's a slut.
LEADMALE:Well, let me tell you what a slut is.
LEADFEMALE:It's someone who gets knocked up in the back seat of a Studebaker at a drive-in movie.
OTHERMALE:It was a Studebaker, wasn't it, Dorothy? It was a Nash, Ma.
OTHERMALE:Now, that's a slut.
SUPFEMALE:Doggy, I don't know if you noticed, I'm all skin and bones.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I shouldn't say "bones.
LEADFEMALE:" Now where was I? You were humiliating me.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, right, the slut.
SUPMALE:And after all she did to me, did I turn her out? You tried, Ma.
SUPMALE:But did she go? No.
SUPMALE:And look at us today.
LEADFEMALE:No one could love a daughter more.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, Ma.
LEADMALE:So what if I don't respect her.
LEADMALE:You've got a lot of nerve coming in here telling me how to raise my daughter.
LEADFEMALE:You have no idea what I'm going through.
LEADMALE: I gotta get outta here.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about the dog.
SUPFEMALE:He's just playing.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:What did you do with Ida?  Samson.
SUPFEMALE:Fred, what Ma was trying to say is that you can't just throw Mary out.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't throw her out.
LEADFEMALE:She walked out.
OTHERMALE:That's not how Mary tells it.
SUPMALE:We got into a fight.
SUPMALE:Who remembers who said what? That's not the point.
SUPMALE:Fred, I remember how scared I felt when I found out I was pregnant.
SUPMALE:And you know what my biggest fear was? That my father would hate me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, God, was he angry
SUPFEMALE:and was I scared.
LEADMALE:It was a long time before he'd accept the situation, and, Fred, until he did, I only had one parent.
LEADMALE:Right now, Mary doesn't have any parents.
SUPFEMALE:You talk like I did something wrong.
OTHERMALE:What can I say that'll make you understand? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Maybe I'm too stupid.
SUPMALE:Fine, then maybe there is something I can say.
LEADFEMALE:And I want to apologize for this story before I begin.
LEADMALE:Have you ever heard of a little town called St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf? No.
SUPFEMALE:Perfect.
SUPFEMALE:Now, as it was told to me
LEADFEMALE:and I have to admit that I wasn't listening that closely
LEADMALE:there was this farmer named Nils Nibelung, and he had a pig named Brunhilde, and she won all the blue ribbons at all the county fairs.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Nils also had a daughter named Fricka, and she won red ribbons
SUPFEMALE:usually as runner-up to the pig.
OTHERFEMALE:Does this story have a point? You asked that at just the right time.
LEADMALE:Anyway, one April, Nils decided to breed Brunhilde
OTHERFEMALE:that's the pig, not the daughter
OTHERFEMALE:and he chose April because that's when pigs are at their most beautiful and desirable.
OTHERFEMALE:Unfortunately, so was Fricka.
OTHERMALE:So while Brunhilde and the pig were doing their thing, Fricka and the local pig breeder were doing theirs.
SUPMALE:God, I hope I got the names right.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, when Nils heard about it, he banished Fricka from his house and his life forever.
SUPFEMALE:So? So after a while he lost interest in the pig's company and he ate her.
LEADFEMALE:And he died St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf's loneliest man.
LEADFEMALE:Is that the end of the story? God, I hope so.
LEADFEMALE:I don't get it.
LEADFEMALE:Fred, let me put it this way.
LEADFEMALE:She is 16, she's scared, and she's carrying your grandchild.
OTHERMALE:Do you really want to abandon her? Anybody home? Oh, I thought you were gonna spend the night at Janet's.
LEADMALE:On the way over there, I got to thinking, is there really any reason for me to be running away from Merrill? I mean, the man has paid his debt to society, hasn't he? After all, is there any man on earth I can't handle? Well, I got nowhere with Fred.
SUPFEMALE:And Ma was no help
LEADFEMALE:there is no way to control her mouth.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God!  What happened? What's the matter? Who did this to you? The Sandinistas.
SUPFEMALE: Why would they do this? Because I knew too much.
LEADMALE:Merrill did this about an hour ago.
LEADMALE:Merrill? Ma, are you all right? What did Merrill do? He came looking for Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I held out as long as I could.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God! How did he make you talk? I think it was the white wine.
OTHERMALE:I finally told him she was Blanche and she didn't want anything to do with him.
LEADFEMALE:What did he say? He said he wanted to have something to remember you by.
LEADMALE:So he took the silver.
LEADMALE:Oh! At least it's some consolation that he couldn't possibly find the secret place where I hide my jewelry.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Did I mention there was wine and music?  I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? Merrill! My God! Where are you? Jail? Well, they only allow you one phone call, and you called me? What? I'm wearing a green silk pant suit.
LEADMALE:Underneath? Well Oh, give me that!  Fred! Hi, I thought I'd stop by since I was in the neighborhood.
OTHERMALE:Fred, you live in the neighborhood.
LEADFEMALE:Right, Well, I wanted to come by and see Mary.
SUPMALE:Hi, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:How're you doing? I'm doing OK.
OTHERMALE:Good.
OTHERMALE:Look, Mary, I've been talking to Dorothy, and she really made sense.
SUPFEMALE:It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you just come home and we'll work it out? Sounds good.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, guys, for everything.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you be a stranger now.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:I'll come back tomorrow and get the rest of my stuff.
SUPMALE:Let us know how you're doing.
LEADMALE:Don't forget, Tuesday we have mime class.
OTHERMALE:Mime class? The Lamaze class was all filled up.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we'll see you soon.
LEADFEMALE:And, Dorothy, thanks for all your help.
LEADMALE:Maybe we can get together soon and you can tell me all about that St.
LEADMALE:Olaf.
LEADMALE:Sounds like a good place to raise a daughter.
LEADFEMALE:I was desperate! 
SUPFEMALE:
