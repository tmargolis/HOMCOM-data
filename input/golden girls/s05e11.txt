SUPFEMALE:Blanche.
LEADMALE:Your picture's in the paper.
SUPFEMALE:And there's a big article about the Citrus Festival.
LEADMALE:What's it say, what's it say? "Miami will be busy this weekend with ten major conventions.
LEADMALE:" Listen to this.
LEADFEMALE:"The highlight being the Citrus Festival Ball, "which is being chaired this year by 35-year-old Blanche Devereaux.
LEADFEMALE:" How much did that cost you? I don't have to pay for my compliments.
SUPFEMALE:You went to bed with him? Twice.
LEADMALE:But it's not like I wouldn't have anyway.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, good.
OTHERFEMALE:The newspaper's here.
SUPMALE:Gimme the classifieds.
SUPMALE:Oh, Ma, Ma, you're not gonna answer ads in the personals again, are you? We got a lot of complaints last time.
LEADMALE:Hey, he asked for a single white female who likes to party, and he got one.
LEADMALE:No, I need to make some extra money.
LEADFEMALE:What for? When you get to be my age, the quality of your life changes.
OTHERMALE:While you're at work, I'm here by myself all day, and it gets lonely.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I could stay home more.
LEADFEMALE:Or we could get a giant-screen TV.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma, we can't afford that.
SUPMALE:That's the thing.
OTHERMALE:The classifieds are filled with ads from people who couldn't find a hotel this weekend, and want to rent a room anyplace they can.
OTHERMALE:I'm not opening my home to boarders.
LEADMALE:Oh, they usually just turn out to be lowlife trash who'll make a mess, and half the time you can't get your money from 'em.
LEADFEMALE:Which reminds me, Rose, your rent check is late.
LEADMALE: Hello? Yes, she is.
OTHERMALE:It's for you, Leona.
LEADFEMALE:Who is it? Your father.
LEADFEMALE:Big Daddy? Is that you, Big Daddy? Hello, darling, how are you? Oh, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Well, darling, I can't come see you this weekend.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, I mean it.
OTHERMALE:If it had been any other weekend I know, but I'm queen of a ball.
OTHERMALE:Ain't that something? Here, listen to this.
OTHERMALE:
LEADMALE:"The highlight being the Citrus Festival Ball, "which is being chaired this year by 35-year-old Blanche Devereaux.
OTHERMALE:" Twice.
SUPFEMALE:I probably would have anyway, though.
SUPMALE:Sorry I can't come see you this weekend, but I'll check in with you on Monday.
LEADMALE:I love you too.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:How is Big Daddy? I think he's just missing me.
SUPFEMALE:He's a little blue.
LEADMALE:But when this festival is over, I'll fly up and spend a few days with him.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Look at this, look! Here's a couple that's willing to pay $400 a night for a room.
SUPFEMALE:$400? Back in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf, the most expensive room was $18.
LEADMALE:50.
OTHERMALE:And that includes the cow.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, Rose.
LEADMALE:Why would you want a cow in the room? It's the law.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you so much.
LEADMALE:Oh, everybody get in here! Come and see what I just got.
LEADMALE:What is it, Blanche? My commemorative plate from the Citrus Festival just arrived.
SUPFEMALE:Can I see it? Oh, no, darling, don't touch it.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody must touch it.
LEADMALE:It is very rare.
SUPMALE:Only the five people on the committee get these each year.
LEADMALE:Oh, look.
OTHERFEMALE:Have you ever seen a more moving piece of art? Only at Graceland.
SUPMALE:See what it says?  Hello? Who's calling? Oh, hi.
SUPMALE:Hang on.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, it's your sister, Virginia.
SUPMALE:Oh, for goodness Virginia, honey, is that you? I swear the whole family's coming out of the woodwork.
LEADMALE:Guess what? I'm queen of a ball.
LEADFEMALE:Twice.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but I probably would have anyway.
LEADMALE:What? I spoke to Big Daddy just yesterday.
LEADMALE:I see.
SUPFEMALE:All right, I'll be there as soon as I can.
LEADMALE:Blanche, what is it? Oh, it's Big Daddy.
SUPMALE:He's dead.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you're as friendly as your skies are, I'd sure love to get together sometime.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:I have a flight to Atlanta first thing tomorrow morning.
LEADMALE:Blanche, honey, are you sure that you don't want one of us to go with you? Don't be silly, I'm fine.
LEADMALE:I'll just fly up to Atlanta tomorrow morning, tell Big Daddy I love him, and be back here in time to be queen of the ball.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, you can't do that.
LEADMALE:Why not? Big Daddy isn't dead.
LEADFEMALE:I think Virginia's playing a little practical joke.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of a person plays a joke like that? You want to play a joke, you ring somebody's doorbell and run away.
LEADMALE:Or you shorten the leg on somebody's walker so it wobbles.
LEADMALE:Or you arrange for somebody to go on a long car trip with Rose.
LEADMALE:You don't tell them their father's dead.
SUPMALE:Now, look.
LEADMALE:Big Daddy didn't sound sick when I talked to him.
SUPFEMALE:He was just missing me.
LEADMALE:That Virginia's always accusing me of not being there when the family needs me.
SUPFEMALE:This is just her way of getting me to rush home.
LEADFEMALE:Believe me, everything's fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, just the same, Blanche, I think I'd better go to Atlanta with you.
LEADMALE:Whatever you want to do.
SUPFEMALE:Ketchup to go on my lima beans.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Oh, he sometimes ate 'em that way.
LEADMALE:He'd make up stories about how that's the way the kings and queens of Europe ate 'em.
LEADFEMALE:He always made it sound so special.
SUPMALE:He always made everything sound so damned special.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, God, why didn't I go when he called? Why didn't I go? And this is the living room.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, it's a lovely home.
LEADMALE:I better go check and see if the water for our tea is boiling.
OTHERFEMALE:There's so many memories connected to this room.
OTHERFEMALE:We used to have our big family reunions in here.
LEADFEMALE:Generations of Hollingsworths would gather round Big Daddy with his bourbon.
LEADFEMALE:While he sat there in front of a roaring fire regaling everybody with stories of the Old South, I'd sneak away up to my room and make out with cousin Abernathy.
LEADMALE:The room has that sense of tradition.
LEADFEMALE:Virginia.
LEADMALE:Hello, Blanche, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Virginia, so sorry about your father.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Nice of you to come.
LEADFEMALE:I was just going to make tea.
SUPMALE:Anybody want anything else? Oh, not me, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm too upset to eat.
OTHERFEMALE:I may never eat again.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're right, I should keep up my strength.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, something with frosting.
LEADFEMALE:Come here, sister, and give me a big hug.
LEADMALE:It's just a little late to be sharing a beautiful moment, don't you think? Where were you, Blanche? He wanted you.
SUPFEMALE:He did not sound that sick on the phone.
LEADMALE:Besides, I told him I'd be here to see him soon.
LEADFEMALE:And don't you get so righteous with me.
SUPMALE:Plenty of times you weren't there for him.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talking about? Always trying to make me out to be the inconsiderate one.
LEADFEMALE:I remember when you were 16 and didn't come home for Father's Day.
LEADMALE:I was away at school.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:The Good Samaritan Academy for the Knocked-Up.
LEADFEMALE:Two, four, six, eight, all us girls are three months late.
LEADFEMALE:That was wonderful for him.
SUPMALE:Didn't hurt him half as much as when you were 18, went off to Europe with that guy, Phil.
LEADFEMALE:It was Philippe.
LEADFEMALE:And Big Daddy understood how romantic it was to go live in Copenhagen with a tortured painter.
LEADFEMALE:He painted houses, Blanche.
LEADMALE:You are the one who has never been here for the family.
OTHERMALE:You.
LEADFEMALE:I have always been here for this family, and how dare you say otherwise.
SUPMALE:Everything you do is for Blanche.
LEADMALE:To tell you the truth, I am surprised that you even made it to the funeral at all.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you would have been happier if I hadn't.
LEADMALE:Maybe not happier.
LEADMALE:But at least this family would be able to grieve for Big Daddy without wondering what is in it for Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, fine.
LEADMALE:You don't have a thing to worry about.
LEADMALE:You won't have to think about Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Because if you're gonna be at that funeral I refuse to go.
SUPMALE:OK, I want to go over a few of the house rules.
LEADFEMALE:You share the bathroom with Dorothy's room.
SUPMALE:The people across the street are out of town so you can use their pool.
LEADFEMALE:They're friends of ours, so try and pick up after yourselves.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Oh! Oh, I'm sorry, but you're not supposed to eat off that plate.
LEADFEMALE:That's Blanche's Citrus Festival plate.
LEADMALE:Are you staying here too? We're in the room at the end of the hall.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Peter, this is my wife, Maddy.
LEADMALE:What room are you in? I'd better check.
LEADMALE:Sophia, who are Peter and Maddy and why are they staying in Blanche's room? Because Dorothy's room and your room are already rented.
SUPFEMALE:Well, where am I gonna sleep? I could rent you half of my room.
LEADMALE:Sophia, you can't do this.
LEADMALE:Dorothy said-- Forget about what Dorothy said.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want me to do? Kick them out? There's not a room in town.
SUPFEMALE:These people come from a small town in Iowa, much like St.
SUPFEMALE:Olaf.
LEADMALE:Really? I don't lie about stuff like this, Rose.
OTHERMALE:The good people in that town saved and sacrificed so that Peter and Maddy could have one weekend of fun before his operation.
SUPMALE:Well, he looks fine.
LEADMALE:Oh, tell him that.
OTHERMALE:Look, call me crazy.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't see anything wrong with giving a veteran his last wish, and making some dough.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess they can stay.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Here, take this out there, make sure they pay.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I don't think it's right to charge them.
LEADFEMALE:Neither do I, but he hates pity.
SUPMALE:I understand.
LEADFEMALE:What a tool.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, if you want to change your mind, there's still time to get to the funeral.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, come look at these old pictures.
LEADMALE:I'm about ten years old in this one.
OTHERFEMALE:Big Daddy just taught me how to ride a horse.
LEADMALE:You were quite a little porker back then, weren't you? I was a little chunky, that's all.
LEADMALE:Blanche, the horse's eyes are crossed.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:You were fat.
LEADMALE:Every little girl goes through that ugly stage.
LEADMALE:Ugly, yes.
OTHERMALE:But this is ugly and fat.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:You seem to be getting a little bit too much pleasure out of all this.
SUPMALE:Sorry, Blanche.
SUPMALE:It's just that you've always described yourself as being a great beauty.
LEADFEMALE:It's interesting to see that you were Plump.
SUPMALE:fat.
LEADMALE:Enough.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Fat, fat, water rat, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:All right, I'll stop.
LEADFEMALE:I'll stop.
OTHERMALE:But could I have a copy of this? All right, I was fat.
OTHERFEMALE:I can say it.
SUPFEMALE:But only because I blossomed into the extraordinary woman I am today.
LEADMALE:Well, Big Daddy didn't care.
LEADMALE:He always said I was beautiful.
LEADMALE:He was so proud.
SUPMALE:You know, there's nobody to be proud of me anymore, you know what I mean? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, when anything good happens to me, I still can't wait to tell Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, Blanche, I think you have to go to the funeral.
LEADMALE:You wanted to be there for him, be there for him now.
LEADFEMALE:Don't let this argument with Virginia stand in your way.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, you're never gonna feel complete until you get to say goodbye.
LEADMALE:You don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:If I go to that funeral, he's dead.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, he is.
LEADMALE:Look here.
LEADFEMALE:This is when I was crowned Azalea Queen.
LEADFEMALE:Wasn't I beautiful then? And you still haven't lost it.
OTHERFEMALE:Actually, this picture was taken two years after I lost it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Look.
LEADMALE:Aw!  The first marine he found the bean, parlez-vous? The second marine, he cooked the bean, parlez-vous? The third marine, he ate the bean, rolled over the submarine Inky-dinky parlez-vous?  Oh, nice people.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, you didn't say anything about parties in the house.
LEADMALE:Oh, so Peter and Maddy are having a few friends over.
OTHERFEMALE:We're making a bundle.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I wish we had thought of putting in a pay toilet.
LEADMALE: Hello? It was Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Hide me.
SUPFEMALE: Rose, you answer it.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna answer it.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to have to lie for you.
OTHERFEMALE:It's your daughter.
SUPMALE:We're not that close.
SUPMALE:You better answer it the next time.
LEADMALE:She's gonna get mad.
LEADFEMALE: Hello? Oh, hello, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:No, it didn't ring here.
LEADMALE:Why? No, everything's fine here.
SUPMALE:Sophia?  Tell her I'm in church.
SUPMALE: She's in church.
LEADFEMALE:I said, she's in church.
SUPMALE:No, things couldn't be better here.
LEADMALE:How's it going there? Oh, that's good.
LEADFEMALE:Then I'll see you tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Give my love to Blanche.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPMALE:I hate lying! It goes against my nature.
LEADFEMALE:I guess that's because growing up in St.
SUPFEMALE:Olaf, one day every year, they'd gather all the children who lied in the town square and the mayor would point at them.
LEADFEMALE: Uh, you got any glue? Oh! Blanche's plate! What are we gonna tell her? The truth.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:I just need a few minutes to come up with it.
LEADFEMALE:These are for you, Mama.
SUPMALE:Hi, Big Daddy.
SUPMALE:I couldn't go home without telling you why I didn't come to your funeral.
LEADMALE:Same old reason.
LEADFEMALE:I was being selfish.
OTHERMALE:Thinking too much about how I was feeling, instead of coming out here to pay my loving respects.
SUPFEMALE:You know, going through those photograph albums yesterday, with Dorothy, I realized that I haven't always been easy to love.
LEADMALE:Oh, I was a horrible child.
LEADFEMALE:Rebellious, difficult.
LEADFEMALE:But you always made me feel loved and beautiful.
LEADMALE:Even when I did make it hard on you.
LEADFEMALE:I know I haven't always given much back, honey.
LEADMALE:I was always so worried about me.
OTHERFEMALE:Why, I couldn't even come and see you when you needed me, before you died, 'cause I was all caught up in that old silly ball.
OTHERFEMALE:There is no excuse for that.
LEADFEMALE:Although I was the ball queen, did I tell you that? Oh, that's right, I did.
LEADMALE:Well, here I am, all caught up in myself still.
SUPFEMALE:Fighting with Virginia and the rest of the family when we ought to be comforting each other.
LEADMALE:I just feel like such a fool.
LEADFEMALE:I would give up everything that I ever thought meant anything to me if I could have one moment with you.
SUPMALE:I don't know if love can help you, wherever you are, but if it can, honey, you got it.
LEADFEMALE:'Cause Big Daddy, I do love you so much.
LEADFEMALE:I just wish there was some way I could know you're hearing what I'm saying.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche Oh, Lordy Why, Dorothy, what are you doing? I'm sorry, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Cab driver says we'd better get going if we want to make our plane.
LEADMALE:Big Daddy, you remember Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, I have to go now.
LEADMALE:You're in my prayers.
LEADMALE:You take good care of him, Mama.
LEADFEMALE:You hear me? I love you.
SUPFEMALE:I love you both.
SUPMALE:I'm nobody's little girl anymore.
SUPMALE:Rose, this was a great weekend! We made $1700.
OTHERFEMALE:So I can get my TV.
SUPMALE:And I've worked out what we can tell Blanche about that plate.
LEADMALE:I wrote it down.
OTHERMALE:You be Rose, why don't I be Sophia.
OTHERFEMALE:This is what we'll say right after they walk in the door.
LEADMALE:"Hi, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:You look beautiful.
SUPFEMALE:Welcome home.
LEADMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:" "I broke the plate.
LEADMALE:I'm such a clumsy fool.
SUPMALE:" OK.
OTHERMALE:Now you can skip down to here.
OTHERMALE:I'm not gonna do this! You gotta.
OTHERFEMALE: If it's the writing, I can punch it up.
SUPFEMALE:Did you call about buying the Citrus Festival plate? Yes, I did.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:You're beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:How much do you want for it? Well, they're pretty rare.
LEADMALE:There's only five of these.
LEADFEMALE:I'd say $2000.
SUPFEMALE:$2000 a plate? What is this? A Republican fundraiser? Look, these plates are collector's items.
SUPMALE:I'm only doing this because you've said you're in a jam.
LEADMALE:Sir, we have $1700 cash.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take it.
SUPFEMALE:Give him the money, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:But my TV.
LEADMALE:How about a hundred dollars and we'll show you a good time? Give him the money.
LEADMALE:Nice doing business with you.
SUPMALE:Hello, everybody.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello there.
LEADMALE:Who was that? Gasman.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it's so good to see you both home.
OTHERMALE:We took good care of your plate, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADMALE:You know, I became a new person on this trip.
LEADFEMALE:I realized that we have so little time while we're here together, we must cherish each and every moment.
LEADFEMALE:Now, this plate represents the old me.
LEADMALE:I feel wonderful.
LEADMALE:I could go for some cheesecake.
LEADMALE:What is this? Sarcasm? 
SUPFEMALE:
