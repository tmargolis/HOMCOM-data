SUPMALE:It's just that I'm so anxious about meeting this guy that Kate's bringing.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think it's serious? Well, they've been together now for six months.
LEADFEMALE:That's the longest she's been interested in any man since Paul McCartney.
SUPMALE:Kate dated Paul McCartney? Yes, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:They wanted to get engaged, but I insisted that she finish grade school.
LEADMALE:Do you know anything about this boy's family background? - All I know is that he's a doctor.
SUPFEMALE:- A doctor! The heck with his background! Do you have any idea how much a doctor makes these days? No, I really don't care what he does for a living.
LEADMALE:I mean, the important thing is that he and Kate have a good relationship.
LEADFEMALE:(doorbell 'Course if they happen to get married, I will shout from every rooftop in Miami, "My son-in-law's a doctor!" - Hi, Mom! - Oh, baby! Oh, it is so good to see you! Oh, look everybody, look who's here! - You look glorious! - Where is he? Where's your doctor? Dennis is at a seminar.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bring him by tomorrow.
LEADMALE:- I can't find my culottes! - Grandma, you look sensational! Relax, relax, you're already in the will! Before anyone does anything, I have a big announcement to make.
SUPFEMALE:As my mother has undoubtedly already told you and the rest of Miami, for the past six months, I've been seeing a doctor named Dennis.
LEADMALE:That's your big announcement? You call your doctor by his first name? Ma, Ma, he's her boyfriend.
SUPFEMALE:He just happens to be a doctor, OK? Fine! What's the point? The day after tomorrow, Dennis and I are flying to the Bahamas - and we're getting married.

OTHERMALE:You are not getting married on an island by a priest wearing clam diggers You'll get married right here in Miami.
SUPMALE:Kate, I could put together a lovely reception here at the house.
LEADFEMALE:And I could take care of the catering! I have always dreamed of wearing a long, white gown and marching down the aisle on my father's arm.
LEADFEMALE:Who said anything about inviting your father? It wouldn't be much of a wedding without both of my parents there.
LEADFEMALE:Even if we got live doves? - Mother! - Oh, all right, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Your wedding day should be the most beautiful day of your life.
LEADMALE:And if you want to invite your father, I'm willing to keep the peace.
LEADMALE:- Promise? - Promise.
LEADFEMALE:Then it's settled.
LEADFEMALE:Now call your father and tell the dirt bag he can come.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it, Mom.
OTHERMALE:I can just as easily limbo down the aisle.
SUPMALE:Relax honey.
LEADMALE:I just want to get it all out of my system before he gets here.
LEADFEMALE:- Now go ahead, call him.
SUPMALE:- I'll call him.
OTHERMALE:You talk to him.

OTHERMALE:Hold on.
SUPMALE:- Dorothy, you were magnificent! - You certainly were! How did you do it? I just kept telling myself that once he was here, he'd be close enough to kill.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe Stan has the nerve to show his face at this wedding! The man has a right to see his daughter get married! - I never should have called him.
SUPMALE:- You never should have married him! - Hi, hi, hi! - Oh, hi, Blanche.

OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, no, honey! - You're using too much rice! - Fine! This elf quits! I never understood why people throw rice at weddings anyway.

LEADFEMALE:- Oh, Dorothy! Oh, that's right! I'm not saying this because she is my daughter, but she was the best Abraham Lincoln the third grade ever saw.
OTHERMALE:No, when she freed the second grade, there was not a dry eye in the house.
LEADFEMALE:Somehow I just can't picture Kate as Abraham Lincoln.
LEADMALE:Oh, Stan, do me a favor? Take off your hair and hold it up to Kate's chin.
LEADMALE:- Mother, you promised! - I know, I know.
LEADMALE:Just ignore me, Stan.
LEADFEMALE:It should be easy.

LEADFEMALE:Princess, before I forget, I want to invite you and Dennis to come spend some time with Chrissy and me in our new house in Maui.
LEADMALE:- That sounds great! - Yeah, yeah, it's primo! Listen, I have some pictures.
OTHERFEMALE:Take a look at that stretch of beach, huh? That's our house.

LEADMALE:That's Chrissy in a hot tub.
LEADFEMALE:That's me and Chrissy at a luau.
SUPMALE:Is she the one with the apple in her mouth? Ma! You know, she looks pretty good for being in the ground for two hours.
LEADFEMALE:- Rose, Rose, what are you doing? - Watching the cheese balls.
SUPMALE:- You're supposed to be watching Dorothy! - I was watching Dorothy! But every time I watch her, Sophia eats a cheese ball.
LEADMALE:Honey, let her have the darn cheese balls.
SUPMALE:Nobody else wants them! - Cheese ball, Father? - Oh, yes, thank you very much.
SUPMALE:Now I know what I'm giving up for Lent! Stanley, would you be a dear and get me some champagne? It's always a pleasure to get a drink for an attractive woman.
SUPMALE:I'll get one for you too, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Would you excuse us? Have you ever met a man who knows how to push all your buttons? Just once.
LEADFEMALE:He was a cabana boy in Pensacola.
LEADMALE:I am never going to get through this.
OTHERMALE:I just hate him too much.
SUPFEMALE:- I know I'm gonna do something crazy! - You just simmer down, missy.
OTHERMALE:Sit down here.
LEADFEMALE:I want to talk to you, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Listen, I know this isn't easy for you, so I'm gonna let you in on a sorority secret that was passed on to me at Miss MacGyver's Finishing School.
LEADMALE:Now, whenever you feel you're about to lose control, just take my hand and give it a little squeeze.
SUPMALE:I guarantee you'll feel 100% better.
SUPFEMALE:And that's the big secret? Oh, no! The big secret was that Miss MacGyver and Miss McKinney were sharing a one-bedroom apartment off campus.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, will you Here you go, ladies.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, would you like some hors d'oeuvres? - No, thank you, Stan.

LEADMALE:Well, then, I'd like to make a toast.
SUPFEMALE:Your attention please, everybody.
LEADMALE:To my son-in-law and my daughter - may she be as happy with her new life mate as I am with mine.
LEADMALE:Hear, hear! Blanche, don't you think it's time we cut the cake? Oh, yes, I do, Rose! Who invited the priest? You know I can't cut loose with a priest around.
OTHERMALE:Sophia, he happens to be a very nice man.
LEADFEMALE:He gives me the creeps.
LEADFEMALE:He's been following me.
OTHERMALE:They always follow the old people.
LEADFEMALE:It's like parking tickets.
SUPMALE:They got a last rites quota.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, there you are.
LEADFEMALE:I've been looking all over for you.
LEADFEMALE:Buzz off, Padre.
LEADFEMALE:- Rose, where's Dorothy? - I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:She was here a minute ago.
SUPFEMALE:- Uh-oh.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, my God! - Give me that knife! - What are you doing? I can't let you go through with this!

Cut the wedd Oh, I thought you were gonna stab Stan.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be ridiculous! Do you honestly believe I would stab Stan at my own daughter's wedding? - Oh, no, I guess not.
LEADMALE:- Well, of course not! I would wait until after the wedding.
LEADFEMALE:There are too many witnesses.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no! - Kidding - Oh, don't do that to me! - What are you doing? - I just want to be by myself for awhile.
SUPFEMALE:- It's time to throw rice at the kids.
SUPMALE:- I don't think I can go back out there.
SUPMALE:- You're acting like a jerk.
LEADFEMALE:- Thanks, Ma.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:That really makes me feel a lot better.
SUPFEMALE:Don't get smart with your mother! Listen, Dorothy, I love you dearly, but you're not the first woman to be dumped by her husband.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma, Ma, it's not what he did.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I've learned to live with that.
LEADMALE:It's the way he did it.
LEADFEMALE:The least he could have done was tell me to my face.
LEADFEMALE:If you're so angry with him, tell him.
OTHERMALE:You don't have to kill him.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:But I want to.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, anger is a lot like a piece of shredded wheat caught under your dentures.
SUPFEMALE:If you leave it there, you get a blister and you gotta eat Jell-O all week.
SUPFEMALE:If you get rid of it, the sore heals, and you feel better.
LEADMALE:Anger is like a piece of shredded wheat? You want poetry, you listen to Neil Diamond.
OTHERMALE:You want good advice? You listen to your mother.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you're right.
SUPMALE:Of course I'm right.
LEADMALE:You think I got this old by being stupid? You know, you're the greatest mother in the world.
LEADMALE:Tell me something I don't know.
LEADMALE:(overlapping chatter Well, Mother, I guess this is it.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye, sweetheart! Now listen, you be a good wife, you hear? Be his friend, be his lover.

SUPFEMALE:I'd like to talk to you.
OTHERMALE:Well, sure, OK.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go where we can have some privacy.
LEADFEMALE:Have a seat.
SUPMALE:What can I do for you? The first thing you can do is get rid of that ridiculous toupee.
LEADFEMALE:I want to speak to the bald guy who left me.
OTHERMALE:Ow! What's the matter with you? - You walked out on me, Stanley Zbornak! - Now I know why.
LEADFEMALE:You walked out on me and you didn't have the decency to tell me you were leaving.
LEADMALE:I heard it from some lawyer over the telephone.
LEADFEMALE:A stranger, Stanley, a total stranger, told me that my marriage was over.
LEADFEMALE:- Dorothy, look, things happened.
LEADFEMALE:- Things happened? You're damn right things happened.
SUPMALE:and dreaming and fighting and loving and children and diapers and school plays and Little League.
LEADFEMALE:And worrying if you'd get through your gallbladder surgery.
SUPFEMALE:And wondering if I'd get through another Sunday dinner at your mother's house.
LEADFEMALE:And the lean years, when the business failed.
SUPMALE:And the good years, and the happy Christmases.
LEADFEMALE:All those things happened.
OTHERFEMALE:And because they happened, I deserved better than a stinking phone call from my husband's legal representative.
OTHERMALE:You had a choice and you took the easy way out.
SUPFEMALE:And it was a rotten thing to do! But now you're here in front of me and you can't run away.
SUPFEMALE:And I finally get to have what you tried to cheat me out of.
SUPMALE:I finally get to say goodbye, Stanley.
SUPMALE:- Look, Dorothy, we - I said goodbye, Stanley.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, we just saw Stanley leaving.
SUPMALE:Are you all right? - I'm fine.
LEADMALE:- I wouldn't be fine! I don't know what I'd have done if Charlie had suddenly paid a visit! He's dead! You would have fainted! Are you Are you really all right? I'm feeling a little better.
LEADMALE:And tomorrow you're gonna feel a lot better.
LEADMALE:And the next day, maybe better still.
LEADMALE:- And the next day, maybe - That's right, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:And then one day, Stanley's gonna be out of your life completely.
SUPFEMALE:Not completely.
LEADMALE:There will always be a little part of him that stays with me.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:After 38 years, there are always bound to be - some memories that stay with you.
SUPMALE:- I wasn't talking about memories.
LEADFEMALE:I was talking about this.
LEADMALE:
