LEADFEMALE: I'm not happy with my zabagliones.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you just need a push-up bra.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, zabaglione is a traditional Italian dessert.
LEADFEMALE:It's my Uncle Angelo's favorite.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, my brother.
LEADFEMALE:He's quite the scungiscoror-or-or.
LEADMALE:Even I don't know that one.
LEADMALE:That wasn't a word.
OTHERFEMALE:My dentures slipped.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, Uncle Angelo's plane lands at 4:00.
LEADMALE:You have plenty of time to make a fresh batch before then.
LEADMALE:Good, because these aren't fit for human consumption.
LEADFEMALE:Top of the morning, sunshines.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Rose, try one of these.
SUPMALE:Oh, no thanks.
LEADMALE:I'm doing what we all should be doing/n dieting for the bachelorette auction next Saturday.
SUPFEMALE:Not all of us.
OTHERFEMALE:I told you, Rose, count me out.
LEADFEMALE:Even if it is for charity, I am not gonna stand up there and allow myself to be sold to the highest bidder like some Holstein cow at a livestock auction.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, livestock don't get chauffeur-driven limousine rides to fancy four-star restaurants and the symphony afterwards.
LEADFEMALE:Except during St.
LEADMALE:Olaf Bicentennial Day.
SUPMALE:Rose, I am not going.
SUPFEMALE:It is degrading.
OTHERMALE:Don't be a stick-in-the-mud.
SUPMALE:It's for the Children's Hospital.
LEADFEMALE:If you can't degrade yourself for a bunch of sick kids, who can you degrade yourself for? Listen to this.
SUPFEMALE:Eleanor Roosevelt in a garter belt.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you can't tell us that a part of you isn't at least a little excited.
LEADMALE:Remember last year's auction? That rush of euphoria when the auctioneer calls out "Sold!" and you fall into the arms of your valiant Galahad? My Galahad was a balloon salesman named Sid.
LEADMALE:Well, hey, who knew that sawed-off little gnome would outbid a Navy admiral? And a fire chief.
LEADFEMALE:And that jeweler who was a dead ringer for Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Richard Widmark.
SUPFEMALE:That was a year ago.
OTHERFEMALE:How do you remember all this? I tagged 'em for migratory purposes.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, come on.
LEADFEMALE:The auction needs you.
SUPFEMALE:The children need you.
LEADMALE:Please, won't you reconsider? Oh, all right! It's only one night.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go, but I'll tell you, I really hate this.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Dorothy, that balloon man couldn't have been that terrible.
SUPFEMALE:I got the feeling I was the man's first date that wasn't inflatable.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I have an idea.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy just did something really nice for us.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we do something nice for her? Why don't we buy her a man? Well, I'm in, and I know just the person.
SUPFEMALE:Free every Saturday night Oh, wait, that's a woman.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, wait, that's Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:No, I meant for the auction, so she won't get stuck with another loser.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, that's not a bad idea.
LEADFEMALE:We were all gonna donate money anyway.
LEADFEMALE:We could chip in, say, 50 bucks and buy her the bull of the ball.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, but who do we know who knows a man? Blanche, you know hundreds of men.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:I just like to hear you say it.
SUPFEMALE: Hiya, sweetie pie.
OTHERMALE:How ya doin'? Fine, cupcake.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for asking.
LEADMALE:  Dorothy, I know you're in there.
LEADMALE: You always could slam a door.
LEADFEMALE:That's one of the things I love about you.
OTHERFEMALE:You flatter me.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, wait.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, I have to talk to you.
SUPFEMALE:This wouldn't happen to be an apology for ruining our wedding, would it? No, just something I thought I should tell you in person.
LEADMALE:Remember my Uncle Morris? Dorothy, he died.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you smell good.
LEADFEMALE:Get away from me.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:You don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:Something wonderful has happened.
LEADMALE:In his will, Uncle Morris left us an apartment building/n jointly.
SUPMALE:We're partners.
LEADMALE:Don't you see, Dorothy? We'll be together, and we'll have a place of our own.
OTHERMALE:Oh, God, he's proposing to her again.
LEADFEMALE:Will one of you raise your standards, please?! Sophia, I'm not proposing.
OTHERMALE:I'm here because Dorothy and I just inherited an apartment building.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna be landlords together.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not a very big building, but she'll still clear a couple hundred bucks a month.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, this is wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:With that kind of money, we can hire a really good-lookin' gardener.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, it really does sound like a great opportunity.
LEADMALE:On Stan's behalf, Charlie once made a lot of money in business with a partner who was also a lousy, no-good, underhanded, backstabbing worm.
LEADMALE:Let me guess, Rose.
SUPMALE:Ivan Boesky-Vanderfloovenhooven- meistergarbengerbenfleckman.
LEADFEMALE:That's the louse.
LEADFEMALE:So, um, what do you say, babe? Partners? Goodbye, Stan.
SUPFEMALE:OK.
SUPMALE:I get the message.
SUPMALE:I guess I'm just not a person you want in your life.
LEADFEMALE:Am I? Goodbye, Stan.
LEADFEMALE:Can you believe this guy? Like I would think for a minute about being in business with him.
LEADMALE:Nonsense, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:You can't pass up a chance to own real estate.
LEADFEMALE:It's been a lifesaver for me.
OTHERFEMALE:You get a bunch of saps to pay your mortgage for you every month while your equity just rises higher and higher, while those poor suckers/n What I meant was it's a great opportunity to make new friends.
SUPMALE:Look who's here.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, buon giorno, Rosa.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, Blanche.
SUPMALE: Oh, my goodness.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't been hugged so much since V-E Day.
LEADMALE:Which was kinda tricky, because as you know, we lost.
LEADMALE:Angelo, you're even handsomer than you were your last visit.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I been plucking, eh? See? I got two eyebrows now.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody loves 'em.
SUPFEMALE:You sit right down here, Angelo.
SUPFEMALE:I got a surprise for you/n zabaglione.
LEADMALE:Your favorite.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm.
LEADMALE: Sophia.
SUPMALE:And that's the new batch.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I cannot pretend no more.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Angelo, what's wrong? It's a long sad story, a story of love, a story of deception, a story of a fool.
LEADFEMALE:You know the story of Elsie Holdenfelder? Absolutely, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:That one's even more popular in Europe than it is here.
LEADFEMALE:I met a beautiful young Sicilian aerobics instructor.
SUPFEMALE:Gorgeous eyes, angelic mouth and a behind that must have been made on a Saturday because even the good Lord himself would want to take a day off to admire it.
LEADFEMALE:I lost my heart and I opened my wallet, eh? Oh dear, the expensive gifts and fancy dinners and weekends in Mykonos, eh? I even wore one of those, uh, tiny Speedo swimsuits, shows all your gingerbread and everything.
LEADMALE:And she leaves me.
LEADFEMALE:What does a 6'7" American basketball player got that I don't? Well, Angelo, speaking in terms of the gingerbread alone Blanche! Go ahead, Uncle Angelo.
SUPMALE:Anyway, I spend so much money on this girl, I forget about my business.
LEADFEMALE:The bank foreclosed, leaving me flat broke.
LEADFEMALE:I got no savings, no place to live.
SUPFEMALE:And I gotta tell you, a lot of women find this a negative.
LEADMALE:It's a family curse, this obsession with women.
LEADFEMALE:The men in our family are weak.
LEADMALE:Why couldn't they all be more like Cousin Antony? Ma, Cousin Antony had an obsession with men in cowboy hats who hung around Times Square.
LEADFEMALE:What am I gonna do? You're gonna trust in your family, because family is there when you're down, and family stops at nothing!/n nothing to help one of their own.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, I want my brother Angelo to come here and live with us.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, Sophia.
SUPMALE:There's just no room.
OTHERMALE:Hey, I tried.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:You're a landlord now.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe there's a vacancy in your new building.
LEADFEMALE:Don't call it my building.
LEADMALE:I don't even know if I'm gonna hang on to it yet.
SUPMALE:I I I understand.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, any mail I get, just address it "Guy in the Gutter, Post Office Box Anywhere.
LEADMALE:" All right.
SUPFEMALE:All right, all right, Uncle Angelo.
LEADFEMALE:For the time being, I guess you can use Uncle Morris' old apartment.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, thank you so much.
LEADMALE:My first apartment in America.
LEADMALE:Here I will begin again.
LEADFEMALE:Here I will start a new life.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, my new life/n how close I'm gonna start it to the beach? Going once.
LEADMALE:Going twice You still want to tell me this isn't degrading? Don't be ridiculous.
LEADMALE:It's for charity.
LEADMALE:Sold! For $4.
LEADMALE:Well, it's degrading if you don't hit double figures.
LEADFEMALE:I really appreciate your bidding on Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:It's for a good cause.
SUPMALE:You'll be rewarded.
OTHERMALE:Not in this lifetime "Variety is the watchword for our next bachelorette" Dorothy Zbornak.
LEADMALE:Come on up, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:This is perfect.
SUPFEMALE:The way the bidding's going, we won't be out more than $20, $30 apiece.
LEADMALE:"If Dorothy's not off winging her way to Molokai "to assist Father Damian in his work with the lepers, you can find her hang-gliding high above the Florida Keys.
SUPMALE:" Rose, where did you get that? From your mother.
LEADFEMALE:Before she and I talked, I wasn't aware of any of it.
LEADMALE:"She's a scratch golfer who, under President Jimmy Carter, "served as the United States Senate Majority Whip.
SUPFEMALE:And she likes to read.
SUPFEMALE:" I figured, close with the truth.
SUPFEMALE:It'll kind of anchor the rest.
SUPMALE:I want to thank you all for holding this event on a night when my hang glider is in the shop and, uh, Congress is in recess and the lepers are on Geraldo.
LEADMALE:Go ahead, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Right, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Now, let's start the bidding at $5.
OTHERMALE:$5.
SUPFEMALE:$100.
OTHERMALE:Stanley, what are you doing here? I'm buying a date with the woman I love.
LEADMALE:Oh, jeez.
LEADFEMALE:Not in front of people.
OTHERMALE:What the hell is he doing? Didn't you give him a limit? this man removed.
SUPMALE:He's a lonely male impersonator.
SUPFEMALE:What?! What is wrong with you? The woman's been with lepers.
SUPMALE:Stanley, stop it.
LEADMALE:I am not going out with you.
SUPFEMALE:I would rather be bound and gagged and left on an anthill covered with honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Sold.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, I say that.
LEADMALE:Sold! She says that.
LEADMALE:Rose, do something.
SUPMALE:Sold! Sorry, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:That's $500 for the Children's Hospital.
SUPFEMALE:I guess dreams really can come true.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, here's something that'll get your mind off Stan.
LEADFEMALE:According to my calculations, allowing for overhead, tonight brought in a grand total of $50.
LEADMALE:No, $500.
SUPMALE:5,000.
LEADFEMALE:It's 5,000, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:Decimal points don't have six legs.
LEADMALE:More than 10% of it thanks to Dorothy here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, who's keeping score? What's important is that we made a lot of money.
LEADFEMALE:Together we made a consid- They were fighting over me.
LEADFEMALE:Did you see it? Well, Dorothy, to be fair, one of 'em was Stan.
LEADMALE:Do I sense a tinge of envy there, Miss "going, going, gone" for 25.
LEADMALE:50? You can't put a price tag on beauty, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:Oh, sure you can/n 25.
SUPFEMALE:50.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:No, I'm not blaming any of this on you.
LEADMALE:It's all my fault for giving Stan so many chances.
LEADFEMALE:But I can't do this again.
OTHERMALE:I mean, how many times can I make the same mistake? How many times can you bang your head against the wall before it starts to bleed? Nine.
LEADMALE:Believe me, Dorothy, I know what you're going through.
SUPFEMALE:I once had a relationship with a man I couldn't get rid of.
LEADFEMALE:Every time I turned around, there he was, pathetically underfoot.
OTHERMALE:Long after I outgrew my need for him, he was there with flowers and candy, perfume.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't move without him following me like a puppy dog.
SUPFEMALE:How'd you finally get rid of him? Monday came, and we both had to go back to work.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:And thank you too, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:What did I say? Nothing.
SUPMALE:And I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
SUPMALE:Ah, Dorothy, I want to talk to you about my apartment.
LEADMALE:Ah, I'm grateful.
OTHERFEMALE:I love where I live.
OTHERFEMALE:And the last thing I want to do is come to you with every little problem.
LEADFEMALE:And now your mother would like to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, you're making my brother live like a peasant.
LEADMALE:He has no closet space.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Angelo, you moved in with one suitcase.
LEADMALE:What do you need with more closets? I don't like to talk about my brother's personal life, but a man brings a woman home, how is he supposed to play a decent game of hide and-go-seek? Under the table, behind the couch Bambi was on to me like that.
OTHERFEMALE:And then there's the water pressure.
SUPFEMALE:I got more water pressure than this apartment.
LEADMALE:And another thing/n W-Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Why is any of this your business? He's my brother.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'm your daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I've known you, what, 60 years? Angelo I've known 85.
SUPMALE:To tell you the truth, I don't quite trust you yet.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Angelo, in the past three days you have complained about everything in the apartment except the rent.
LEADFEMALE:Reason being you don't pay any.
LEADMALE:I told you she'd throw it in our face.
SUPFEMALE:And speaking of complaints, what about that out-of control housewarming party that kept all the other tenants awake until dawn? The one I was not invited to? That wasn't a party.
LEADFEMALE:That was a quiet dinner for two.
LEADMALE:Hi there, Angelo.
LEADMALE:Well, Rose and I are ready for our date.
SUPMALE:I just think it's so sweet the way the mariachi band all chipped in to go on a double date with Rose and me.
SUPFEMALE: Here they are now.
OTHERMALE:Angelo, great party the other night.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you look great in a tux.
LEADFEMALE:It wasn't your kind of crowd, Pussycat.
LEADMALE:That's funny.
SUPMALE:It's the same excuse you used when you didn't invite me to my Sweet 16.
LEADFEMALE:Now, that was a party.
LEADFEMALE: Hi, it's me Stan/n from the fund-raiser? I remember.
SUPMALE:Come on in.
LEADMALE:Uncle Angelo, Ma, I hope you don't mind.
SUPMALE:Stan and I are going to go into the kitchen and talk.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, great party the other night, Angelo.
OTHERMALE:Stanley, I appreciate you coming here tonight, but I've decided I'm not going out with you.
LEADFEMALE:But I won the bidding at the auction.
SUPFEMALE:I understand that.
LEADMALE:But there's nothing you can say to make me change my mind.
LEADFEMALE:You owe me $500.
LEADMALE:How about Thai food? That sounds great.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait, wait, wait.
SUPFEMALE:I said I'm not going to go, and I am not going to go.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that, well, you have different intentions than I do.
SUPMALE:It's not my intentions, it's God's intentions.
SUPMALE:D-Do you think this is all a coincidence? I mean, look/n your uncle visits, my uncle dies.
SUPMALE:Your uncle needs a place to live, my uncle gives us a building.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you see? God wants us to be together, babe.
OTHERMALE:It's almost Biblical.
OTHERFEMALE:And thus he smote your Uncle Morris, huh? There's a whole school of thought that says he's a wrathful God.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well that would explain your hair.
OTHERFEMALE:Stanley, pay attention.
LEADFEMALE:No date tonight.
SUPMALE:OK, I guess I'll just have to go through my life without you in it.
OTHERFEMALE:Stanley, I am in it.
LEADMALE:We're business partners.
LEADMALE:That's the extent of it.
SUPFEMALE:You understand? OK.
OTHERMALE:OK, I give up.
LEADFEMALE:Business partners.
OTHERFEMALE:I understand.
LEADFEMALE:Can we shake on it? I need you, Dorothy! I want you! Without you, I'm nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Do you hear me? Nothing.
LEADMALE:Stan, as much of a turn on as this is, get off the floor.
LEADMALE:I belong on the floor if I've driven you out of my life.
LEADFEMALE:From this moment on, the floor is my home.
SUPMALE:Enjoy.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy! I can explain, Ma No need to, Pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:Let's move quick before the cops get here.
LEADMALE:You wipe for fingerprints, I'll get a shovel and a Hefty bag.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great.
OTHERMALE:It figures you couldn't finish the job.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go get the toaster.
SUPFEMALE:Ow! Ow! Sophia, I'm not dead.
LEADMALE:Not yet.
SUPFEMALE:Would you slow down? I'm an old woman! Stan, I want no part of any of this.
OTHERMALE:I am out.
SUPMALE:I am selling my half of the building.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
OTHERMALE:I'm glad.
SUPMALE:I'll tear the dump down and turn it into office space for Zbornak, Incorporated.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Fine! Don't blame me that it means throwing your uncle out on the street.
SUPFEMALE:Stan, that's blackmail.
SUPFEMALE:But it's got a certain logic.
LEADFEMALE:So, business partners? I have no choice.
LEADMALE:Business partners.
SUPMALE:And dinner? Absolutely not.
LEADMALE:Stanley, you claim that you have changed.
LEADFEMALE:Well, so have I.
LEADMALE:Stan, I have finally come to realize that no matter how hard you try, you cannot fix something that no longer works.
OTHERFEMALE:I've learned to let go, Stanley.
LEADMALE:Dorothy And you should, too.
LEADMALE:I don't know if I can do it.
LEADFEMALE:If that guy at the auction had bid $6 million for you, I don't care what I would have had to do, I would have come up with six million and one.
SUPMALE:You're my girl, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:You always will be.
SUPMALE:But if you want me to go, then that's what I'll do.
SUPMALE:You know, Pussycat/n I can't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:He's not coming back.
LEADFEMALE:You OK? Yeah, I think I'm OK.
OTHERMALE:No, no, I know I'm OK.
LEADMALE:You know, Ma, for the first time, I feel that it's over, that it's really over.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, forgive me, but I gotta speak.
SUPFEMALE:Sometimes it's harder to close the door than to open a window.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's very wise, Uncle Angelo.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Actually, I was talking about the apartment, but I'll take wise.
SUPMALE:
