LEADMALE:I'm coming to you, Sallie.
LEADFEMALE:Ma! Oh, God! Oh, God.
OTHERMALE:Oh, God! Hang on, Ma! Oh, please, please, hang on! All right, but you have to do me a favor.
LEADFEMALE:To the moon, Ma.
LEADMALE:If you wanted a favor, you could just ask.
SUPFEMALE:There are only two things I look forward to each day, and both of them involve yankin' a chain.
SUPMALE:Has anybody seen Blanche? She had a date last night, and this morning her bed's all made and she's not even there.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Here's our walking playground now.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, it must be true love.
LEADFEMALE:This guy is slowing down to 5 miles an hour.
LEADMALE:Mornin', everybody.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, what is going on? That guy's a little young, even for you.
LEADMALE:What are you talkin' about? He's a mature young man with his own business.
LEADMALE:Now, who wants to help me pick out five magazines? Blanche.
SUPMALE:Please.
OTHERMALE:I'm in no mood for ridicule.
LEADMALE:I've been going through a very tough time lately.
SUPFEMALE:We're concerned, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Jealous and concerned.
SUPFEMALE:You haven't drowned yourself in young men since this time last year, when you brought those twins home from the Jimmy Smits look-alike contest.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, Jorge and Esteban.
LEADMALE:Romantic, passionate and virtually interchangeable.
LEADMALE:Rose is right.
LEADFEMALE:Every year at this time you start robbing the cra- Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:By any chance, does somebody have a birthday coming up? All right, yes, damn it.
LEADFEMALE:It's almost my birthday.
SUPMALE:And I intend to forget all about it.
SUPMALE:And if you are indeed my friends, you will forget about it, too, and never bring the sordid subject up again.
SUPFEMALE:I know I'm gonna give her a party! You know, I actually feel sorry for Blanche Don't you, Ma? Who's Ma? Who are you? Just ask the damn favor.
LEADMALE:I need your help tonight for a charity.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, honey.
SUPMALE:I have a date.
LEADFEMALE:You call that a date? Thyroid Freddie? His eyes bug right out of his head.
SUPMALE:He looks like he's being choked.
LEADFEMALE:Now stop it.
LEADMALE:Freddie is a fine man.
LEADFEMALE:When he was younger, he could've been an astronaut, except for, well, you know, that eye thing.
LEADFEMALE:I've been working for this Meals on Wheels program, and I need a driver.
LEADMALE:Please? Oh, all right, Ma.
LEADMALE:I'll cancel Banjo Eyes.
SUPMALE:Don't worry.
OTHERMALE:There'll be other dates, Gloria.
LEADMALE:Ma, Gloria is my sister.
OTHERMALE:I'm Dorothy.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:There'll be other dates for Gloria.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I gotta agree with ya, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Ferguson.
SUPFEMALE:Bobby Vinton is the king of rock-'n'-roll.
LEADMALE:Ma, it's getting late.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you have to stay and visit with every one of them? Excuse me for trying to get more involved in their lives.
LEADMALE:That's fine, Ma, but did we really have to worm Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Jenkins' dog? Bup, bup, bup, bup.
LEADFEMALE:I always just leave this one outside the door.
LEADFEMALE:Really? It's been that way since I took over the route.
LEADMALE:OK.
LEADFEMALE:This is Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Taylor.
LEADMALE:You'll get along with her just fine.
LEADFEMALE:Two things One, compliment her cat, and two, Jews control the planet.

SUPFEMALE:Just be home before midnight, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, sir.
SUPMALE:Go away.
SUPFEMALE:Just a minute.
SUPMALE:You're not old, you're not ill.
SUPFEMALE:You're no slave to fashion.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you taking this food? Well, I'm hungry and I'm on the list.
LEADFEMALE:Who do you think you are? Sergeant Zbornak, Food Police.
LEADFEMALE:Now, look, I don't want any trouble.
OTHERMALE:Just hand over that turkey loaf.
LEADMALE:No, you can't.
OTHERFEMALE:I need this food.
LEADMALE:Except for the carrot-raisin salad.
LEADMALE:I've never understood carrot-raisin salad.
SUPFEMALE:No, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Taylor, it's Flintstone, not Flintstein.
SUPFEMALE:Lovely neighbors you got there, Mr? No, no, no.
LEADMALE:Get away! Go over there.
SUPMALE:Move! OK, OK.
LEADFEMALE:Take it easy.
LEADFEMALE:Who's the macadamia? So, uh, how you doin' today? Uh, look, I don't understand.
OTHERFEMALE:You're obviously not handicapped.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm just as disabled as anyone here.
LEADMALE:I find that very hard to believe.
LEADFEMALE:You don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:It's just too hard out there.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't been out of this apartment in 22 years.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I didn't know.
SUPFEMALE:Enjoy your dinner.
LEADFEMALE:How pathetic a person could live their life totally alone, devoid of companionship or love.
LEADFEMALE:I wish I could do something.
LEADMALE:Start a club.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, how'd things go tonight? I am so happy that I volunteered for Meals on Wheels, and I think I'm really making progress with Jimmy.
SUPFEMALE:Although I could make more if Ma would stop yelling "Boo!" You're really taking an interest in that man.
OTHERMALE:What happened to him, anyway? The turmoil of the '60s just got to him.
SUPFEMALE:The '60s were an emotional time for all of us.
SUPMALE:I can still see Big Daddy sitting on the porch swing, swilling down home brew, picking off peaceniks with his BB gun.
LEADMALE:Oh, God, I miss that man.
LEADMALE:Come on, honey.
LEADMALE:I'm sure Grand Dragon I mean, uh Big Daddy is always with you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:You know, I can see why your friend got disillusioned, but I don't see why he withdrew for 22 years.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I can.
LEADMALE:It happened to me.
LEADFEMALE:When Stanley walked out, I was so devastated, I locked myself in my bedroom.
LEADFEMALE:It was the one place that didn't remind me of Stan.
LEADFEMALE:And I just never wanted to come out.
OTHERMALE:Fortunately, someone was there to get me out of that room.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, Ma.
LEADMALE:Sure, Pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Sophia, this birthday thing kinda has me depressed as well.
LEADMALE:You think you could help me, too? Sure.
LEADMALE:No matter how bad things get, remember these sage words you're old, you sag, get over it.
LEADMALE:Sophia! So what if you knew Jesus personally? Wake up and smell the coffee, you fossil.
LEADFEMALE:My mistake.
LEADMALE:I thought since you looked like Yoda, you were also wise.
SUPFEMALE:Here it is.
SUPMALE:I needed to know when Blanche's real birthday was so I could throw her a party, so I got copies of her birth certificate, her DMV files Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Rose, that is an invasion of privacy.
OTHERMALE:What makes you think she wants a party? Everybody wants a party, no matter what they say.
LEADFEMALE:If you think we don't need to know Blanche's real age, maybe we should Open the damn envelope.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:After all these years, we're finally gonna know.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna know the true age of Blanche Devereaux.
LEADMALE:"Deleted by authority of the governor.
SUPMALE:" Oh, they These are all like that.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, you know what this means? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:She must have really jumped on this guy's bandwagon.
SUPMALE:You almost got it, Rose.
LEADFEMALE: Hello? Jimmy.
SUPFEMALE:It's me Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I'm fine, thanks.
SUPMALE:What's new with you? Oh, of course.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:That's wonderful.
SUPMALE:No, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right over.
LEADFEMALE:I have done it.
LEADFEMALE:A breakthrough.
SUPFEMALE:Jimmy is tired of isolating.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's great, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:I don't think I like this whole situation, Pussycat.
SUPMALE:Aw, come on, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:I'm helping.
LEADMALE:You're not a shrink.
LEADFEMALE:Be careful.
SUPFEMALE:Don't let your ego get involved.
LEADMALE:My ego is not involved.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I'm nobody special, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just an average citizen.
SUPFEMALE:I saw another citizen, and I reached out.
LEADFEMALE:A man changed his life, and I'm just somebody who helped him do it.
LEADMALE:Me, Dorothy Zbornak miracle worker.
LEADMALE:  Who is it? Jimmy, open the door.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I'm so glad you came.
LEADFEMALE:Of course I came.
SUPMALE:This is a big day for you.
LEADFEMALE:It is.
LEADMALE:I can't live like this anymore.
LEADMALE:Oh, I am so happy.
LEADMALE:I am, too.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, let's celebrate.
LEADFEMALE:Party time.
LEADFEMALE:The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind Jimmy.
LEADFEMALE:Look, why don't we just save this as sort of a treat for later on, hmm? 'Cause first there's something I want you to do.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to step out here, the way you do when you pick up your tray.
SUPMALE:OK.
LEADFEMALE:Now take another.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Now, how about one more? That wasn't so hard.
SUPMALE:How does it feel? So many years inside, I forgot how much I love to travel.
LEADFEMALE:You see, Jimmy, you put one foot in front of the other.
LEADFEMALE:That's all it takes.
LEADMALE:We're gonna get you out of here and to that counselor.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no.
LEADMALE:We're not going to any counselor.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you were tired of isolating.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I am.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, you're the first person I've trusted in years, and you're absolutely wonderful, and I want you to live with me.
OTHERMALE:Live here? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:All this can be yours.
LEADFEMALE:All this? Well, it does sweeten the pot, but Jimmy, I think you're missing the point.
SUPFEMALE:You can name six of the Chicago Seven.
SUPFEMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't say that.
LEADMALE:David Dellinger.
LEADFEMALE:Seven.
LEADFEMALE:Take me.
SUPMALE:Look, Jimmy, I like you, but not in that way.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:First person I reach out to in 22 years, and then you reject me.
SUPFEMALE:Jimmy No, no, forget it.
SUPMALE:Boy, you can't trust anybody.
SUPFEMALE:I thought this place wasn't gonna be my prison anymore.
LEADFEMALE:I thought for a second I remembered what "happy" was.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, thanks, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I'm never gonna leave this apartment again.
SUPFEMALE:"Miracle worker.
LEADFEMALE:" I'm an idiot.
LEADMALE:You have to stop beating yourself over the head with this.
SUPMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:You're not the one who made him drop out or the one who made him a recluse.
OTHERMALE:You're not the one who made him decide to live his life behind closed doors.
SUPMALE:You're just the one who made it stick.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe Jimmy'll come around.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I wish I could believe you, but, Rose, I have been there.
OTHERFEMALE:After a while you feel you're just in this gigantic black hole.
LEADFEMALE:We had a gigantic black hole back in St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf.
SUPMALE:Oh, God.
SUPMALE:On Main Street, right in front of the courthouse where Charlie and I got our marriage license and our permit to have kids.
LEADMALE:Oh, it was a lovely hole.
OTHERMALE:Everybody in town would stand around and look in it.
LEADMALE:And they say Hollywood is the entertainment capital of the world.
SUPMALE:Well, we didn't just look in it.
LEADMALE:Sometimes we'd point, too.
LEADMALE:Or spit and time it.
LEADMALE:Then there was always that wise guy who'd have a couple of drinks and unzip himself and It's official.
LEADFEMALE:I hate her.
LEADMALE:Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Ma, I just want to give him a call.
LEADFEMALE:Pussycat, you're out of your league.
LEADFEMALE:There are some people you just can't help.
LEADFEMALE:It's like the Good Lord said "You gotta know when to hold 'em.
OTHERFEMALE:Know when to fold 'em.
LEADMALE:Know when to walk away.
LEADFEMALE:" Ma, that's not the Good Lord, that's Kenny Rogers.
LEADMALE:God, Kenny Rogers.
SUPMALE:Tomato, tomah-to.
LEADFEMALE:The point is, there are others you can help.
LEADFEMALE:All those people on our route they depend on us.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Ma, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I must say that helping always makes me feel better.
OTHERFEMALE:You wanna come, Rose? Oh, no thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I have to figure out which of the traditional St.
LEADMALE:Olaf party games to play at Blanche's party.
LEADFEMALE: Party? Is that why you've been sneaking around trying to find out my age? A party? I forbid it! Blanche, a party is a celebration of life, and it's not just for you, but for your friends who love you.
LEADMALE:No! Stop being so vain.
OTHERFEMALE:You can't stay 42 forever.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, you can if you eat right, exercise regularly and live with women who look a lot older than you.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell me, Rose, is "Kill the Bitch" a traditional St.
LEADMALE:Olaf party game? I'm sorry, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Ferguson.
OTHERMALE:No, I didn't happen to see Ed Sullivan last night, but I'm sure it was a good one.
LEADFEMALE:She's ready, God.
OTHERMALE:That bell is you, Fluffy.
OTHERMALE:Jimmy Jim-- Jimmy, I just want to make sure that you're OK.
OTHERFEMALE:Do I have to play hardball? David Dellinger.
SUPFEMALE:Don't do this to me.
OTHERFEMALE:Bobby Seale.
LEADMALE:It's getting warm in here.
LEADFEMALE:Tom Hayden.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, God, you're good.
OTHERMALE:Abbie OK! Just come on in here, you.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want? I don't understand you.
OTHERFEMALE:I see a perfectly healthy, intelligent person living like this alone.
LEADMALE:I'm not alone.
LEADFEMALE:I've got my fish.
OTHERMALE:Fish don't reject you and fish don't judge you and fish You gotta feed fish.
LEADFEMALE:Jimmy, you deserve more.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, I thought I'd found it, but you dumped me.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I'll bet you've broken hundreds of hearts in your day, huh? Thousands? Well, yes, I have.
LEADMALE:I mean, wherever you go, I bet you torment and tease and tantalize every man you meet.
LEADFEMALE:You're right again.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Jimmy, we're getting away from the point.
OTHERFEMALE:You are missing the point.
LEADFEMALE:You are missing life.
LEADMALE:You are missing people.
LEADFEMALE:People who are happy, people who are in love, people who are towing my car away? I'd loan you my Auto Club card, but it's really expired.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you're right.
LEADMALE:Maybe I can't help.
SUPFEMALE:You need professional help.
LEADMALE:I hope someday you get it.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you think I wanna go with you? Dorothy, I look out that window, and I see the happy couples walking by, people walking into the supermarket.
LEADMALE:God, you want me to get on a bus and go see a counselor? I can't even shop for my own food.
LEADMALE:What I wouldn't give just to make my own dinner once.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, brunch is what I miss the most.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, Jimmy, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Let's take that extra step today and go to that supermarket.
SUPFEMALE:You won't be sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Jimmy, the world is filled with wonderful and exciting people.
LEADMALE:I'll take your suggestion, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Taylor.
SUPMALE:I'll play the Jackie Mason tapes at half speed, but I really don't think I'm gonna hear anything.
LEADMALE:I can't do it, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Jimmy, you've come this far.
LEADMALE:Do I have to? Jimmy, you're at a crossroads.
LEADFEMALE:The next step you take could be the most important one of your life.
LEADMALE:Now, look, you trust me.
OTHERFEMALE:Jimmy, make that step.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:Go.
LEADFEMALE: Congratulations! You're our one-millionth customer and winner of an all-expense paid trip to Mardi Gras!  Blanche, where have you been? I've been out walking.
SUPMALE:You know what today was? It was my birthday.
SUPMALE:Blanche Don't start your yammering.
LEADMALE:It was one of the best birthdays I have ever had.
LEADFEMALE:I did some soul-searching, and it occurred to me that I'm a vibrant energetic woman.
LEADFEMALE:I must still have some life left in me if I can make Mel Bushman's head snap back like that.
SUPFEMALE:You mean "Old Pez Head"? You know, Rose, you were right.
SUPMALE:What's in a number? Why, I still have my health, I have my challenging career at the museum.
SUPFEMALE:Most of all, I have you all my family.
LEADMALE:All that birthday nonsense was just an exercise in vanity.
SUPFEMALE:And so today, for the very first time, Blanche Devereaux is gonna reveal her true and accurate age.
LEADFEMALE:Right after you tell me your weight.
SUPFEMALE:Coffee? Please.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, now calm down.
SUPMALE:Oh, Ma, how can I? Dorothy, what's wrong? What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong.
SUPMALE:I single-handedly ruined a man's life today.
OTHERMALE:Which hand? This hand.
OTHERFEMALE:What difference does it make what hand? I ruined him.
LEADFEMALE: I was in over my head.
SUPFEMALE:I played with fire, and I lost.
LEADFEMALE:Jimmy.
LEADMALE:You forgot your sweater, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Come in.
OTHERMALE:How did you get here? I walked.
LEADMALE:Well, I'd like you to meet my roommates Rose and Blanche.
OTHERMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Would you like us to? No, no.
LEADMALE:I gotta start getting used to people.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, you should know that when I got back to my place, I did some thinking actually, I did some shaking and then I did some thinking and I realized I was alone again.
SUPMALE:After meeting you, I don't want to be alone anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:You're my friend, and if there's nice people like you out here, maybe the world's not such a bad place.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I know this isn't gonna be easy, but I want help.
OTHERMALE:Help and new clothes.
LEADFEMALE:So, I'll go to a counselor if you'll drive me.
LEADMALE:Drive you? Are you kidding? I'll listen to eight-tracks with you.
SUPFEMALE:'Course, we'll have to use Rose's car.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but whatever you want, Jimmy, I'm there for you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so glad this all worked out.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in here.
LEADMALE:I'll fix us some coffee.
SUPMALE:Great idea, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I think I can make it if I take it a little bit at a time.
OTHERMALE: Sure you can.
SUPMALE: Surprise! Ho! Ho! Ho! I'm gonna kill you! Rose, this is just a great party and the perfect gift.
LEADMALE:How'd you know what I needed? Oh, you.
LEADFEMALE:Come here.
SUPMALE:
