SUPMALE:Finally finally I'd like to thank our hostesses 
LEADMALE:Dorothy,
SUPMALE:Rose and Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:With people like them to support me, I am proud just to be running for city councilman.
SUPMALE:So good night, and remember my 
LEADFEMALE:"Gil Kessler for city councilman.
LEADFEMALE:"
LEADMALE:You call that a slogan?
LEADMALE:Excuse us.
LEADFEMALE:Easy on the arm, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:You break it, you pay for it.
SUPFEMALE:Ma.
SUPMALE:Ma, you promised you'd stay in your room until the meeting was over.
OTHERMALE:Who am I, Alf?
LEADFEMALE:I was hungry.
SUPFEMALE:You were spying.
OTHERMALE:So what? He's a wimp, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:For your information, Gil Kessler is a very bright man, an honest and devoted civic leader.
LEADMALE:And probably the biggest wimp I've ever known in my life.
LEADMALE:There's something else I don't like about him.
OTHERFEMALE:What?
SUPMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:It's a hunch.
LEADMALE:I can't put my finger on it.
OTHERFEMALE:But if I could, I would have to wash it.
LEADMALE:Ma, do me one favor.
SUPMALE:Stay here until we're finished.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you think your own mother would embarrass you.
OTHERMALE:It's not that, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:It's that, Ma.
SUPMALE:Well, I'd better skedaddle.
LEADFEMALE:You know, my wife is out of town.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to be up half the night trying to pick out a tie-sock-hankie combo.
SUPFEMALE:This is just the behind-the-scenes excitement I was hoping to be part of.
LEADMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, Gil.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
OTHERFEMALE:I think we ought to be proud.
SUPFEMALE:We threw one heck of a party.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't you guys just love being involved in politics? Oh, I haven't had this much fun since I worked on the Dewey campaign.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, you worked for Thomas Dewey? No, Melville Dewey.
LEADFEMALE:The founder of the Dewey Decimal System.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Gil Kessler doesn't stand a chance of winning.
LEADMALE:Who says?
LEADMALE:The Miami Post, the Miami Journal, the Miami tribune, and Miami's own, Sophia Petrillo.
LEADMALE:Ma, he's way behind in the polls, but the election is two days away and a lot can happen.
LEADFEMALE:I, for one, am gonna do everything in my power
SUPFEMALE:to get Gil elected.
SUPMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:You can start by taking this folder he left to his house.
LEADMALE:On the other hand, why should I deprive Rose of a chance to be of service.
LEADFEMALE:All right, but you'll have to wash these dishes.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, those dishes are dirty.
SUPMALE:Okay, I'll deliver the folder.
SUPFEMALE:I guess there's no sacrifice too great for a cause you really believe in.
LEADMALE:I just hope that big stupid jerk reimburses me for gas and mileage.
LEADMALE:There goes a great American.
LEADFEMALE:I woke you up, didn't I? And I better have a good reason.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I do.
LEADMALE:I got a great idea for Gil's campaign.
SUPMALE:I'm making bird feeders with his name on them to send around.
LEADFEMALE:And you think that's a dumb idea.
LEADFEMALE:You feel like taking this bird feeder away from me.
LEADFEMALE:And smashing it with this hammer.
OTHERMALE:Like this.
OTHERMALE:Holy smoke.
LEADMALE:Holy Toledo.
LEADFEMALE:Holy mackerel.
OTHERFEMALE:What, Ma?
LEADMALE:Nothing.
LEADMALE:What is it, Sophia? What, Rose? What? They caught Gil Kessler having an affair.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're kidding.
SUPMALE:With whom? They don't know her name.
OTHERMALE:But look.
SUPFEMALE:They hid in the bushes and took this picture of her from behind going into his house.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe it Wait a minute, that looks like Blanche's red dress.
LEADFEMALE:And those look like Blanche's red shoes.
LEADFEMALE:And aren't they her diamond earrings and gold bracelet? That little floozy stole Blanche's clothes.
SUPFEMALE:It's like having Agatha Christie right here in our kitchen.
LEADMALE:Rose, Blanche is that little floozy.
LEADMALE:You You mean
SUPMALE:She's at the 50.
LEADFEMALE:you think she
LEADFEMALE:The 40.
LEADMALE:The 30.
LEADMALE:Blanche, it's you! You're getting so good at that, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Now who's that over there? No, I mean right here.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:My backside is spread all across the front page.
LEADMALE:How could they do that? They probably used a wide-angle lens.
OTHERMALE:If I'd known I was being photographed, I would've turned around and smiled.
OTHERMALE:Listen, Blanche, ruining a man's career for a one night stand is hardly something to make light of.
LEADMALE:Oh, now, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:You girls don't believe this.
LEADMALE:I'm not denying that's me in the photograph, but I am denying that anything happened.
LEADMALE:I just dropped off his folder.
SUPMALE:Then why does it say here that you were in his house for two hours? We were just talking.
LEADFEMALE:Then why does it say, "The explosion was so great, it shattered windows in the building next door.
OTHERMALE:" Rose, that's an article about an earthquake in Guatemala.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, I dropped off the folder, talked for two hours, helped him pick out his tie-sock-hankie combo, and came home.
SUPMALE:Now, nothing else happened.
LEADMALE:I swear.
SUPMALE:Okay?
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Now, how are we gonna help him get out of this mess? I ought to call the newspaper.
LEADMALE:No, wait, wait.
SUPFEMALE:I think you should let Gil handle it himself.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, the paper says he's having a press conference this afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think you should do anything until then.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Fine, I'll wait.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this picture of Kessler, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:There's a secret behind those eyes.
OTHERFEMALE:Trust my hunch on this one.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Remember your hunch about your nephew, Angelo?
LEADMALE:You said one day he'd be Pope.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, you gotta pay attention.
OTHERFEMALE:I said one day, he'd sell dope.
LEADMALE:What do you think he went to Attica for, the volleyball program? Bruno Bonofiglio.
OTHERMALE:Ma! I was asleep! So was I.
LEADMALE:That's when it came to me.
SUPFEMALE:Picture this.
LEADFEMALE:Sicily, 1922.
LEADFEMALE:The village is in a terrible wine crisis.
OTHERMALE:It's the peak of the wine season.
LEADMALE:All our grape stompers are ravaged by an outbreak of athlete's foot.
LEADMALE:Soon the Chianti has a green hue and tastes like Desenex.
LEADMALE:They call in Sicily's foremost podiatrist, Bruno Bonofiglio.
LEADMALE:He's the one who prescribed arch supports for Mussolini.
LEADMALE:Must have really helped his lower back when they hung him by his heels.
LEADMALE:Forget him.
LEADMALE:I'm talking about Bruno Bonofiglio.
LEADFEMALE:I take one look at him, and I have a hunch he's trouble.
LEADFEMALE:But nobody believes me.
LEADFEMALE:So, what happens? He cures everybody and wine sales skyrocket.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Unless I'm missing something, your hunch was wrong.
LEADMALE:My hunches are never wrong.
OTHERMALE:Now, everyone is living high on the hog and eating rich foods.
LEADMALE:The next thing you know, there's a gout epidemic.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody can stomp grapes.
LEADMALE:And Bruno makes a killing selling orthopedic sandals.
OTHERMALE:Don't tell me.
OTHERFEMALE:He went to America, and changed his name to Dr.
LEADMALE:Scholl.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Actually, he developed a foot fetish and suffocated when he shoved his head in a lady's rubber boot.
SUPMALE:Ma, don't ever wake me up again.
LEADMALE:Quick.
LEADMALE:Turn on the television.
SUPMALE:Gil's press conference is about to start.
LEADMALE:Gosh, I'm nervous.
LEADFEMALE:I hope they're not too hard on him.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't be too sure.
SUPFEMALE:Look at all those reporters.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, there's Charlie Thompson.
SUPMALE:And Fred Leone, and Mike Devlin.
LEADMALE: Does he plan to withdraw from the race? I had lunch at the press club once.
LEADFEMALE:Only once? Gosh, it took me two years to learn everybody's name on Eight is Enough.
LEADFEMALE:Hush, hush, he's about to start.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we're about to find out.
LEADMALE:Here comes the candidate and his campaign manager now.
SUPMALE:Good afternoon.
LEADMALE:I'm here to respond to the media speculation that I am having an affair with an unidentified woman.
LEADFEMALE: I have been the subject of many scurrilous, slanderous and downright malicious rumors in my career.
SUPMALE:But this rumor is the worst kind of rumor.
SUPMALE:This is a true rumor.
OTHERFEMALE:It actually happened Just like you said.
LEADMALE:Well, not with me, it didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Kessler, who was the woman? I can't reveal her identity under any circumstances.
LEADFEMALE: Independent sources identified her as Blanche Devereaux.
LEADMALE:Oh, please.
OTHERFEMALE:What sources? Sorry, Blanche.
SUPMALE:I don't believe this.
OTHERFEMALE:He just lied.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, he Rose? Well, don't you girls believe me? Sophia? I believe you, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Absolutely.
LEADMALE:Hello? I need a number for People magazine.
LEADFEMALE:The department that buys stories about politicians who sleep with sleazy broads.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, it's not about you.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, Rose? Talk to me.
LEADMALE:You girls have got to believe me.
SUPMALE:We believed you once, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:We're not falling for it again.
OTHERMALE:Falling for what? I told you the truth.
LEADFEMALE:Come off it.
SUPMALE:You really expect us to believe that Gil was lying on television in front of a million people? People lie on television, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:They do it on 60 Minutes all the time.
SUPMALE:He's a married man running for election.
LEADMALE:Why would he say he had an affair if he hadn't? I'm sure I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:And I also don't know why you just assume I'm guilty.
LEADFEMALE:Can you give me one good reason why I would lie to you? You're embarrassed because you seduced him.
OTHERMALE:You're scared and guilty because you've ruined his campaign.
LEADFEMALE:Three good reasons.
LEADMALE:Oh, shut up, Rose.
LEADMALE:Oh, shut up, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, this is Blanche Devereaux.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, that Blanche Devereaux.
LEADFEMALE:And no, I did not.
OTHERFEMALE:Absolutely not.
LEADMALE:I will tell it to a judge, I will yell it from the highest mountain, I will swear to it on a stack of Bibles.
LEADMALE:Now, did that sound like a liar? No.
OTHERMALE:It sounded like Jim and Tammy Faye on Nightline.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? Yes, this is Blanche, and how did you get this number? Better yet, why am I even talking to you? I don't like you.
LEADFEMALE:Matter of fact, I hate you.
LEADFEMALE:You can just tear up my number and go climb back under your slimy rock with all the rest of your slimy friends.
LEADFEMALE:And don't you ever call here again.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, call Stan.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, why don't you admit what you did.
OTHERFEMALE:You made a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:You live your life a certain way and now you're paying for it.
SUPMALE:You are assuming that I'm guilty because of my past.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that is not fair.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, girls, I'm in trouble here.
SUPFEMALE:Now, this isn't funny anymore.
LEADMALE:You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:This is not funny.
SUPFEMALE:It is sad.
SUPMALE:You couldn't come to us and tell us the truth.
LEADMALE:And you still can't.
LEADMALE:Don't do this to me.
SUPFEMALE:You're my two best friends.
SUPMALE:How do we know you're telling the truth about that? Well, I guess you don't.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me, Miss.
SUPMALE:You can't go in there.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, the hell I can't.
LEADFEMALE:I ought to kick your butt to Tallahassee.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:You're sor Do you have reporters badgering you? Do you have roommates calling you a liar? You are the damn liar.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't sleep with you if you were the last man in Creation.
LEADFEMALE:Now, why did you lie?
OTHERFEMALE:Well, the reason is
LEADMALE:Why? I was trying
LEADMALE:Why? Nobody ever listens to me.
LEADMALE:Quit whining, you wimp, and tell me why you lied.
LEADMALE:That is the reason.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody ever listens to me.
LEADMALE:They never have.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a wimp, just like you said.
OTHERFEMALE:At least I was until today.
LEADFEMALE:When the newspaper printed that story about my having an affair, people stopped thinking I was a wimp and started listening.
OTHERFEMALE:I couldn't tell them it was a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:Are you trying to tell me that people like you better now because they think you went to bed with a gorgeous woman? Here, see for yourself.
OTHERMALE:This is today's poll.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I never expected that they would figure out it was you in that picture.
LEADMALE:I felt terrible when they did.
SUPMALE:Well, how do you think I feel? People think I slept with you.
LEADMALE:Blanche all my life, people have looked right past me.
SUPMALE:You know, when I was growing up, the first day back at school every year, half the other kids always thought I was new in town.
LEADFEMALE:I had to bring in a yearbook to prove that they were wrong.
OTHERMALE:But all the same, I always felt that deep inside me was a great man trying to get out.
LEADFEMALE:So I went into politics.
OTHERMALE:And people kept looking right past that great man.
LEADFEMALE:Until today.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, as crazy as it sounds, I've got a real chance to win.
LEADMALE:Because you lied.
LEADFEMALE:Is that such a high price? Oh, Gil, I don't know much about politics, but I do know a thing or two about men.
LEADFEMALE:And I know what kind of man you are.
LEADMALE:You're an honest man.
SUPFEMALE:That's why we all believed in you.
LEADMALE:Now you started lying and you're just like other politicians.
LEADFEMALE:Dishonest.
LEADFEMALE:If you even win this election, it won't mean a hill of beans.
LEADMALE:'Cause it won't be you winning.
LEADFEMALE:You'll never be a great man, without being an honest man.
LEADMALE:You think about that.
LEADMALE:This is exciting.
SUPFEMALE:Just think, in less than 24 hours, Gil Kessler could be city councilman.
SUPMALE:I'd love to get excited, Rose, but no matter what happens, I'm gonna get stuck cleaning out that peeing-angel punch bowl.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I've been chatting with your boy, Kessler.
LEADMALE:Give me another hour, I'll have his secret figured out.
SUPMALE:What secret? You got cheese in your ears? I said give me another hour.
OTHERFEMALE:Get away from me, you bloodhounds.
OTHERMALE:I have nothing to say to you.
LEADMALE:Except 
SUPMALE:From now on, when my name appears in print, it better read Blanche Devereaux, comma, 39.
SUPMALE:Well, she has a lot of nerve showing up here tonight.
LEADMALE:Let's try to be polite, Rose.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Hi, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Blanche, I said hello.
SUPFEMALE:I don't normally speak to people who call me a liar.
SUPFEMALE:Now look, Blanche, we're in public now.
LEADMALE:There's no reason to be hostile.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yes, there is.
LEADMALE:I don't like you.
LEADFEMALE:And horizontal stripes make you look like Roger Ebert.
SUPMALE:Do you really want to put this on a level of name calling?
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:So do I.
OTHERMALE:Traitor.
LEADFEMALE:Back stabber.
LEADFEMALE:Tramp.
SUPMALE:Home wrecker.
SUPFEMALE:Indian giver.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, I just got caught up in the moment.
LEADMALE:Ladies and gentlemen.
LEADFEMALE:If I could have your attention, I have a few words I'd like to say.
OTHERMALE:First off, I want to thank all of you.
LEADMALE:This has been a great campaign.
LEADFEMALE:Tomorrow at this time, I could actually be your councilman.
SUPFEMALE:But I don't want to be your city councilman unless I can win this job honestly, and there is something that I have not been honest about.
LEADMALE:Blanche Devereaux and I never had an affair.
LEADFEMALE:I only said that to improve my image.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche is too good a person to be used that way.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, she made me realize how important honesty is.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I'm going to be honest about something else.
LEADMALE:I'm not who you think I am.
SUPMALE:In 1968, I had an operation.
LEADMALE:Until that time, I lived life as part-time stenographer and mild-mannered housewife, Anna-Maria Bonnaduci.
LEADFEMALE:What? I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:What do you say about my hunches now, Dorothy? Five more minutes, I would have had it.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, how could you know? No one knew.
SUPMALE:Please, look at his nose, of course he's Italian.
OTHERMALE:I'm still confused about the operation Gil Kessler had.
SUPFEMALE:Is the man asleep during it? I think so, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:And what about the parts they put on? Do they test them first? Of course, Rose, you know, like windshield wipers.
SUPFEMALE:So they work.
OTHERFEMALE:I assume so, yes.
SUPMALE:What are they made of? Silly putty, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I don't know, Rose.
LEADMALE:I just want to forget the whole incident.
LEADFEMALE:It's been a terrible night and I am very upset.
SUPMALE:Because Gil dropped out of the election and Blanche hates us.
OTHERMALE:I'm upset because they haven't re-run the Facts of Life Goes to Australia.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't be surprised if Blanche never speaks to us again.
SUPMALE:She'd certainly have every reason not to.
LEADFEMALE:We did a terrible thing, not believing her.
SUPFEMALE:We might as well get used to the fact that she's gonna be mad at us for a long, long time.
SUPMALE:Hi, girls.
OTHERMALE:How ya'll doing? Why, Blanche, aren't you mad? Not anymore.
LEADMALE:But we did a terrible thing.
LEADFEMALE:You should stay mad at us for a long, long time.
LEADFEMALE:You should make us grovel, eat dirt, beg for forgiveness, give us the silent treatment.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, if you give us the silent treatment, I will eat dirt.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't stay mad at you girls, you know? I did some thinking and I realized I was as much to blame for all this as you all were.
LEADFEMALE:How?
OTHERFEMALE:By talking so much.
LEADFEMALE:As you know, I've always talked a lot about my men.
SUPFEMALE:And sometimes I've stretched the truth just a little.
LEADFEMALE:It's an old Southern tradition, storytelling.
LEADMALE:Just because you didn't have a good time there's no reason to bore your friends with a dull story.
LEADFEMALE:So you embellish it, you add a little shading, a little color, a little hot tub.
SUPFEMALE:I guess it finally caught up with me.
LEADFEMALE:But I do think I've learned my lesson.
LEADMALE:Can we have a hug and forget this ever happened? You bet we can.
LEADFEMALE:Come here, you two.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm glad we're friends again.
OTHERMALE:Oh, me too.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, Blanche, now that we have you telling the truth, um Would you tell us the truth about, um, Bob Fredericks.
LEADFEMALE:True, absolutely true.
SUPFEMALE:How about Howard Asher? True.
LEADMALE:Eric Murdock.
SUPMALE:True, true.
OTHERMALE:He had a twin brother.
LEADFEMALE:Would I lie to my two best friends? 
OTHERFEMALE:
