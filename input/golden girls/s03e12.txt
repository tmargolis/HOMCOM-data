SUPFEMALE:Ma, if you didn't like the dress, you should have just told me.
LEADMALE:I was trying to be helpful.
SUPMALE:Asking if it came with a sign saying "Wide Load" is not being helpful.
LEADFEMALE:I will never ever take you shopping with me again.
SUPMALE:Fine, I'll shop at the mall by myself.
LEADMALE:Then I'll be able to pee when I'm good and ready.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, you found the dress for the banquet.
LEADMALE:Oh, do you just adore it? Does it stir emotions deep within you? Could you just throw yourself down and die for it? It's a dress, Blanche, it's not the Alamo.
OTHERMALE:It must be pretty special.
LEADMALE:It took you five weeks to find it.
LEADFEMALE:That's because I'm hard to fit.
LEADFEMALE:I can see that, Dorothy, I'm not blind.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't mean anything by that, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Actually, I tend to fall between sizes myself.
LEADMALE:Usually, I'm smack dab between a four And a 16.
LEADMALE:Hi, girls.
LEADFEMALE: Hi, Rose.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dorothy, is that your dress for the museum fundraiser?
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Well, let's see it.
LEADMALE:Oh, all right, but I warn you, it is very simple.
SUPMALE:Well, what do you think? I think you're my best friend, so let's change the subject.
LEADMALE:I think it's beautiful.
LEADMALE:Exactly what I would have picked.
SUPMALE:That settles it.
SUPFEMALE:It goes back tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:What are you wearing, Blanche? I'll probably grab some dazzling little number from my closet, that these people have not been privileged to see.
OTHERMALE:Maybe the red, sequined, strapless, backless, low-cut mini.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you just tie a scarf around your waist?  Oh, Ma, good news.
SUPFEMALE:They changed the flavor of Haley's MO.
LEADFEMALE:I'm taking the dress back.
LEADFEMALE:So? So I'm sorry I lost my temper before.
OTHERMALE:And Ma, I really would like you to go with me and help me pick out a dress.
SUPFEMALE:What do you say? What do I say? I'm your mother, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I was there for you when you needed a communion dress.
LEADFEMALE:I was there when you needed a prom dress.
LEADMALE: I was there when you needed a wedding dress.
LEADMALE:And frankly, I'm sick of it.
OTHERMALE:Buy your own damn dress.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be over at Mildred's.
SUPFEMALE:Rose Nylund? No, if I start acting like her, pull the plug.
SUPMALE:Rose Nylund.
LEADFEMALE:Forty-three years and I'd know you anywhere.
SUPMALE:Are you You're not Could you Buddy Rourke.
LEADFEMALE:Buddy Rourke!
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, Dorothy, it's Buddy Rourke.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on in.
SUPFEMALE:Buddy, these are my two best friends, Dorothy and Blanche.
LEADMALE:How do you do?
OTHERMALE:Hi, there.
SUPMALE:Buddy Rourke, after all these years.
LEADMALE:You don't know who he is, do you, Rose? Haven't a clue.
LEADFEMALE:Please, don't be embarrassed.
OTHERMALE:We never met before.
LEADFEMALE:Then how exactly would you have known her anywhere? Charlie never stopped talking about her.
OTHERMALE:You knew Charlie?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, sit down.
LEADFEMALE:I served with your husband in the war.
SUPFEMALE:Fort Bragg to Nottingham to Normandy and back, thank the Lord.
SUPFEMALE:Charlie Nylund was one of the finest men I ever met.
OTHERFEMALE: I often wonder why he put up with a wise guy like me, from the backstreets of Boston.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry I didn't know who you were, but Charlie didn't talk about the war.
LEADMALE:I always hoped Charlie and I would hook up again one day.
SUPFEMALE:But, uh, well, believe it or not, I never had the occasion to visit St.
SUPFEMALE:Olaf.
SUPFEMALE:Really? You mean, not even to change planes for St.
LEADMALE:Gustav? Oh, you can't get to St.
LEADMALE:Gustav by plane, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:You have to go by toboggan.
LEADFEMALE:Course, traveling in the summer is really rough on the old heinie.
SUPFEMALE:It's a great way to rack up lots of frequent tobogganer mileage.
SUPFEMALE:This is just amazing.
OTHERMALE:How did you ever find Rose after all this time? I got Rose's address from Charlie's army pension records.
LEADMALE:And I realized a lifetime had passed and I never laid eyes on my old chum's favorite girl.
LEADFEMALE:So, I made myself a promise.
SUPFEMALE:If I was ever in the area,
LEADMALE:I'd pay my respects.
SUPMALE:Would you stay for dinner? I'm making sweet and sour smelt kabobs.
OTHERFEMALE:Smelt kabobs.
OTHERMALE:Oh, darn, I had them for lunch.
LEADMALE:Me too.
SUPFEMALE:They served them on the plane.
SUPMALE:And I'm awfully tired after the trip, but I was hoping that, uh, you might let me invite you to lunch tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:That is, if you're free.
SUPMALE:Oh, that'd be wonderful.
LEADMALE:And if you have time, I'd like to show you around Miami.
SUPMALE:I'll pick you up around noon.
SUPMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Ladies, it's been a pleasure meeting you.
LEADMALE:Nice meeting you.
SUPFEMALE:Likewise.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, you're every bit as lovely as the picture Charlie used to carry.
LEADMALE: See you tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:What a sweet man.
SUPFEMALE:Absolutely charming.
LEADMALE:And he obviously idolized your Charlie.
SUPMALE:And more importantly, he wasn't wearing a wedding ring.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, don't be silly.
OTHERFEMALE:I merely checked it out and I noticed him giving me the eye.
SUPMALE:Blanche, have you ever met a man you didn't think was giving you the eye? Once, in 1976.
LEADMALE:But it was only two days later that Mr.
LEADFEMALE:President Jimmy Carter announced to the American people he had secretly lusted in his heart.
SUPMALE: You can't be serious.
LEADMALE:Charlie read you every one of my letters? Selected passages.
LEADMALE:He selfishly kept the more intimate sections to himself.
LEADMALE:One, please.
LEADMALE:I used to write him every Sunday, after church.
SUPMALE:That way I'd have all the latest gossip around town.
LEADFEMALE:No, he read me the gossip.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, and I remember there was some kind of a scandal.
SUPMALE:Uh, with a neighbor, I think.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, the name was, uh, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:Phineas Wigley? I can't believe you remember that.
LEADMALE:Well, in all fairness, Phineas Wigley is a hard name to forget.
LEADMALE:Oh, I know what you mean.
LEADFEMALE:The Wigleys were a revered family.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, until the scandal.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it was just terrible.
SUPFEMALE:The Navy came to town to take bids for a big submarine contract.
SUPMALE: They said they wanted three submarines built for a million.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Finneas said he could make 100 for half the money.
SUPMALE:So, of course, he got the contract.
LEADFEMALE: When the Navy came to check on the progress, six months later, they discovered there'd been a misunderstanding.
LEADFEMALE:Finneas had made 100 hoagie heroes for $500,000.
LEADFEMALE:He claimed the reason they were so expensive was he used all imported meats and cheeses.
LEADMALE:You know, that story still tickles me.
SUPFEMALE:Just as much as the first time Charlie told it to me.
SUPMALE:It just amazes me, how much you know about my life with Charlie.
OTHERMALE:Rose I don't think you realize how very much you meant to him.
OTHERMALE:Or how very much you meant to me.
SUPFEMALE:To you? I don't understand.
LEADMALE:I didn't have a wife or a sweetheart back home.
LEADMALE:And when Charlie would read me your letters, I felt like Well, that someone cared.
LEADMALE:And that meant a lot to me.
SUPMALE: I spent a long time searching for someone exactly like Rose Nylund.
SUPMALE:I never found her.
SUPFEMALE:And now I know why.
SUPFEMALE:There's no one exactly like Rose Nylund.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Buddy.
LEADFEMALE:Charlie carried those letters in his jacket through the war.
SUPMALE:I carried them in my heart for a lifetime.
LEADMALE:And I think I fell in love with the woman who wrote them.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, you gonna show me the dress or not?
SUPFEMALE: Be right there.
OTHERFEMALE:Get a move on.
SUPMALE:If you hurry up, I can give you an honest unbiased opinion.
LEADMALE:You'll still have time to return it before the mall closes tonight.
OTHERMALE:Well, Ma, what do you think?
OTHERMALE:Pussycat,
LEADMALE:you look sensational.
OTHERMALE:You really think so, Ma? I really think so.
OTHERMALE:I've never seen you look so beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Who's the designer? He deserves a Nobel Prize for miracles.
LEADFEMALE:Why do I even ask you? I'm your mother, I'm gonna tell you whether you ask me or not.
SUPMALE:By the way, the sleeves are too long.
LEADMALE:I'll ask Rose to shorten them.
LEADFEMALE:If you can find her.
SUPMALE:Ever since that guy hit town, she spends most of her time polishing his shillaly.
OTHERMALE:Ma, Rose and Buddy are just friends.
SUPMALE:Sure, and Michael Jackson was born with that cleft in his chin.
LEADMALE: Girls! Just wait until you see the little number I picked up for the museum banquet.
OTHERFEMALE:Here I come!
OTHERMALE:I don't believe it.
LEADMALE: It can't be.
SUPFEMALE:Don't panic.
LEADMALE:Pick up one for Rose, you can go as the Pointer Sisters.
SUPFEMALE:You were going to wear something out of your closet.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I was.
LEADFEMALE:But as it turned out, nothing fit me.
SUPMALE:What did you expect, Blanche? Last weekend, you ate so many pudding pops, you could have built the Eiffel Tower from the sticks.
LEADMALE:That is not what I meant.
LEADFEMALE:I meant everything just hangs on me.
SUPFEMALE:Of course.
SUPFEMALE:That's why you have to cover it with a dress.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Dorothy, what are we gonna do about this? We are not going to do anything.
LEADMALE:Blanche, it has taken me a whole month to find this dress, you are simply going to have to take yours back.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, be reasonable.
SUPFEMALE:This dress looks so much better on me than it does on you.
LEADMALE:Hi, girls.
OTHERMALE:I love your dress.
LEADMALE:I am not taking mine back.
OTHERMALE:I am not taking mine back.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, I really need to talk to you.
OTHERMALE:This is crazy.
LEADMALE:Since when do you care how you look? I think it started when I came down from the bell tower and had my hump fixed.
LEADFEMALE:Buddy's going back to Boston on Saturday.
SUPMALE:This dress looks sensational on me.
SUPFEMALE:People expect to see me in a sensational dress.
LEADFEMALE:What do they expect to see me in, a yarmulke and a Hefty bag? He wants me to go with him.
LEADFEMALE:To live with him.
LEADFEMALE:And I think I might.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, honey, you can't be serious.
LEADMALE: Why not?
LEADMALE:You hardly know the man.
LEADFEMALE:I feel like I've known him all my life.
SUPMALE:I talk to him about Charlie, I talk to him about St.
LEADMALE:Olaf, I talk to him about my family, my animal friends, I talk to him about life on the farm If that man didn't get a medal in the war, he deserves one now.
OTHERMALE: Wait a minute! Did she just say "live with him"? That's right, Sophia.
SUPMALE:Not marry him, live with him.
SUPFEMALE: Yes.
SUPMALE:Two World Wars, a Polish pope and now this.
OTHERFEMALE:I may live to see CBS come up with a morning show yet.
OTHERFEMALE:I just don't know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:Well, frankly, Rose, I think you're just rushing things.
LEADMALE:But, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it's better to live with Buddy than to just charge full steam ahead and marry him.
LEADFEMALE:No, it isn't.
LEADFEMALE:This is morally wrong.
LEADMALE:It is epically offensive.
LEADMALE:It's an out and out sin.
LEADFEMALE:Why do I feel like I just fell through the looking glass? Blanche, how can you, of all people, say something like that? Well, Rose Nylund, I have never lived with a man without the benefit of marriage.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me, Blanche, I think what you mean is you have never lived with a man without benefit of room service.
OTHERMALE:Being with a man is not the same thing as living with a man.
LEADFEMALE:You're right, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Living with a man eliminates the need for an overnight bag and a stop at the drugstore.
OTHERMALE:And the need for marriage.
OTHERFEMALE:Family and tradition.
LEADMALE:Not to mention wedding showers, catered affairs, the bridal registry at Burdines.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I know what you mean, Blanche, but there's another side to this.
LEADMALE:If I had lived with Stan before we got married I could have spared us both some very painful times.
LEADMALE:And a bitter divorce.
SUPMALE:And possibly given birth to reasonably attractive children.
LEADFEMALE:It does seem like the right thing to do.
LEADFEMALE:I'm comfortable with Buddy.
LEADMALE:Everything seems so natural.
SUPFEMALE:It's easier being with him because he already knows
LEADMALE:so much about me.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but Rose,
SUPFEMALE:do you love him?
LEADFEMALE:I think so.
OTHERFEMALE:What about money?
SUPFEMALE:Everyone loves money.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I mean, have you talked about financial arrangements? If you were married, you could have a prenuptial agreement.
LEADMALE:But just living together, all you can do is steal money out of his wallet while he's in the shower.
SUPFEMALE:We've agreed to keep our finances separate.
SUPMALE:He insisted on it.
LEADFEMALE:That's good, at least.
LEADFEMALE:He suggested that since we'll need a bigger place to live, I should give him my half of the money now before I get there.
LEADFEMALE:So that it'll be our place, not his, right from the start.
LEADMALE:Sounds like you've made up your mind.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I have.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, but I feel awful about leaving you guys.
SUPMALE:I feel like I'm breaking up the Three Musketeers.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you go with your heart.
SUPMALE:We just want you to be happy.
LEADFEMALE:I am happy.
LEADFEMALE:And I want you to be happy.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I want you to settle this dress business.
SUPMALE:Oh! There is nothing to settle.
LEADMALE:Now, I am wearing this dress.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy! It deserves to be displayed on a devastatingly beautiful body.
OTHERMALE:Who are you gonna send it to, Kim Basinger? What is that supposed to mean? Why don't you think about it while inhaling your next cheese cake.
LEADFEMALE:How dare she imply that I overeat.
LEADFEMALE:Makes me so mad! Oh, darn.
LEADMALE:We're out of Chips Ahoy.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna get out of this girdle and go down to the market for some cookies and bean dip.
SUPMALE:Oh, hell, I'll just take the damn thing off in the car.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, I'm glad you're here.
LEADFEMALE:I have something to tell you.
LEADMALE:What are you holding?
LEADFEMALE:A new gown.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no! I wanted to be the nice one.
LEADFEMALE:I bought a new dress too.
LEADMALE: Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Marty's? On Market Street? Where every dress is a guaranteed one of a kind original? If we have the same dress, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Marty's gonna be left with one of a kind.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank goodness! Everything's all right.
LEADMALE:Except for what I have to tell you.
SUPFEMALE:It wasn't about the dress? It was about Rose and Buddy.
SUPMALE:That business of giving him money has been bothering me.
OTHERFEMALE:So I've decided to do some checking on Buddy Rourke.
LEADFEMALE:And after a couple of phone calls I found out he had just retired after 45 years in the records department of the Army Pension Office.
SUPMALE:I don't get it.
LEADMALE:That's how he knew about Charlie.
LEADFEMALE:They never served together.
LEADFEMALE:He just read his file.
LEADMALE:But he knew all those things about Rose.
LEADMALE:He knew that she came from St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, everything else, Rose probably volunteered.
LEADMALE:You know her, a stranger says hello, and suddenly he's hearing the life story of Uncle Fingerbinger and his 30-pound rutabaga.
SUPMALE:Then this is all just a scam to bilk Rose out of some money? Absolutely, and it is not the first time he's tried it.
LEADFEMALE:Where is Rose? I mean, we have to tell her.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, she said she had to go to the bank and then go to meet Buddy.
OTHERMALE:What are we gonna do? There's nothing we can do.
SUPMALE:Wait until she gets home.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good Lord.
OTHERFEMALE: Hey, girls.
LEADMALE:How do you like this spiffy little number I picked up? Sophia, that's the same dress I got.
SUPMALE:Well, now you know how it should look.
SUPMALE: I wrote the kids about you.
LEADFEMALE: Really?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, not about us.
LEADMALE:About you.
SUPFEMALE:About how you knew their father.
OTHERFEMALE:They found it unbelievable.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean? Well, that you and I finally met.
LEADMALE:Oh, I thought you meant they wouldn't believe there were any dinosaurs still around
LEADMALE:from World War II.
LEADFEMALE:Speaking of dinosaurs, did Charlie ever tell you about how they found the dinosaur bones right outside St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf?
OTHERFEMALE:Rose
LEADFEMALE:Karl Nickerson was teaching his German shepherd to bury a herring bone.
OTHERFEMALE:Karl was
LEADMALE:Rose! You haven't even mentioned about moving to Boston.
LEADMALE:Are you avoiding the subject?
LEADFEMALE:I can't go with you, Buddy.
SUPMALE:But, Rose It wouldn't be fair.
LEADFEMALE:I've given it a lot of thought and I realize, I'm not being honest with you.
OTHERMALE:Or with myself.
LEADMALE:Rose, how could this be?
LEADMALE:We've been so happy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I am happy.
OTHERMALE:Happy with the memories of Charlie that you rekindled.
LEADMALE:Oh! Sometimes I put those memories too far away because I'm afraid they'll be painful.
LEADFEMALE:It's the hardest on holidays or when I'm lying in bed, alone at night.
LEADFEMALE:But remembering Charlie with you is wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad I met you, Buddy.
LEADMALE:But I don't love you.
SUPMALE: I I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, I went to the bank and I got something for you.
LEADFEMALE:It's a gold watch.
SUPFEMALE:It's Charlie's gold watch.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to have it.
SUPMALE:But this is a very expensive piece of jewelry.
LEADFEMALE:Please, Buddy.
OTHERFEMALE:I think I've taken enough from you and Charlie already.
OTHERMALE:What?
LEADMALE:Listen, I hate emotional scenes.
LEADMALE:I'm the only Irishman in Boston who avoids wakes and political rallies.
OTHERMALE:So, I'm just gonna run, you understand?
SUPFEMALE:But Buddy
LEADFEMALE:I'll write.
OTHERFEMALE:I will.
LEADFEMALE:No, I won't.
LEADFEMALE:I always say that.
LEADMALE:I never do.
SUPMALE:You take care of yourself, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:You're a special lady.
LEADFEMALE:  Ma?
OTHERMALE:Ma, I need to talk to someone.
SUPFEMALE:Sure, come in.
LEADFEMALE:I can hear Pavarotti live from the Met anytime.
OTHERFEMALE: What's the problem? Ma, I'm upset about Rose.
LEADMALE:Me too.
SUPMALE:I thought I was finally gonna get a room with some sunlight.
LEADMALE:I'm upset because we haven't told her the truth about Buddy.
OTHERMALE:Everything turned out all right.
SUPMALE:She gave him the brush off, she didn't give him any money,
OTHERFEMALE:he didn't even take the watch.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:But we're letting her live with a lie.
SUPFEMALE:So, a little lie gave her a lot of pleasure.
SUPMALE:What harm does that do?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Then what's the problem?
LEADFEMALE:It doesn't seem right.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, let me tell you a story.
SUPFEMALE:Picture it.
LEADFEMALE:Sicily, 1922.
LEADFEMALE:A young military officer stationed far from home.
LEADFEMALE:He wanders the streets seeking a friendly face and a glass of Chianti.
SUPMALE:Finally, he happens into a dusty little cafe where he finds both.
SUPMALE:The man laughs for the first time in months.
OTHERFEMALE:And finds inspiration in a beautiful peasant girl, wise beyond her years.
OTHERMALE:When the cafe is closed, she takes him home with her.
SUPFEMALE:Three glorious days, they make love and drink wine.
LEADFEMALE:He returns to his command prepared to lead his people through whatever battles need to be fought.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, that young peasant girl was me.
LEADFEMALE:And that young man was Winston Churchill.
LEADMALE:Ma, you made that whole thing up, now what is your point? That I made it up.
LEADFEMALE:It was a little lie that gave me a lot of pleasure.
LEADMALE:If Rose is happy, and there was no harm done, let her have that.
SUPMALE:You know something, Ma You may be right.
LEADFEMALE: Good night, Charlie.
SUPFEMALE:I love you.
OTHERFEMALE:
