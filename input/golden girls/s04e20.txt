SUPFEMALE:I didn't know you were good at making malts.
SUPFEMALE:Good? I'm an expert.
OTHERFEMALE:Didn't I tell you I worked in a malt shop when I was in high school? Soda jerk? No, thanks.
LEADMALE:I'll have a malted.
LEADMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADMALE:Aren't you gonna have one, Dorothy? Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:After you've worked in a malt shop, the greatest pleasure you can get is slurping up what's left in the blender.
LEADMALE: Yum.
SUPMALE: Is it any wonder I never breast-fed her? What are you doing out? I thought you were in your room.
SUPFEMALE:I whittled a gun out of a bar of soap and overpowered the guards.
SUPFEMALE:I went to the mini-mall.
LEADMALE:They opened a Little Slice of Sicily pizzeria.
LEADFEMALE:So I walk in, and this guy strikes up a conversation with me.
LEADMALE:Turns out he owns the chain and wants me to be in a commercial.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, that's amazing! I'll say.
OTHERFEMALE:It's rare you find anybody in a mini-mall who even speaks English.
LEADFEMALE:OK.
LEADFEMALE:OK, Ma.
LEADMALE:Where are you going to shoot this commercial? Well, we discussed many exotic locations, and we settled on right here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, now hold on.
LEADMALE:I don't want a TV crew coming in here, messing up my kitchen, setting up all that video equipment.
OTHERMALE:How about shooting it in your bedroom, Blanche? The equipment's already set up.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, I don't think you're gonna have to worry.
LEADFEMALE:It's not gonna happen.
OTHERMALE:Has anybody seen a small bottle of pills? Brown bottle, Patton's pharmacy label, your name on the prescription? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Never saw it.
LEADMALE:Ma.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Yesterday, I was looking for the oregano and accidentally knocked them into the sink.
LEADFEMALE:I forgot all about it.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Now I won't be able to refill the prescription till tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Tomorrow's a holiday.
LEADMALE:Pharmacy's closed.
SUPMALE:Maybe I have another bottle in my room.
LEADFEMALE:I can't understand how you could forget to tell Rose about that accident.
LEADFEMALE:Forgive me, my memory's not as good as it used to be.
LEADMALE:Nothing on me is as good as it used to be.
SUPMALE:Once upon a time, I had a butt you could bounce a quarter on.
SUPFEMALE:Now you could lose a Krugerrand in the creases.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, meet my director Sy Ferber.
LEADFEMALE:Sy, my daughter Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Daughter? You're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Sy, I assure you, I won't be flattered if you say you thought she was my sister.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:I just had an idea.
SUPFEMALE:Little Slice of Sicily is a family restaurant, and a mother-daughter commercial would be great.
SUPMALE:How'd you like to be in it? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I'd have to check my schedule.
SUPFEMALE:You see, I'm a substitute teacher.
SUPFEMALE:Please! So someone else sets up the driver's-ed cones.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Ma.
SUPMALE:Actually, Sy, I'd be delighted to do it.
LEADMALE:Beautiful! Guess what.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to be in that commercial with Ma.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, I told you I don't want a bunch of strangers traipsing through my kitchen.
LEADMALE:We'll pay you $1,000 a day.
LEADFEMALE:Allow me to give you the grand tour.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, don't come in here.
LEADMALE:Everyone out! What's wrong, Rose? The slightest noise, and my humpaflagel cake will fall.
LEADMALE:Oh, why, why, why? Rose! Honey, calm down.
SUPFEMALE:You could make another cake.
LEADFEMALE:Look, we're gonna set it up over here.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, I'll put you here.
OTHERMALE:Sophia, I want you Excuse me, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
OTHERMALE:I'm very upset.
LEADMALE:Rose! This man is paying me $1,000 a day to make a commercial in my kitchen.
LEADMALE:I live here.
SUPMALE:I've every right to use this kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Miss, this'll only take a second.
OTHERMALE:It'll only take a second to knock you on your keister, buddy.
LEADFEMALE:What's it gonna be? Look, if I wanted this kind of abuse, I'd be directing The Roseanne Barr Show.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, but, Sy Look, the commercial is off.
LEADMALE:Just forget it.
LEADFEMALE:Well! Rose, now look what you did! I didn't do anything wrong.
LEADMALE:Rose, why are you acting like this? I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
LEADFEMALE:Get off my damn back! Dorothy, what time is it? Uh, 9:30.
LEADMALE:Why do you ask? Phyllis Gluckman is giving me a ride to my acting lesson.
LEADMALE:If I'm gonna be in a commercial, I wanna be good.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? The commercial is off.
LEADMALE:No, it isn't.
OTHERMALE:I got the director to change his mind.
LEADMALE:He's coming back here to shoot the commercial? No, he doesn't want to get anywhere near Rose.
LEADMALE:He's gonna shoot it at his studio.
LEADFEMALE:But if he shoots it at his studio, then I get screwed and have nothing to show for it.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome to show business.
LEADFEMALE: Well, goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Sophia.
OTHERMALE:Later.
SUPMALE:Hi, girls.
OTHERMALE:Oh, loved meeting your director friend yesterday.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, are you all right? Never better.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you ask? Maybe because yesterday you acted like a crazy person? Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I was a little on edge.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, it won't happen again.
LEADMALE:Rose, what are those pills for? The doctor prescribed them when I wrenched my back.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't know you'd hurt your back.
SUPMALE:It's an old farm injury from St.
SUPMALE:Olaf.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never forget when it happened.
LEADMALE:It was time to plant the crops, but after 17 years of pulling the plow, poor old Bessie was worn out.
SUPFEMALE:Why didn't you just get another mule? Bessie wasn't a mule.
OTHERFEMALE:She was a big fat lady who pulled farm plows for a living.
SUPMALE:For God's sake! What about tractors? Come on, Blanche.
SUPMALE:If she was too old to pull a plow, how could she ever pull a tractor? Anyway, we had to till the soil, so I volunteered to pull the plow, and I hurt my back.
LEADMALE:How long have you been taking these pills? I guess around 30 years.
SUPMALE:Rose, I doubt that your doctor wanted you to take those things for 30 years.
SUPFEMALE:What makes you such a medical expert? The doctor prescribed those pills, and I only take them when I need them.
LEADFEMALE:Have you ever considered the possibility that you might be dependent on them? Are you calling me an addict? I really resent that.
LEADMALE:You think I can't do without those? Here, you take 'em.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Rose! No, I insist.
SUPMALE:Obviously you don't believe me.
SUPMALE:This is the best way to prove it.
LEADMALE: Rose, what the hell are you doing? Oh, I couldn't sleep, so I decided to rearrange the kitchen cabinets.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry I woke you.
LEADFEMALE:Go on back to bed.
LEADMALE:Rose, what are you doing with these? Nothing.
SUPMALE:You were looking for those pills.
LEADMALE:Blanche, get rid of them.
LEADFEMALE:You can't do that.
LEADFEMALE:They're mine.
LEADMALE:Get rid of them.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you said you could take these or leave 'em.
LEADMALE:That's true, and right now, I wanna take them.
SUPMALE:Rose, you can't stop taking these pills.
LEADMALE:You have a problem.
LEADMALE:I can stop! And I'll start stopping tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Oh, boy, will you be proud of me.
LEADMALE:You just wait.
SUPFEMALE:Only I can't stop tonight.
LEADMALE:Why not? Because Because.
OTHERMALE:Because tonight is the anniversary of the death of my beloved cat Fluffy.
SUPFEMALE:You have never had cats.
LEADFEMALE:You're allergic.
LEADMALE:OK, it's the anniversary of the death of my beloved brother Fluffy.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna have to do better than that.
LEADMALE:Aw, give her some credit.
SUPFEMALE:The woman has never told a lie in her life.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody does it great the first time.
LEADMALE:Look, the truth is I can't stop tonight because I'm afraid.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know if I can.
LEADMALE:That's because you're hooked on these, Rose.
SUPMALE:But, honey, there's a place for people with this kind of problem.
LEADFEMALE:Please, what is she gonna do in the NBA? Rose, let us call a rehabilitation center for you.
LEADMALE:No, I don't need one of those places.
LEADFEMALE:I can't go to one of those places.
LEADMALE:I'd be too ashamed, too embarrassed.
LEADFEMALE:What is there to be ashamed of? You have a medical problem.
LEADMALE:Was Betty Ford embarrassed? Was Liza Minnelli embarrassed? She should have been.
LEADMALE:Did you see Arthur 2? Rose you have to do this.
LEADMALE:No, I can stop by myself.
SUPFEMALE:I can quit cold turkey.
LEADMALE:Cold turkey? After 30 years, doing it alone without professional help could be dangerous.
LEADFEMALE:I won't be alone.
LEADMALE:I'll be with you.
OTHERFEMALE:If you'll just see me through the night, I know I can lick this.
SUPMALE:Come on, what do you say, girls? Are you in this with me? You bet we are, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:This is what friendship is all about.
OTHERFEMALE:Banding together when the going gets tough.
LEADFEMALE:Sacrificing sleep and personal comfort.
OTHERFEMALE:Putting someone else's need ahead of your own.
SUPMALE:It's beautiful.
SUPFEMALE:Let me know how it turns out in the morning.
LEADMALE:Think this is gonna work? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:We should just go along with whatever she wants to do.
LEADFEMALE:The important thing is to keep Rose's mind occupied.
SUPMALE:Hey, give me some lipstick.
SUPFEMALE:I'll draw a face on my hand.
LEADMALE:What are you doing up? I've got an hour till my paper route starts, so I thought I'd do some chin-ups.
LEADMALE:I was worried about Rose.
OTHERMALE:I'm a member of this family, too.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Ma, that's really very sweet, considering we have to get up so darn early tomorrow for that commercial.
LEADMALE:I said she was family.
LEADMALE:I'd do anything for that girl.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, is everybody ready for a spirited game of Googenspritzer? Googenspritzer? You said we were gonna play Monopoly.
SUPFEMALE:I said it was like Monopoly, only instead of Atlantic City, they use St.
SUPFEMALE:Olaf geography.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll be the bank.
LEADMALE:Oh, good.
LEADMALE:There's the cashbox.
LEADMALE:Honey, this is empty.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I know.
LEADMALE:The St.
OTHERMALE:Olaf Bank was one of the first savings and loans to go under.
LEADFEMALE:Bad management? Bad contractor.
LEADMALE:They built the bank on marshland, and it sank.
LEADMALE:All that was left were a few deposit slips and a pen with a chain attached to it, floating in the muck.
OTHERFEMALE:Amazing.
LEADFEMALE:My story? No.
LEADFEMALE:My patience at this hour! Can we get on with this? OK, I'll go first.
LEADMALE: Four.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it says, "Pick a card.
SUPFEMALE:" How odd.
LEADFEMALE:I can either buy the library or the phone booth in the center of town.
OTHERMALE:I'll buy the library.
OTHERMALE:If I were you, I'd buy the phone booth.
LEADFEMALE:Why? People use the phone booth.
LEADMALE:It's my turn.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, six.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha! What luck! I own Logenbeuton Avenue! Ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Game's over, I win.
LEADFEMALE:You win? Rose, how? You bought one street in St.
SUPMALE:Olaf.
LEADFEMALE:I bought the only street in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf.
SUPMALE:That means I'm gonna tear down your phone booth.
LEADMALE:This is the stupidest game! I could just Dorothy, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I could just play all night.
SUPMALE:Set it up again, Rose.
LEADMALE:Rose, how about a piece of Bundt cake? Oh, no, thanks.
SUPMALE:I'll try some, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:"Try some.
OTHERFEMALE:" Right, like it's some big experiment, like you got no idea what it tastes like.
SUPMALE:Like you don't shovel it in by the pound every chance you get.
LEADMALE:Ma! Girls, I really don't feel very good.
LEADMALE:I gave this a shot, but I can't make it.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, yes, you can.
LEADMALE:No, I can't.
SUPMALE:I can't, Dorothy! It's too hard.
LEADMALE:I wish you'd all stop acting like you know what I'm going through because you don't.
OTHERMALE:You don't have any idea.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I might not have any idea what it's like to feel the kind of dependency you do, but there was a time in my life when I tried quittin' something.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, you don't mean? Sex, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I tried quittin' sex.
SUPFEMALE:Obviously you fell off the wagon.
LEADMALE:And onto a naval base.
SUPFEMALE:It was just after I'd lost George, and it just seemed an appropriate thing to do.
OTHERMALE:Of course it did.
SUPMALE:Your husband had just died.
SUPFEMALE:So what? I hadn't.
LEADFEMALE:The point is, I was still feeling a little vulnerable, and I was afraid if I got intimate with somebody too quickly, I might end up getting hurt, so I just gave it up, cold turkey.
LEADFEMALE:And it worked for you, Blanche? Well, not entirely.
SUPFEMALE:Barely a month had gone by before I started feeling those awful stirrings and urgings.
LEADMALE:I was like a spring-bloomin' peach bud just ripened to dewy fruition, waitin' to be plucked by the first handsome man to come my way.
LEADFEMALE:You were looking for some nooky.
OTHERMALE:Exactly.
LEADFEMALE:Then came the moment of truth.
LEADMALE:There was a man, he asked me to sleep with him.
LEADMALE:I said no.
LEADFEMALE:But I knew something greater than my will power was necessary for me to resist him, so I called my sister.
LEADFEMALE:Did she talk you through it? Oh, better than that.
SUPFEMALE:She drove straight over, took him by the throat, said if he ever tried that again, she'd shoot him through the head.
LEADMALE:Just because he made a pass at you? Oh, did I forget to mention that the man was my sister's husband? I'm going to bed.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you can't.
LEADMALE:Yes, she can.
LEADMALE:We're not proving anything by sitting here any longer.
LEADFEMALE:We might as well all go.
LEADMALE:I can't believe I'm hearing this.
SUPFEMALE:Does this mean you're giving up when you've gotten this far? No, it means I can see the sun coming up over the Donaldsons' house.
LEADFEMALE:It's morning.
LEADMALE:We made it! She's right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's wonderful! Oh, congratula
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet you feel better already.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I really do and mostly because you guys were there for me.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never be able to repay you.
OTHERMALE:Think nothing of it.
SUPFEMALE:We were glad to help.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm glad to hear you say that because if I can't sleep tonight, we might have to do it all over.
LEADMALE:So, when I say, "action," you pick up the pizza, taste it and say, "Mmm, that's a mighty tasty pizza.
SUPFEMALE:" Is everybody ready? Yeah uh, one thing.
SUPMALE:Do I look at my mother or at the camera? Look at the camera, and here's a little tip.
LEADMALE:Look at it like you're making love to it.
SUPMALE:It might help if you give her a reference she's more familiar with.
LEADMALE:OK, this is a rehearsal.
SUPMALE:We're gonna run through it once, and then we'll do it for real.
SUPMALE:And go! Guess what, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:I found you some real good pizza like you used to get in Sicily.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, do you stink.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, Dorothy, relax.
LEADFEMALE:Just try and be yourself.
OTHERMALE:You can do this.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'll get it this time.
LEADFEMALE:All right, here we go.
OTHERMALE:Everyone settle.
OTHERFEMALE:And go! Guess what, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:I've found some real Sicil No, that's not it.
LEADMALE:What is the line? "Ma, I found some real good pizza, just like you used to get back in Sicily.
LEADFEMALE:" Ah.
SUPFEMALE:Sy, now I know what the trouble is.
LEADMALE:There's something wrong with the line.
LEADMALE:That's why I can't say it.
SUPFEMALE:Something wrong with the line? I'm an English teacher.
LEADMALE:I should know.
SUPFEMALE:The reason I can't say it is because the line itself is not grammatical.
LEADFEMALE:See, it should be "really good pizza," not "real good.
LEADFEMALE:" "Perfect pizza with pizazz.
OTHERFEMALE:" Even better.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, I can act and write! Gee, I love this business! You don't mind if I make the change, do you? No, not at all.
LEADMALE:In fact, I think I want to make a change, too.
LEADMALE: OK, Dorothy, let's see ya smile! This one's for the camera.
LEADMALE:And action! Look, Grandma, I've found you a real good pizza, just like you used to get in Sicily.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm that's a mighty That's a mighty lousy pizza! Ma, you never tasted it before? No, and I never will again.
SUPMALE:What the hell are you doing? Sorry, Sy.
SUPMALE:You can't pay me enough to endorse that slime on a shingle.
LEADMALE:Ma, this is a nationwide commercial.
LEADFEMALE:There is a lot of money involved here.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:There are two things a Sicilian won't do
SUPFEMALE:lie about pizza and file a tax return.
LEADMALE:Forget it, Sy.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, spit it out! But, Dorothy Right now, Rose! This is Fred Flintstone.
SUPMALE:His nose is dissolved, but it's definitely Fred Flintstone.
LEADMALE:They're my vitamins.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry I didn't trust you.
OTHERMALE:Don't apologize.
LEADMALE:But I misjudged you, Rose.
SUPMALE:No, you didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Here are my pills.
LEADMALE:I took one last night.
OTHERFEMALE:But, Rose, you got through an entire night without them.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought you had it beat.
LEADFEMALE:So did I! Dorothy, when you were staying up with me, I felt like I was safe, that I could rely on your strength to get me through it.
LEADFEMALE:But, Dorothy, you're not enough.
SUPFEMALE:These are even stronger than you are.
LEADMALE:Honey, let me call a recovery center.
LEADFEMALE:No, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, this is not just gonna go away, Rose.
OTHERMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:But I think the first step is for me to make that call.
LEADMALE:Any sign of Rose? Not yet.
LEADMALE:You know, Dorothy, I'm a little nervous.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose was on those pills for 30 years.
SUPMALE:If one month in the hospital has helped her kick the habit, she may not be the same Rose we know.
LEADMALE:She may be an entirely different person.
LEADMALE:I know because it happened to me once.
SUPFEMALE:Before my mama sent me off to beauty camp, I was a pencil-thin, flat-chested, four-eyed nerd.
SUPFEMALE:I don't believe it.
LEADMALE:You pencil-thin? Hi, girls.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my gosh, have we missed you! Oh, Rose! You look wonderful! Gimme a big hug! I'm so happy to see you! Oh, sweetheart! Oh, Rose! It just must feel wonderful bein' cured! Oh, I'm not cured.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean? I'll never be cured, but I know now I can live without drugs my whole life, one day at a time.
SUPMALE:I'm just glad you got that monkey off your back.
SUPFEMALE:I never had a monkey on my back, Sophia.
SUPMALE:Although, when I was a child, I had a chicken named Gordon.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, and what a great chicken! And he was a great singer, too.
SUPMALE:Gordon could cluck the scores of all the big Broadway musicals.
LEADFEMALE:I've heard a lot of poultry do show tunes, but nobody could hold a candle to him.
SUPFEMALE:Of course, no chicken likes to be that near an open flame.
SUPFEMALE:Same old Rose.
LEADMALE:Same old Rose.
LEADMALE:Oh, anyway, he was a great entertainer.
LEADFEMALE:We thought for a while he was a great dancer, too, till we discovered he had two left wings.
LEADFEMALE:He'd just shuffle along there.
LEADMALE:Oh, how he loved music, especially Gilbert and Sullivan.
LEADFEMALE:Oh 
LEADMALE:
