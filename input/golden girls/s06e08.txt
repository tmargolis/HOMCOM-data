OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Rose, good God.
LEADMALE:My heart is still poundin'.
OTHERMALE:I was just in an accident.
LEADFEMALE:Honey.
LEADFEMALE:But don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:I'm all right.
LEADMALE:I'm OK.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank God.
SUPMALE:Any damage to your car? Well, that's the one bright spot.
LEADFEMALE:I had borrowed yours.
SUPFEMALE:My car? You didn't ask if you could borrow my car.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I guess we both learned a lesson about leaving keys on the table.
LEADMALE:I can't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:How did it happen? Well, you know how I like to meet rich men by gently rear-ending expensive cars at red lights? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, you say that like it isn't great.
SUPMALE:Rose, it's the perfect plan.
LEADMALE:You get to meet the guy, exchange addresses, then when he asks you who does good body work, you give him your phone number.
LEADMALE:And this really works? Well, not this time.
LEADMALE:I had this really cute guy in a Jag lined up when this dork in a Duster cut in front of me and I nicked him instead.
SUPMALE:Blanche, I am furious.
SUPMALE:First you take my car without asking.
LEADMALE:Then, when you have it, you show complete disregard for my personal property.
LEADMALE:Rose, please have a little compassion.
OTHERFEMALE:I was just in an accident.
OTHERMALE:Well, what do you want me to do, carry you to your room? Massage your neck? Make some cocoa? Diet cocoa.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm going out again tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Blanche Oh, hi, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:How was the funeral? It was a humdinger, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:We closed the place.
LEADMALE:Where's Sophia? She's taking this pretty hard.
SUPFEMALE:I guess she needs a couple of minutes by herself out in the car.
LEADMALE:We're really gonna have to be there for Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, Sophia's like my own mother.
LEADFEMALE:Until she feels better, I'm not gonna think about anything else.
SUPMALE:My car! It's ruined! It's just a little scratch.
LEADFEMALE:I can live with it.
OTHERMALE:What did you do with it? Rose Do we have to do this now? A nun has died.
OTHERMALE:More than a nun.
SUPMALE:Sister Agnes was my mother's best friend.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, she's out there alone now.
LEADFEMALE:She hasn't said a word since we left the cemetery.
LEADFEMALE:I have no idea how she's going to react to this.
LEADMALE:I've made a decision.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna become a nun.
LEADMALE:Well, at least now you know.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, what are you talking about? God spoke to me today at the funeral.
SUPFEMALE:He told me to join the order.
LEADFEMALE:God spoke to you? You haven't been eating chili dogs again, have you? That was an honest mistake.
LEADFEMALE:And to clarify, that's when I thought God was whistling to me.
LEADMALE:This was him talking.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you think I know how crazy this sounds? But it really happened.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, I don't believe you.
LEADFEMALE:God said you'd say that.
LEADMALE:Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:He said you'd say that, too.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, stop this.
LEADMALE:Three for three.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, this is ridiculous.
LEADMALE:You don't want to be a nun.
SUPMALE:Yes, I do, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:God reminded me today that I've always had a dream, a very private dream, one I never talked about.
OTHERFEMALE:When I was growing up, I wanted to join the convent.
LEADFEMALE:Well, until I was 17.
LEADFEMALE:What happened then? Your father put his hand in my blouse.
SUPMALE:So? So I felt soiled, filthy, dirty.
SUPFEMALE:You know, in love.
LEADMALE:But this time, I'm gonna fulfill my destiny.
LEADMALE:This time, I'm gonna become a nun.
LEADFEMALE:Do you believe what we just heard? I can't believe anybody would want to be a nun.
LEADMALE:I mean, "nun.
OTHERMALE:" The word says it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're not gonna believe this.
LEADMALE:I've just been talking on the phone for a half-hour, and guess what.
LEADFEMALE:You forgot to dial first? No You held the receiver upside down? Unh-unh.
SUPMALE:It wasn't even the phone, it was the TV remote control.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:A shoe? Blanche, please.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not an idiot.
SUPMALE:The TV has a remote control? Anyway, this could be kind of important.
LEADFEMALE:What? Do you remember Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Nivingston, the guy whose rear end you smacked? Well, my insurance company just called, and the guy is claiming he hurt his back.
LEADMALE:He's threatening a lawsuit unless we settle out of court.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's terrible.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm the one he's suing, 'cause it's my car.
LEADMALE:Oh! Ha-ha! Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you had me goin' there for a second.
SUPMALE:I thought you meant he was suing me.
LEADFEMALE:Whew.
SUPMALE:What? Blanche, Rose may be taken to court for something that you did.
LEADMALE:Don't you even care? There's nothing to worry about.
LEADFEMALE:He's just tryin' to hold up his insurance company.
SUPMALE:There's nothin' wrong with that man's back.
LEADMALE:How can you tell? Because I know the crooked walk of man when his back has been injured.
LEADFEMALE:I cannot tell you how many men I have seen limp out of my bedroom.
LEADFEMALE:Shoulders stooped and their backs curved.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, that's different.
LEADFEMALE:That's shame.
LEADMALE: Oh, Sister Claire, how nice to see you again.
LEADFEMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, this is Sister Claire.
LEADFEMALE:She interviewed me last week about joining her order.
LEADFEMALE:Please, sit down.
LEADMALE:Ma, you actually went to a convent? Why didn't I know that? Because you're divorced.
OTHERFEMALE:Technically, in the eyes of the church, you don't even exist.
LEADMALE:I spit on you.
SUPFEMALE:Unless, of course, the sister would like to spit on you first.
SUPFEMALE:I'm her daughter Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:You'll have to excuse my mother.
OTHERMALE:She suffered a slight stroke a few years ago which rendered her totally annoying.
SUPFEMALE:And, uh, what brings you here? The follow-up interview.
LEADMALE:We have very strict guidelines when selecting postulants, so we're going to put Sophia through a battery of psychological tests.
LEADMALE:It helps weed out the crazies and undesirables.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Can you imagine? Rose is tryin' to blame the whole thing on me.
LEADFEMALE:That woman has one hell of a lot of nerve.
SUPMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:I'm a Baptist.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Sister, is it all right if I sit in? I don't think my mother would mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Think again.
LEADFEMALE:I'd go outside, but there don't seem to be any shady pines to sit under.
OTHERFEMALE:Pillow, Pussycat? We'll start with the ink blots.
LEADMALE:Uh, "Who was a 1950s black singing group?" Am I right? Am I in? Am I a nun yet? She watches a lot of Jeopardy! No, no.
LEADFEMALE:You look at each one and tell me what you see.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a standard test used by psychologists, but we find it useful in our line of work, too.
LEADFEMALE:Now what do you see? I see an angel.
LEADMALE:Very good.
LEADMALE:How 'bout this one? Uh, I see a dove perched upon the throne of God.
SUPFEMALE:Excellent.
LEADMALE:And this? I see the Blessed Mother smiling sweetly as she pours love upon the hearts of the righteous standing at the gates of heaven, while St.
LEADMALE:Peter Ma! Come on, you're making that up.
LEADFEMALE:I am not.
LEADFEMALE:Look, anyone can clearly see that is a picture of John Forsythe lying naked in a pool of honey Isn't it? Do you think I would lie to get into the convent? It does look a little like John Forsythe, doesn't it? Look, sister, I'm sorry you made this trip for nothing, but this has gone far enough.
LEADMALE:Ma, I cannot believe that you actually want to go through with this.
LEADMALE:Who cares what you believe? I had a beautiful experience.
OTHERMALE:God has called me, and I intend to answer.
OTHERFEMALE:You're really serious about this, aren't you? Yes, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:This means a lot to me.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think I could leave you that easily? A minute ago you were gonna spit on me.
OTHERMALE:Do you have this much trouble with your kids? What's wrong, Rose? It's my insurance company.
SUPFEMALE:They've cut me off because of the lawsuit.
SUPFEMALE:What am I gonna do? Well, you need a good lawyer.
LEADFEMALE:Give me the keys to your rental, and I'll go out and see if I can nail one for you.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, that's how you got me in trouble before.
LEADMALE:Isn't there anything else you can do? Well, I suppose we could prove Mr.
SUPMALE:Nivingston was faking his injury if we could trick him into performing certain physical acts of a sexual nature.
LEADMALE:All we'd need is a devastatingly beautiful woman with a flair for seduction.
LEADMALE:How about Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Hufstad down the street? I mean, she's something of a dog, but she'll do it with anybody.
LEADFEMALE:I was talkin' about me.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You will, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, I won't go all the way.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just get him in the bedroom and, uh, put him through the normal warm-ups.
LEADFEMALE:And we'll have a certain Scandinavian nitwit hidin' in the closet with a camera.
LEADFEMALE:Wouldn't it be better if I hid in the closet? Yes, Rose, I suppose it would.
LEADMALE:But do you really think you can get him to remove the neck brace? Oh, please.
SUPFEMALE:I once got a man to crawl out of a full body cast.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm almost ready to go.
LEADMALE:Today? You're not goin' today? Why didn't you tell us? Every time I bring it up, one of you tries to talk me out of it.
LEADFEMALE:We were just being selfish.
SUPFEMALE:We didn't wanna lose you.
SUPMALE: There's my ride.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Sophia.
OTHERMALE:Yep.
LEADFEMALE:It's a Granada full of nuns.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, you have no idea how much we're gonna miss you.
LEADMALE:It's like losing a member of the family.
LEADMALE:Rose is right.
LEADMALE:You're just like a mother to us.
SUPFEMALE:We feel like your daughters, too.
OTHERFEMALE:I feel the same way.
LEADMALE:Rose, just remember, you're smarter than people say you are.
OTHERFEMALE:You've got common sense and you know what you're doing.
LEADMALE:Oh, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Blanche, you're a slut.
LEADMALE:Oh, Sophia.
SUPMALE: Well, I better go.
LEADFEMALE:Nuns don't keep well in a hot car.
LEADFEMALE:We'll go out and tell 'em you're on your way.
SUPMALE:Come on, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess this is it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just so sorry that it took me so long to realize how much this meant to you.
LEADFEMALE:It's just very hard for me to let go.
LEADFEMALE:Me too.
LEADFEMALE:But someone else needs me more.
OTHERFEMALE:It's time for me to move on.
LEADFEMALE:My job here is done.
LEADMALE:I always love it when you talk like the Lone Ranger.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, I want you to know that I support your decision.
OTHERFEMALE:I think you'll make a great nun.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I needed to hear that.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, Ma.
SUPMALE:I love you, too, Tonto.
LEADMALE:Careful, Arthur.
OTHERMALE:Watch your step.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, if I only could.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, forgive me, sugar.
SUPFEMALE:Well, here, I'll watch it for you, you poor thing.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I can't believe how nice you're being to me even though I'm suing your friend.
LEADMALE:Well, I've always been attracted to ever-so-slightly younger men.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, just look at you.
LEADMALE:Ooh! Must be so frustratin' for an athlete like you.
LEADFEMALE:Did you ever play any college ball? No.
LEADFEMALE:As a boy, I got as far as the Pee-Wee leagues, but then I discovered stamps.
OTHERFEMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:You know, when I first saw you, I said to myself, "Philatelist.
SUPMALE:" I like that.
LEADMALE:Ooh, you're gettin' so tense.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, why don't we go in my bedroom, see if we can't loosen you up a little? Oh, I'm not sure.
OTHERFEMALE:See, my lawyer/n I mean, my doctor/n Sorry.
LEADMALE:I get 'em mixed up.
SUPFEMALE:They're both in the same mall.
SUPMALE:You just forget about that old doctor.
LEADMALE:I know a little bit about physical therapy myself.
LEADMALE:I'm sure you do, but, you see/n If it'll make you feel better, I have a complete nurse's outfit hangin' up in my closet.
LEADFEMALE:I gotta tell you, that does make me feel better.
LEADMALE:What else have you got in there? Ooh, ho-ho-ho-ho.
LEADMALE:Wait! What am I doing? I can't play nursey.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'm supposed to have whiplash.
LEADMALE:If we can't be together soon, I'm gonna have to go with somebody else.
LEADMALE:I haven't been with a man since my husband died nine years ago, and I'm just about ready to explode.
SUPFEMALE:I'll see you tomorrow, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Boy, this is really beginning to chafe.
LEADFEMALE:Ar-- Were you able to get him to bed? No.
LEADFEMALE:Rose still in the closet with the camera? Yes.
SUPMALE:Maybe you'll get him tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, Rose.
OTHERMALE:Out of the closet, I see.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I'm back.
OTHERMALE:Look, I got a card from Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, read it out loud.
LEADFEMALE:"Dear Pussycat, I have everything I need, but it's hard to get a decent bikini wax.
OTHERFEMALE:" Oh! Ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha.
SUPMALE:"Dorothy, I remember you fondly, and the same goes for Blanche and Rita.
SUPFEMALE:" "Wish you were here.
LEADFEMALE:"No one can reach the third shelf in the pantry.
OTHERFEMALE:Best, Sister Ma.
OTHERMALE:"  God, I miss that woman.
LEADMALE:Say what you want about her, we all loved having her around.
SUPMALE:I miss someone to have a chat with at midnight.
LEADMALE:You know what I'm gonna miss most about Sophia? The way she used to tease me.
LEADFEMALE:The way she would ever-so-subtly jab me with names like "tramp" "Floozy.
LEADMALE:" "Trollop," "harlot.
SUPMALE:" "Magic carpet ride.
SUPFEMALE:" "The human luge.
LEADMALE:" But she was never cuter than when she simply called you "shore leave.
LEADMALE:" Oh, God, I miss that woman.
OTHERMALE:OK, is everybody in? I got a pair of jacks.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
OTHERMALE:Wait, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:I have the two, seven, jack, ten and/n that's right/n a four.
LEADMALE:That doesn't beat a pair of jacks.
LEADMALE:Well, it did when you had it.
SUPMALE:I told you.
OTHERMALE:That's called a "Whizzer.
LEADFEMALE:" It's only good once a night.
SUPMALE:Uh, I'll be putting this in the collection box later.
OTHERMALE:Sophia? Clear out.
LEADFEMALE:It's the man.
LEADMALE:Hello, Reverend Mother.
LEADMALE:My, you look holier-than-thou today.
SUPMALE:Save it, Sister Suck Up.
SUPFEMALE:How do you explain this note I found in the suggestion box? You said we needed money for the chapel.
LEADFEMALE:I thought that would be a good fund-raiser.
SUPMALE:A beefcake calendar of "Monks of the Midwest"? Oh, come on.
SUPMALE:Open up your mind.
LEADMALE:Sophia, I'm going to go pray now.
LEADFEMALE:I won't tell you what I'm going to pray for because it would hurt your feelings.
LEADFEMALE:But when I'm done, I expect a complete change of attitude.
SUPFEMALE:Understand? Ooh, I'm so scared.
SUPMALE:What is she gonna do, take away my self-denial privileges? Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Pussycat, what are you doin' here? Oh, I just missed you and wanted to say hi and see how you're doin'.
LEADFEMALE:I'm doin' fine.
LEADFEMALE:Ten days celibate.
SUPMALE:Same here.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, I have a little surprise for you.
LEADFEMALE:Girls? Oh Look who it is.
LEADMALE:It's Blanche and Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Where's the surprise? Honey, we're your surprise.
LEADFEMALE:We came to see you.
OTHERMALE:Nice to see you.
SUPFEMALE:What a lovely surprise.
LEADMALE:Welcome to our little convent.
LEADFEMALE:Not even a Bundt cake, huh? Look at you.
LEADFEMALE:A nun.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't think I'd be shocked like this.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that you look so different than when Blanche is dressed as a nun.
LEADMALE:So, uh, what's new at home? Oh, I did get a chance to go into your bedroom, Sophia, and there's just no way I'll be able to refund your cleaning deposit.
LEADFEMALE:Totally understandable.
SUPFEMALE:I'll see you in court, my child.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:Mother Superior, this is my daughter Dorothy and my ex-roommates.
OTHERMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, why don't you run along? I need to talk to your daughter alone.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Whatever she says, I have an alibi.
LEADMALE:So, Dorothy, I'll bet you love your mother a lot.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that depends.
LEADFEMALE:What has she done? It's not necessarily anything specific.
LEADMALE:It's my feeling that life here is too structured for her.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid I don't follow you.
SUPFEMALE:She is a stubborn, old, vindictive pack mule of a woman who won't follow the rules.
OTHERFEMALE:OK, I'm back with you.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I think her intentions are good, but this doesn't seem to be her calling.
LEADMALE:Oh, but this means so much to her.
LEADMALE:Oh, this would break her heart.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask her to leave.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mother Superior, with your permission, may I be the one to tell her? We've been through so much together, I'm sure that any bit of bad news would be easier to take if it came from me.
LEADMALE:Well, then, here's another one for you.
LEADFEMALE:We've seen her room.
SUPMALE:Tell her she won't be getting her cleaning deposit back.
LEADFEMALE:God, I'm so confused.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know where I belong.
LEADMALE:I'm trying to wrestle with the deep religious questions of the ages.
OTHERMALE:Like, what do you really want from me? What is my real purpose in life? What was Edward G.
SUPFEMALE:Robinson doing in The Ten Commandments?  Come in.
SUPMALE:Ma, where are Blanche and Rose? Oh, they wanted to browse in the gift shop.
OTHERFEMALE:They're having a sale on John the Baptist placemats.
LEADMALE:Ma, do you remember that summer you told me I didn't get into Girl Scout camp, and you said we were gonna have more fun than any two people ever had? They want me out? Yesterday.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, I don't get it.
SUPFEMALE:I know God wants my life to be meaningful.
SUPMALE:That's not gonna happen unless I'm here.
LEADMALE:Ma, your life is meaningful.
LEADFEMALE:You do nothing but help other people.
SUPMALE:You do Meals On Wheels, Red Cross, volunteer hospital work.
SUPFEMALE:The point is, you don't have to be in a convent to make your life meaningful.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, Sister Agnes belonged here, but you don't.
SUPFEMALE:So who's gonna take Sister Agnes' place? Nobody can take her place.
LEADMALE:Just like nobody can take your place.
LEADMALE:I miss her.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go home.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:But I'll be missing movie night.
LEADFEMALE:But so what? After the tenth time, it isn't the greatest story ever told.
LEADMALE:Here you go, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Guess it's gonna take you a little while to get adjusted to being home from the convent, hmm? To tell you the truth, Dorothy, it isn't that much different.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! Give me that film.
LEADMALE:Rose, go! Run! Good to have you home, Ma.
OTHERMALE:
