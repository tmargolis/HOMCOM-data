LEADMALE:Hi, Ma.
OTHERMALE:What are you making?
SUPMALE:History.
SUPMALE:You finally perfected your non-rolling meatball? Just because you have a chin doesn't mean you're Jay Leno.
SUPMALE:Ooh, what smells so good in here? Besides me? Lasagna ala Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:I made it for the Daughters of Italy cooking contest.
SUPMALE: All right, all right.
OTHERMALE:You twisted my arm.
SUPFEMALE:It's good.
LEADMALE:It's delicious.
LEADFEMALE:It's garbage.
SUPFEMALE:No, what are you talking about? You can't fool me.
OTHERFEMALE:I watched your faces.
SUPFEMALE:Neither one of you got the look.
LEADFEMALE:What look? The look that every cook knows and dreams about.
OTHERMALE:The look of total instant pleasure.
LEADMALE:Your father put that look on my face once.
SUPFEMALE:That's nice, Ma.
LEADMALE:Nice? I said once.
OTHERFEMALE:We were married 52 years.
OTHERMALE:The mail's here.
LEADMALE:Rose, what's wrong? Oh, nothing.
LEADMALE:It's just a letter I got.
SUPMALE:It's bad news.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's eerie.
OTHERFEMALE:I had the same feeling.
LEADMALE:My Aunt Gretchen in Fort Lauderdale died.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Rose.
LEADMALE:Honey, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Were you close to Aunt Gretchen? No, I couldn't stand her.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, Rose.
SUPMALE:Honey, if you didn't like your aunt, why are you so upset? Because I have to speak at her funeral.
SUPFEMALE:I'm terrified of speaking in front of people.
OTHERMALE:It's my biggest fear in the world.
LEADMALE:Why can't somebody else speak? Generptionloken.
LEADMALE:It's a family tradition.
LEADMALE:It means the oldest niece has to give the eulogy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, not literally.
LEADMALE:Literally, it's a herring poacher you can wear as a sun visor.
LEADFEMALE:The family got together and they decided that was close enough.
LEADMALE:Rose, I take it that no member of your family was ever a returning champion on Jeopardy.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, that's why I have to speak.
LEADMALE:How I've dreaded this day coming.
LEADFEMALE:I just can't do it! Rose, calm down.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, now listen.
OTHERMALE:I know an easy way to get through this.
LEADMALE:The way to relax when you have to speak in front of a group is to imagine what they all look like naked.
LEADFEMALE:Really?
LEADFEMALE: Yep.
LEADFEMALE:And if you do it right, you'll probably even start to laugh.
LEADFEMALE: Hi, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, what is that smell? The sweet smell of success.
SUPMALE:It's my new entry in the cooking contest.
SUPMALE:Veal parmesan, my luckiest dish.
OTHERFEMALE:It saved my marriage once.
LEADMALE:Ma, you gonna tell a story? Please, does Heifetz rosin a bow? This is a tearjerker.
OTHERMALE:Picture this.
LEADFEMALE:New York City, 1931.
LEADFEMALE:The Depression.
OTHERMALE:Your father and I are newlyweds.
SUPFEMALE:One rainy night, we have our first fight.
LEADFEMALE:He says he's leaving, I say fine.
SUPMALE:He goes out the door, I start to cook.
LEADFEMALE:A few hours later, he comes back.
LEADMALE:He says he couldn't find a cab.
LEADFEMALE:We eat in silence.
LEADFEMALE:Halfway through, I look up.
LEADFEMALE:He's got tears in his eyes.
SUPMALE:He tells me, "This meal is like our marriage.
LEADMALE:" The veal is like him, tough and stubborn.
LEADMALE:The tomato sauce is like me, hot and spicy.
SUPFEMALE:And the mozzarella is like our 
SUPMALE:It stretches but it never breaks.
LEADMALE:Ma, that's lovely, but I don't see what luck had to do with it.
SUPMALE:You were conceived that night, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Ma What's lucky is your father never knew or he never would have eaten my veal again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, now you'll just do fine.
SUPFEMALE:No, I won't.
LEADMALE:I remember the last time I tried to give a speech.
OTHERMALE:I was in high school.
SUPFEMALE:You wanna hear about it? Would you follow us if we tried to make a run for it? Yes.
SUPMALE:It was my high school graduation.
SUPMALE:I was valedictorian.
LEADFEMALE:You were valedictorian? Yes.
LEADMALE:I was fourth out of 19 graduating seniors.
SUPMALE:Anyway
LEADFEMALE: Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Rose, if you were fourth, how were you chosen valedictorian? The same way every high school chooses the valedictorian.
SUPFEMALE:We drew straws.
SUPFEMALE:And you picked the biggest one.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like to brag Anyway, the topic of my speech was "There's a big world out there but you have to change buses in Tyler's Landing to see it.
SUPMALE:" Graduation day came and everybody was there.
SUPMALE:The mayor was there, his wife, old Johannson, young Johannson, big and little Gustav, the Stringmeyer twins, fat Jerry Will you get to the point, Rose? The point is I choked.
LEADFEMALE:Roped out, froze on the spot.
LEADMALE:Since then, I've never been able to speak in front of a crowd.
LEADMALE:I say next time, we try and outrun her.
LEADMALE:Listen.
LEADFEMALE:You're not the only one who's gone through this.
LEADFEMALE:I had a phobia too.
OTHERFEMALE:You, Dorothy? You were afraid of something? Big, old, strong, strapping thing like you? Who am I, Joe Frasier? I had a fear of flying, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:And my sister, Gloria, got married in California.
LEADFEMALE:Course I had to go.
LEADFEMALE:So I got myself some therapy.
OTHERMALE:And it worked.
LEADMALE:It's nothing to be ashamed of.
SUPMALE:Everybody is afraid of something.
LEADFEMALE:What are you afraid of, Blanche? Nothing.
LEADMALE:You're a real team player, aren't you, Blanche? I'm not afraid of anything now.
OTHERMALE:But I sure used to be.
LEADFEMALE:Not a phobia, exactly, but something just as bad.
LEADMALE:A recurring dream.
SUPMALE:Night after night, I had this awful dream that I was trapped in an enclosed space full of men.
SUPFEMALE:Now what could that mean?
LEADMALE:Let's give this a second.
LEADFEMALE:Now, wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:There's more to it.
SUPFEMALE:All the men were bald.
LEADMALE:Just me and a bunch of bald men.
OTHERMALE:Oh, and I kept hearing the voice of God.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, one day I just finally said to 
LEADFEMALE:"Blanche, you are bigger than this.
LEADMALE:You don't have to succumb to any dream.
OTHERMALE:Unless it involves meeting Mel Gibson at an oyster bar.
SUPMALE:" And just like that it stopped.
OTHERMALE:Mind over matter, you can do the same thing, Rose.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE: Oh, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Of course you can.
OTHERMALE:Think positively.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, why don't you go to your room now and start working on your speech and in a while you can try it out in front of me and Dorothy, okay?
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, go on.
LEADFEMALE:Go on! Go on.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna tell you something.
LEADMALE:I'm sure glad I am not in her shoes.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'd hate to have to give a eulogy.
SUPFEMALE:What if it was my eulogy?
SUPMALE:What?
LEADMALE:What if you were giving a eulogy for me? What would you say?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I'm serious, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:What would you say? Well, I I guess I'd say that you were a lovely generous person.
LEADFEMALE:And, you know, one of the best friends I ever had.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing about my looks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'd say that you were one of the prettiest friends
LEADFEMALE:"One of'?
LEADFEMALE:"The," Blanche.
SUPMALE:The prettiest.
SUPFEMALE:What would you say about me?
LEADMALE:Dorothy, come on.
LEADFEMALE:I told you, you can tell me.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I would say I always felt safe having you in the house.
LEADFEMALE:And I would say I always enjoyed talking to you when I'd come home from one of my numerous dates.
LEADMALE:And I would say I always looked up to you like an older sister.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, and I forgot one thing.
LEADMALE:I would also say you're fat.
LEADFEMALE:I'm ready to practice my eulogy.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, if you'll stand by the barbecue.
SUPMALE:That's where Aunt Lib will be.
LEADMALE:Where should I be? Right there.
LEADFEMALE:That's where Uncle Gunther will be.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and it would help if you'd hum.
SUPFEMALE:Is that part of the Viking funeral? No, Uncle Gunther just hums a lot.
LEADFEMALE:If he has something important to say he spells it out in salt.
OTHERFEMALE:Unless he's quoting a song by the Four Tops.
LEADFEMALE:Then he spells it out
LEADFEMALE: In pepper.
LEADMALE:Rose, can we just get on with the speech? Okay.
OTHERMALE:Um Friends, family, Aunt Gretchen was a special person.
SUPFEMALE:She She What's the point? I can't do it.
SUPMALE:Of course you can, Rose.
LEADMALE:You were doing just fine.
SUPMALE:That's because you were here.
LEADFEMALE:Tomorrow, I'll be out there all alone, staring at my relatives, who'll be ready to hoot and snicker at the first crack in my voice.
LEADFEMALE:They'll think I'm an idiot.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, it's family.
SUPFEMALE:They know you're an idiot.
LEADFEMALE:There's only one way I'm gonna get through this.
LEADFEMALE:If you two will come with me to the funeral for support.
SUPMALE:Oh, will you do it? Please, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Please, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Please, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I will if Dorothy will.
LEADMALE:Please! If you really think it'll help, Rose, of course we'll do it.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:You are the best friends I've ever had.
SUPMALE:Before I lose the nerve, I better make the plane reservations.
SUPFEMALE:Did she say "plane reservations"? I thought her aunt lived in Fort Lauderdale.
LEADFEMALE:She did, big mouth.
OTHERMALE:But she's being buried in the Bahamas where she spent her winters.
LEADFEMALE:Damn.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have one thing in black that isn't see-through.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, Dorothy, it's good you got over your fear of flying.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, right.
SUPMALE:The way you used to carry on.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Remember when we went to your Uncle Michael's wedding in Arizona? Before we boarded the plane, you threw yourself on the ground, kicking and screaming.
SUPMALE:It was a little embarrassing.
LEADFEMALE:I'll say.
SUPMALE:You were 48.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's all behind me now.
LEADMALE:I tell you, I really feel very comfortable on planes.
LEADMALE:Good, you'll probably have to take a dinky little plane to the Bahamas.
LEADMALE:They flutter, they shimmy, they wobble You got a lot of guts, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Please don't let them take me! What are you reading? I'm checking the weather in the Bahamas.
LEADFEMALE:It's gonna be in the upper 80's with a nice gentle breeze.
SUPFEMALE:So with that outdoor service, we'll come away with healthy color.
SUPFEMALE:Aunt Gretchen always loved the sun.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe they'll have an open casket.
OTHERMALE:Girls, I have some bad news.
LEADMALE:I am not gonna be able to go with you.
LEADMALE:Why not?
LEADMALE:It's Ma.
LEADFEMALE:She's sick.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna have to take her to the hospital.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:She left for that cooking contest about ten minutes ago.
LEADMALE:She called.
SUPMALE:She had a bad cannoli when she got there.
LEADFEMALE:Right now, she's doubled over with cramps, crying out with pain, and making the most spectacular comeback since Dennis Hopper.
OTHERMALE:Are you all right, Sophia? Of course I'm all right.
LEADFEMALE:Halfway to the contest I realized I forgot the wine.
LEADMALE:For your mussels marinara?
OTHERFEMALE:No, for me.
SUPFEMALE:I always drink wine during cooking contests and my sister Sam.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, Sophia's not sick.
LEADFEMALE:She didn't eat a bad cannoli.
SUPMALE:Whoever called and said that was just making the whole thing up.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, Dorothy made the whole thing up.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't want to go with us.
LEADMALE:But you promised you'd go.
LEADMALE:I know, that's what I said.
SUPFEMALE:All I can say now is tough! I'm not getting on that plane and you can't make me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then I'm not going either.
SUPMALE:Oh, I don't believe my ears.
SUPFEMALE:Girls! The entire purpose of this trip is to conquer our fears.
LEADMALE:Why, if we back out now, that'd mean our fears have conquered us.
LEADFEMALE: I will not allow that.
LEADMALE:We're gonna march out that door right now, like the strong confidant women I know we are.
OTHERFEMALE:Chins up, chests out, buttocks tight.
SUPMALE:I know "buttocks tight" has nothing to do with it, it just looks good.
SUPMALE:Buttocks tight, I said.
LEADFEMALE:Buttocks tight! Oh, forget it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:You're just doing beautifully.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody would dream you have a fear of flying.
SUPFEMALE:Unless they happen to glance at the bruises on my forearm.
LEADMALE:You think you could hold on to something else for a while? Oh, of course, honey, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Oh!
OTHERMALE:I meant like the arm rest.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Look, girls.
SUPMALE:I found this bolt in the aisle.
LEADMALE:Where do you think it goes? With me, off this plane.
LEADFEMALE:What was that?
SUPMALE:Them shutting the door.
SUPFEMALE:They shut the door?  Afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
LEADMALE:My name is Candy.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be your flight hostess.
SUPMALE:Please review the information cards in your seat pockets for the safety information in the unlikely event
LEADFEMALE:of a mishap during our flight.
LEADFEMALE:Mishap? What does she mean
LEADMALE:What does she mean by mishap?
LEADFEMALE:Like, bad movies or cold food or running out of ice.
LEADFEMALE:Running out of gas
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:God.
OTHERMALE:Will you just calm down?
LEADMALE:Drink champagne.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like champagne.
SUPMALE:Go ahead, it might relax you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Didn't make me relaxed.
OTHERMALE:Just makes me wanna burp.
SUPMALE:We burp and the pressure in the cabin will change and we'll fly into a mountain.
SUPMALE:That would be a good example of a mishap.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, do me a favor, fasten your seat belt.
SUPFEMALE:Over your mouth! Why don't we use our time constructively and work on your eulogy.
LEADFEMALE:What are you planning to say? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I'll probably start out talking about Aunt Gretchen, the person.
SUPMALE:She was always a very rigid person.
LEADMALE:Especially now.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess that maybe that champagne did relax me.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my God.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my God, girls, oh, my God, look! What, Blanche, what? Look, all the men on this plane are bald! It's all right, Blanche.
LEADMALE:The captain just turned off the "no bald men" sign.
LEADMALE:I am talking about my recurring dream.
SUPFEMALE:Remember? I'm trapped in an enclosed space full of bald men.
LEADMALE:Well, I didn't tell you the rest of it.
OTHERFEMALE:All those bald men and I are on a plane and we fly into the ocean.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on now, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:You're behaving just as crazy as we are.
LEADFEMALE:It's just a coincidence.
OTHERFEMALE: Ladies and gentlemen, be sure your seat belts are securely fastened in preparation for the take off.
SUPFEMALE:And if anyone found a big bolt, please return it to me.
SUPFEMALE: It came off the beverage cart.
LEADMALE:Yes, that's it.
LEADFEMALE:The beverage cart.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, it is not a coincidence.
LEADMALE:It is my nightmare and it's coming true.
OTHERMALE:Don't be silly, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Not all of it's coming true.
LEADFEMALE:You haven't heard the voice of God.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE: Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Lord.
OTHERFEMALE:I hope you enjoy your flight.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy
LEADMALE:We made a rule.
LEADMALE:No talking, it shakes the plane.
OTHERFEMALE:I just had to say one thing.
LEADMALE:If Blanche is right, and we are gonna die this afternoon,
LEADMALE:I'm glad we're together.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, that's very comforting.
LEADFEMALE:Now, shut up.
LEADMALE:I know what you mean, Rose.
OTHERMALE:We have had some very special times together.
LEADMALE: Like the time there was that hurricane and all the power went out for two days and we huddled together to keep warm and sang campfire songs
SUPMALE:and told stories.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:And Rose admitted that Charlie was the only man she ever slept with.
OTHERFEMALE:And you admitted Stan was the only man you ever slept with.
LEADFEMALE:And I admitted my shoe size was really five and a half.
SUPMALE:I wish we had more time together.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, what are we doing? The flight has been perfectly smooth.
LEADMALE:There hasn't been a hint of turbulence.
LEADFEMALE: This is Captain Lord.
OTHERFEMALE:Looks like we're running right into the IT of a tropical storm.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a dead woman.
LEADMALE:Unfortunately, that means we're going to turn around and return to Miami.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
OTHERMALE:Did you hear that, girls? We're saved.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean?
LEADMALE:That part wasn't in my dream.
SUPFEMALE:The dream's broken.
SUPMALE:We're going back to Miami.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna be all right.
SUPFEMALE:Not me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you two faced your fears.
LEADMALE:Dorothy got on the plane, you faced your dream, I didn't give my speech.
SUPFEMALE:Give it now.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Go on.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, you wrote it, you give it.
LEADFEMALE:Go on, you can do it.
SUPFEMALE:Uh everyone? I was supposed to speak at a funeral this afternoon, and now I can't, but I'd still like to give my speech, if no one minds.
SUPMALE:I wrote some things down but I'd just rather talk.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, the funeral was for my Aunt Gretchen.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't know her well.
LEADFEMALE:The only thing I remembered about her is she used to scare me.
SUPFEMALE:Jumping out of my closet at night, putting false fangs in her mouth, sometimes baying at the moon.
OTHERMALE:Now her dying scares me.
LEADMALE:But there's a good part to being scared.
LEADMALE:You get to know who your friends are.
LEADMALE:They're the ones who help you not be scared.
LEADMALE:Maybe that's what Aunt Gretchen was trying to do all along.
LEADMALE:Help me not be scared.
LEADMALE:I think so.
SUPMALE:Goodbye, Aunt Gretchen.
OTHERMALE:Take a seat, lady.
LEADMALE:This isn't the Copacabana.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, that was beautiful.
SUPMALE:It was, it truly was.
OTHERFEMALE: Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Lord again.
LEADFEMALE:If you all look out the left side of our aircraft, it'll tip over.
LEADMALE:Sorry, just a little small airplane pilot humor.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Ma.
LEADMALE:What the hell are you doing home? Ma, let's not get all mushy.
LEADFEMALE:You chickened out, didn't you? No, we went, or at least we started to.
SUPFEMALE:Halfway there we ran into a tropical storm so we had to turn around and come back.
LEADFEMALE:And the plane was entirely full of bald men.
SUPFEMALE:They were all former Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Cleans on their way to a reunion in the Bahamas.
LEADMALE:So, tell us about the cooking contest.
SUPFEMALE:The competition was fierce.
OTHERFEMALE:It came down to my mussels marinara, and Louise Pallito's chicken cacciatore.
LEADMALE:Louise Pallito? Isn't she the one who brags about being Al Capone's piano teacher? True.
OTHERFEMALE:103 years old.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, the judges voted.
LEADMALE:It was a flat-footed tie.
SUPMALE:That's when it went into sudden death.
SUPFEMALE:And? I just told you, it was sudden death.
SUPMALE:Louise couldn't take it.
SUPMALE:She keeled over.
LEADMALE:Kaput! The funeral is on Saturday.
LEADMALE:Sophia, that's terrible.
LEADFEMALE:You think that's bad? Guess who I volunteered to give the eulogy? 
SUPFEMALE:
