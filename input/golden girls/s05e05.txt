LEADMALE:Hi, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I tell you, there is nothing more invigorating than spending a little time on a boat.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah? Not when I sailed to America.
LEADFEMALE:Picture it.
LEADFEMALE:There we were
SUPFEMALE:a tired, poor, huddled mass eating marinara sauce out of a can.
LEADMALE:It was hell.
SUPMALE:And the entertainment? Some guy from Palermo forgot his accordion, so he sat around singing "0 Solo Mio" while squeezing a monkey.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia.
LEADMALE:Sophia what? It was the worst time of my life.
LEADFEMALE:If it weren't for pin the tail on the French, we would've gone stir-crazy.
SUPMALE:Hi, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Rose, I was just telling Sophia what a wonderful day we had.
SUPFEMALE:Wonderful, my foot.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, you saw that dolphin.
OTHERMALE:All tangled up in that tuna boat's net.
LEADFEMALE:Thousands of them die that way each year.
LEADFEMALE:We have to do something.
OTHERMALE:You are absolutely right.
SUPMALE:From this moment on, no more tuna fish.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, you hate tuna fish.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Then no more tuna fishermen.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, girls.
LEADFEMALE:Do these pearls look OK with this? Honey, pearls look fine with everything, from the fanciest dress to that.
LEADFEMALE:You have another date with Ken.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Sophia, do you believe it? And I thought my head was spinning from the splash of vino in my lemonade.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, you don't put wine in your lemonade.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:I don't.
OTHERFEMALE:It was a joke.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Your Ken is quite a catch, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:For once I'm a bit jealous.
OTHERMALE:What's not to be jealous about? The man's gorgeous.
OTHERFEMALE:He's got money and class.
SUPMALE:I couldn't be happier for you, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I just want to give you a loving mother's 
LEADFEMALE:Don't blow it! Ma, I have no intention of blowing this.
SUPMALE:No, Ken is perfect.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, aside from being one of Miami's most successful lawyers Thank you, Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:The man is caring.
SUPMALE:He's sensitive.
LEADMALE:Do you know that on weekends, he actually puts on a clown's costume and entertains sick kids at the hospital?  I mean, what more could I want from a man? Get it out of the gutter, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:How was your day? My ulcer didn't flare up and I'm having dinner with you.
OTHERFEMALE:So I guess it's perfect.
SUPMALE:Hi, Ken.
LEADMALE:Hey, Kenny.
SUPMALE:What's a nice boy like you doing with ulcers anyway? You got a job and a girl who'll do anything for you.
LEADFEMALE:Anything.
OTHERFEMALE:You will, won't you, Dorothy? I'll take that as a "Have a good time.
SUPFEMALE:" Don't worry, Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Petrillo.
LEADFEMALE:I'll have your little girl home at a reasonable hour.
SUPFEMALE:Don't bother.
LEADFEMALE:You kids have fun.
OTHERMALE:I won't wait up.
SUPMALE:Have her back by Tuesday.
SUPMALE:No questions asked.
LEADFEMALE:She's gonna blow it.
SUPFEMALE:OK, Paul, we'll see you at the rally on pier five.
LEADMALE:Oh, the dolphin will really appreciate it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, isn't this exciting? Taking part in a protest.
LEADMALE:Standing up as free Americans and exercising our right to 
LEADMALE:"We're mad as hell and we're not gonna take it anymore!" I'm out of spit.
LEADMALE:Can I go now? and you're ready to quit? Blanche, we joined the Friends of Sea Mammals for a reason.
LEADFEMALE:You are so unmotivated.
OTHERMALE:Well, when I joined this Mammals with Blowholes thing, I didn't expect to be carrying picket signs on some grungy dock.
LEADFEMALE:I was hoping more for a fundraiser cocktail party with Chinese lanterns and Portuguese, no, Hispanic waiters in tight black pants.
SUPMALE:And we hire a band to play fish songs in pirate suits with muscles bulging.
SUPMALE:Your mouth is watering now, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Keep licking.
OTHERMALE:Hi, girls.
SUPMALE:You two are back early.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course we're back early.
LEADMALE:Ken called before.
SUPMALE:He says he needs to talk to Dorothy about something very important.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy! My God, Dorothy, he's gonna pop the question.
LEADMALE:Oh, I don't know that.
LEADFEMALE:Of course you do.
LEADFEMALE:What else could it be? Honey, congratulations.
SUPMALE:You're more excited than I am.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why not, Dorothy? Just think of it.
SUPFEMALE:Life with a successful attorney.
LEADMALE:The summer homes, the glamorous social circles, those impulsive little trips to Europe with rascally Romans pinching your bottom.
LEADFEMALE:You're a lucky girl, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I hate you.
LEADFEMALE:This is just crazy talk.
SUPMALE:I mean, we've only been seeing each other for three months.
LEADMALE:I've never even thought of what it would be like if I were Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Kenneth Whittingham.
OTHERFEMALE:Has a nice ring to it.
LEADFEMALE: Go get 'em, pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:Just remember, you and I come as a package.
SUPFEMALE:Ma! Hi.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart, I am so excited.
LEADFEMALE:Oh? It's just that I've come to a major decision.
LEADMALE:Oh? And it's a decision that affects both of us.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh? Sit down.
SUPMALE:Close your eyes and I'll give you a hint.
LEADFEMALE:Okey-dokey.
LEADMALE:Well? Can you guess what my decision is? You're becoming Irish? No.
LEADFEMALE:I'm becoming a clown.
OTHERFEMALE:A full-time circus clown.
SUPMALE:Ken, isn't this a bit sudden? Odd and a bit sudden? No.
OTHERMALE:I've been doing it for years at children's hospitals.
SUPFEMALE:It's been the one bright spot in my life.
LEADMALE:That and you.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I've been lawyering Can change a man.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but you're so successful.
SUPMALE:I'm also 60 and I'm miserable.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, I went to law school so I could fight for the little guy.
SUPMALE:Now I'm fighting for multinational corporations.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so frazzled, I find myself sneaking into the washroom to make balloon giraffes.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, I really need for you to understand this.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been thinking a lot lately.
LEADFEMALE:I think we're in this for the long haul.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, I think this is going to be a very serious relationship.
LEADFEMALE:I feel like a virgin.
OTHERMALE:Where do the noses go? I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:What do you say? You with me? Of course.
LEADMALE:Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:How about a celebration? I'm dining with friends from the circus.
LEADFEMALE:Join me? Might as well get my feet wet.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ken.
OTHERFEMALE:There won't be, like, a dozen tiny dogs, hopping on hind legs, wearing funny hats? Oh, I wish.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, tell me.
SUPMALE:How big a disaster was last night? It wasn't a disaster, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:It was just uncomfortable.
SUPFEMALE:I tried to find common ground, something I could talk to Ken's circus friends about.
LEADFEMALE:But it turns out the Human Cannonball doesn't do that much reading.
OTHERFEMALE:Does Ken know how you feel? He asked me how I felt, if I had a good time, and I had to tell him the truth.
OTHERMALE:I just didn't fit in with the other clowns' wives.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, I've been thinking.
SUPMALE:It might help you get your mind off this Ken thing for a while.
LEADMALE:Why don't you join us at the rally? Oh, no-- Oh, yeah, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, do.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, get out of yourself.
SUPFEMALE:It's for a noble cause.
SUPFEMALE:Or are you so self-centered that you'd rather wallow in self-pity? You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll do it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good.
SUPMALE:Rose, Dorothy's taking my place.
SUPMALE:There you are, pussycat.
SUPFEMALE:What's this news about Ken? He gave you a ring, didn't he? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Three of them.
SUPMALE:Look, Ma, I don't know how to say this, so I'll just give it to you straight out.
LEADMALE:Ken is becoming a clown.
LEADMALE:Scusi? Ma, he's tired of being a lawyer, so he's joining the circus.
OTHERMALE:What did you do to him? I didn't do anything.
LEADMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:One day the man's a lawyer, the next he's a clown.
LEADMALE:Perfectly natural.
LEADMALE:Ma, please! This is hard enough as it is.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:I just tend to get a little upset when people ruin my life! Sophia, I don't know what all the hullabaloo is about.
LEADMALE:Dating a circus clown would be a dream come true for me.
LEADFEMALE:Reach for the stars, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:No, it would.
SUPMALE:Think about it.
LEADMALE:Seeing him push those little pigs around in a baby carriage.
LEADMALE:Getting hit with a bucket of confetti any time you want.
OTHERFEMALE:And sitting up there in the stands, watching him sweep that spotlight into a little circle and thinking, "That's my man!" It's getting hot in here.
LEADMALE:Why did this happen? Just when I meet someone that I feel I have a future with, Ken does this.
SUPMALE:I know I should be more supportive, but the fact is, I'm embarrassed.
LEADMALE:Don't be ridiculous, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:You love the man for who he is.
LEADMALE:It's not like he's driving you around in a tiny car with a giant key on the back.
LEADFEMALE:Is he?  Hi, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:You are driving the Lincoln tonight? Sure.
LEADMALE:Oh, two things.
SUPFEMALE:We're doubling with Phil and Nancy tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:Two things you have to 
LEADMALE:Call them "little people.
OTHERFEMALE:" And they hate to be patted on the head.
LEADFEMALE:I found out the hard way.
LEADFEMALE:Kenny.
LEADMALE:Come here.
SUPMALE:What's with this clown business? Couldn't you be a lawyer and just hang out with clowns? I know it sounds a little odd, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Petrillo, but right now I'm just burned out on law.
LEADFEMALE:Frankly, I think I can contribute more to the world in big red shoes and a spinning bow tie and carrying a little umbrella that rains on me.
SUPFEMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy? Here.
LEADFEMALE:What did you do to him? We may not agree with the fishermen, but we want this demonstration to be peaceful.
SUPFEMALE:In the tradition of you know, the short, bald Indian fellow with the glasses and the diaper.
SUPFEMALE:You know, the one who didn't eat and won an Oscar.
LEADFEMALE:Your sign's drooping again.
LEADMALE:Now, what's the matter? It's Ken.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know which end is up.
OTHERFEMALE:He called me this morning.
LEADMALE:He wants me to travel with the circus.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid we're gonna have to call it quits.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, I'd think twice before I cut that guy off.
OTHERMALE:At your age, how many chances at the brass ring do you have left? All creatures must learn to coexist.
SUPMALE:Back where I come from, they do.
LEADMALE:That's why the brown bear and the field mouse can share their lives and live in harmony.
LEADMALE:'Course, they can't mate, or the mice would explode.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you know what I mean.
SUPMALE:I think Rose needs to work on her metaphors.
LEADMALE:I know you're down in the dumps, but I'm so glad you came.
LEADFEMALE:I really want us to make a difference today.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I am impressed.
LEADFEMALE:You have really changed your tune.
SUPMALE:It's funny how that happened.
SUPFEMALE:There I was, staying up last night, coming up with excuses to get out of this.
LEADMALE:And then it occurred to me.
LEADFEMALE:I said, "Water Lily" That's what I call myself sometimes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:"Water Lily, you've never done anything like this in your life.
SUPFEMALE:Now, this is important.
LEADFEMALE:"For the love of mother earth and the love of mother nature, commit yourself to this, Blanche Devereaux!" Isn't that exciting? Caught a rerun of Flipper on cable, did you? A particularly touching one.
SUPMALE:Where Flipper comes to the rescue.
LEADMALE:It was only after that I picked up Rose's pamphlets and read about these magnificent creatures.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's beautiful.
OTHERFEMALE:Water Lily? Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:All right, you dolphin people, get away from the gate.
LEADMALE:Watch it.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you Why can't you people see the light? Why can't you people see that there's another point of view? Get away from here.
SUPFEMALE:Take your hands off me! Let her go! Sweetheart, I came as soon as I could.
LEADFEMALE:Things got out of hand down at the dock.
SUPMALE:I'm fine.
SUPMALE:Don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:I called Ken.
SUPMALE:He's parking the car.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! Did you hear that? Did you hear that? Ken is going to save us.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody, did you hear that? We'll be out of here in no time.
LEADFEMALE:My mother called my boyfriend, a top Miami lawyer.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing to worry about.
LEADFEMALE:We are in good hands.
OTHERMALE:Oh! Dorothy, sweetheart, there you are.
LEADFEMALE:My God! Ma, you didn't tell me he was in a clown suit! Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Ken, how could you? Sophia called me at rehearsal.
SUPFEMALE:I'll change.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanted to make sure you were all right.
LEADMALE: Is counsel for the demonstrators present? Here, Your Honor.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, God.
SUPMALE:Will the clown approach the bench? Dorothy, I can do this.
LEADFEMALE:Can you do it without the nose? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell are you trying to do? I know this looks odd.
LEADFEMALE:But I am a registered member of the bar.
LEADFEMALE:I have a card here to prove it.
OTHERMALE:We're going to jail.
SUPMALE:I believe you, counselor, I believe you.
OTHERMALE:Just proceed.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Your Honor.
SUPMALE:Make it quick.
OTHERFEMALE:Your Honor, this may be my very last appearance before the bar.
OTHERFEMALE:Would you indulge me just a little? Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I have been practicing law for many, many years, and it's always amazed me how little my job actually had to do with justice.
LEADFEMALE:This stuff sounds a little better when you've got lapels and a vest.
OTHERFEMALE:Anyway, my clients are charged with trespass.
LEADMALE:But the only real crime they committed was their overzealous championing of the defenseless dolphin.
SUPMALE:The dolphin, Your Honor, that for centuries has rescued men lost at sea, guided ships back to port.
LEADMALE:No, my clients were not trespassing.
OTHERFEMALE:My clients were returning the favor.
LEADFEMALE:They simply wanted to protect some of nature's best creations from extinction.
OTHERMALE:Your Honor you have the opportunity today to make a very disillusioned lawyer happy.
LEADMALE:Please answer to a law higher than this state's, and dispense some real justice here.
LEADFEMALE:Please, let's have a little quiet here.
LEADFEMALE:That was a great speech.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Your Honor.
LEADMALE:But help me out here.
SUPMALE:How about something from a law book? OK.
SUPMALE:The fracas occurred on a seaside dock abutting navigable waters.
SUPFEMALE:I don't believe that this court has any jurisdiction.
LEADMALE:That sounds legal to me.
LEADMALE:Counselor, your last day has been a good one.
LEADFEMALE:Case dismissed.
LEADMALE:I want you two jailbirds to feel at home.
LEADMALE:Dinner's at six.
LEADFEMALE:Pass it on.
LEADMALE:Rose, honey, what is the matter? We didn't accomplish anything today, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Those tuna fishermen will be out there again tomorrow doing the same thing.
LEADMALE:I swear, I feel like a failure.
LEADFEMALE:You can't change the world in one day.
SUPMALE:But just think about what we did do.
SUPMALE:I bet we saved a few dolphin by keeping that boat off the water, and the next time you're walking along the beach and you see a school swim by, why, you can think, "Maybe I saved those gorgeous creatures from those horrible nets.
OTHERFEMALE:" You still think we were a failure? You're right.
OTHERMALE:I just wish we could save 'em all.
OTHERFEMALE:You wanna do more? Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go back down to the dock.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Sure.
LEADMALE:I know a waterfront bar where a lot of foreign fishermen hang out.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think they'd listen to me? Well, sure, they will, honey.
LEADMALE:They don't speak English and they're horny.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you going? To demonstrate.
SUPFEMALE:To celebrate.
SUPMALE:So, anything special you want to do tonight? Ken There is something.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, you know you have the most beautiful eyes? And a quarter in your ear.
SUPMALE:We really have to talk.
OTHERMALE:What's the matter? I don't know whether this is harder to say or harder to hear.
LEADFEMALE:Ken, you're a lovable man, with a lot of lovable qualities, but I don't love you.
OTHERFEMALE:It's this clown thing, isn't it? I thought that's what was bothering me.
LEADFEMALE:But, Ken, if I loved you, I'd follow you anywhere.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I see.
OTHERFEMALE:I think we were both trying too hard to make this work.
LEADFEMALE:You on your terms, me on mine.
OTHERFEMALE:But I know that I am not prepared to give up my life.
SUPMALE:And, Ken, could you give up the circus for me? Could you give up the laughter? The smiles on those children's faces? Do you know something, Dorothy? I don't think I could.
LEADMALE:Could I give up the fat lady for you? No.
LEADMALE:Could I give up the elephants for you? No.
SUPMALE:The chimps? The sword-swallower-- Ken.
SUPMALE:I think I have a grip on this.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess at our age, we do a lot of wishful thinking.
SUPMALE:We did come close, though.
OTHERFEMALE:If the circus is ever in town, I'll leave the tent flap open for you.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna miss you.
LEADMALE:
