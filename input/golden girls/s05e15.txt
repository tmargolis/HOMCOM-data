SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, do we know anybody named Cecilia? Your cousin, Ma.
SUPMALE:She only has weeks to live.
LEADMALE:Oh! Next time I'll accept the charges.
OTHERFEMALE: Hello? No.
SUPFEMALE:No, we don't have a car for sale.
OTHERFEMALE:You must have the wrong number.
LEADMALE:Is it a man or a woman? A woman, interested in a Mercedes Mm-hm.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, the car's been sold.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:Blanche, what is this all about? I have figured out the most wonderful way to meet men.
OTHERMALE:Rich, eligible men.
OTHERMALE:I put an ad in the paper saying I have a Mercedes for sale for a very low price.
LEADMALE:You don't have a Mercedes.
LEADFEMALE:But I'm renting one and pretending it's for sale.
SUPFEMALE:All day tomorrow, men are gonna be showing up here for a test drive.
OTHERFEMALE:You can tell a lot about a man by how he drives.
SUPMALE:You know, that's true.
LEADMALE:Sometimes Stan couldn't even get the key in the ignition.
LEADMALE:Hi! Hi, everybody.
LEADMALE:Hi, Miles.
LEADMALE:How was your evening? It was terrific.
OTHERMALE:We saw a marvelous production of The Glass Menagerie.
LEADFEMALE:That is one of my favorite plays.
SUPMALE:Frankly, I was a little disappointed.
LEADFEMALE:Really? When you told me you were taking me to a revival of Tennessee Williams, I was expecting something more along the lines of a sÃ©ance.
SUPMALE:Rose, I have never met anyone like you.
OTHERMALE:Check the cornfield on Hee Haw.
LEADMALE:Ma, why don't we go, so that Rose and Miles can be alone? Why? We were here first.
OTHERMALE:Ma, isn't it time for your medication? Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:I thought my buzz was wearing off.
OTHERMALE:I really did have a good time tonight.
OTHERMALE:And don't forget, I'm taking you out tomorrow for your birthday
LEADFEMALE:my treat.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no! Rose, I forgot to tell you.
SUPMALE:My daughter Caroline is flying in for my birthday.
SUPMALE:Maybe we could all go out to lunch.
LEADMALE:I'm very anxious for you two to get together.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you two come here for lunch? I'll cook something special.
OTHERFEMALE:That's a great idea.
SUPMALE:I loved what you made the last time.
LEADMALE:What was it called
LEADFEMALE:gerkinflunken? Oh, no, that was my uncle.
SUPMALE:The owner of St.
LEADMALE:Olaf's most famous haberdashery.
LEADFEMALE:He came up with the slogan, "You don't have to be Amish to look Amish.
OTHERFEMALE:" Gosh, I wish I could afford something pretty like this for my potential car buyers, but I'm having those end-of-the-month money problems.
LEADFEMALE:Looking for a loan? You've come to the right place.
LEADMALE:Why, Sophia! How'd you get your hands on that kind of money? I'm a graverobber.
SUPMALE:What's it to you? Morning, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, Ma.
SUPMALE:Sleep well? No.
LEADFEMALE:I had that recurring nightmare
LEADMALE:the one where I'm in bed with Warren Beatty and he says, "Sorry, this is too sick even for me.
LEADFEMALE:" Do we have the ingredients for kerflugenglugen? Come on, Rose, get with it.
LEADMALE:Do what the rest of us do
LEADMALE:buy frozen kerflugenglugen.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I could never serve store-bought candied herring.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, I have my own special recipe.
LEADMALE:I use red-hots for the eyes.
LEADMALE:Kill her! Kill her now!  I'll get it.
OTHERMALE:Hello? Well, you are aware that it's a two-seater? It's not much of a family car.
LEADFEMALE:Oh?! How long have you and your wife been practically separated? Well, you might as well come over for a look.
SUPMALE:How about, say, 12:20? Oh, good.
LEADMALE:Well, I can't wait for you to get your hands on it either! Goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:You're not having company? I want everything to go smoothly for Miles and Caroline.
SUPMALE:It's a big step, meeting a man's family.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:Men will be over, but they'll be in and out.
SUPFEMALE:Don't say it, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:I have to.
OTHERMALE:At my age, when you don't say it, it can back up on you and come out some other way.
LEADMALE:My first appointment's here, right on time.
LEADFEMALE:I've been out there watching him.
OTHERMALE:He's been looking at the car and smiling.
LEADMALE:I feel just like a fisherman with a new lure.
SUPFEMALE:You catch 'em, you clean 'em! Blanche, aren't you embarrassed, going through all this subterfuge to get a man? A man? I'm planning on getting a six-month supply!  Oh, hi.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche? James.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm here about the car.
LEADFEMALE:Miles? No, honey, it's James.
LEADMALE:You stay right there and I'll get the keys.
OTHERMALE:How much mileage has she got on her? Let's just say she's been around the block.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go, James.
LEADMALE:Let's put the pedal to the metal.
LEADMALE:I can't believe anything that beautiful is so cheap.
LEADMALE:I'm cramping up! Miles? No, it wasn't Miles.
LEADMALE:We'll let you know when he gets here.
SUPMALE:Maybe we need a signal.
SUPMALE:How about this
LEADFEMALE:I yell, "Hey, Rose, Miles is here"? Got it.
SUPMALE: Miles? Rose! You might have forgotten the signal.
LEADMALE:I know I did.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Delivery for a Sophia Petrillo.
LEADMALE:Here's a president you've never seen.
LEADFEMALE:Look what I got, Dorothy
SUPMALE:a surprise for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look at these watches! They must have cost you a fortune.
LEADFEMALE:They did.
LEADMALE:Where'd you get the money? Is that what you say to someone who bought you a gift? Ma, I asked you a question.
LEADFEMALE:I never told you this, Dorothy, but I'm a special friend of Phil Rizzuto.
LEADFEMALE: Hi, ladies.
SUPMALE:Hello, Miles.
LEADMALE:I want you to meet my daughter Caroline.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy.
SUPMALE:It's so nice to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:This is Sophia.
LEADMALE:Rose, Miles is here! Rose, Miles is here! Who? Hello, Rose! Miles? Rose, this is Caroline.
LEADFEMALE:Caroline, Rose Nylund.
SUPFEMALE:How do you do? I am so glad to finally meet you.
OTHERMALE:Lunch is all set up out on the lanai.
SUPMALE:Your father says you're a classical musician.
SUPMALE:What do you play? The English horn.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't know horns had nationalities.
SUPMALE:But I guess it makes sense.
LEADMALE:If jumping beans can be Mexican and fire drills can be Chinese and flies can be Spanish  Hi, I'm here about the car.
LEADMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:Have a seat.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:How're you doing? Blanche is out on a test drive.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche said I was gonna be the first.
SUPMALE:She's been using that line for 40 years.
LEADFEMALE:That was fun, James.
SUPMALE:We ought to get together again sometime.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to talk to you about buying the car.
LEADMALE:Not now.
OTHERMALE:I'll get backed up on my appointments.
LEADFEMALE:Are you Thomas? I am, here for my test drive.
LEADMALE:You don't even have to show him the car.
SUPFEMALE:I'll write you a check.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:At this price, I know I want the car.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I'm writing out a $5,000 deposit now.
SUPMALE:No, I can't do that.
LEADFEMALE:The banks are closed.
SUPFEMALE:I can't be sure it's any good.
OTHERMALE:You've got an honest face.
LEADMALE:I'll cash that check right here.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, can I see you in the kitchen? I've got no secrets from these people.
LEADFEMALE:Shady Pines, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Right behind you.
LEADFEMALE:I think you should take my check Ma, I wanna know, where did you get the money? The government has been kinder and gentler by sending me more social security checks than they used to.
LEADFEMALE:The computer made a mistake.
SUPMALE:Ma, that money doesn't belong to you.
LEADMALE:How much are we talking about? Enough to have you rubbed out if you rat on me.
LEADMALE:Ma! So far, 170 grand.
LEADMALE:But I haven't checked today's mail.
SUPFEMALE:It was awfully sweet of you to go to all this trouble, Rose.
LEADMALE:This is, uh delicious.
LEADFEMALE:Mm, even the eyes.
SUPMALE:Have you tried those eyes?  Oh, no! You ate the tail before we had a chance to make a wish.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't help myself
SUPMALE:it was all so delicious.
LEADMALE:You certainly know the way to a man's heart.
SUPMALE:I'll just take these in.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll help you.
SUPFEMALE:Who wants birthday cake? What's in it? It's a secret.
LEADMALE:And in some countries, a vaccine.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, I'll give you $20,000 and free root canal work.
SUPFEMALE:You're a dentist! I'll tell you what, I'll give you $25,000 and free root canal work.
LEADFEMALE:You're a dentist, too! No, but I really want this car.
LEADMALE:Mail call! Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
LEADFEMALE:See ya.
SUPFEMALE:These are all checks from the government? No, there's also an application for a gold card.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, word gets around fast! I am so happy I finally got the chance to meet you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm happy, too.
LEADMALE:Rose I've a feeling you and I are gonna be the best of friends.
LEADMALE:There's something we need to talk about.
SUPMALE:It's about you and Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:I know it seems like a crazy match
LEADMALE:a college professor and a farmer's daughter
LEADFEMALE:but somehow what we have together seems to work.
LEADMALE:Rose, it's only been a year since my mother died.
LEADMALE:Daddy's still very vulnerable at this point.
OTHERFEMALE:I can understand why he reached out for you
LEADMALE:you're very warm and very giving.
OTHERFEMALE:But he needs time.
SUPMALE:So, please, if you really care for my father, the best thing you can do is stay away from him.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God, Rose! Now I've got three excited men out there
OTHERFEMALE:and for the first time in my life it seems like too many.
LEADMALE:Your 1:30 appointment just got here, and I think he's interested.
LEADFEMALE:Not another one! What am I gonna do? Didn't you think this thing through? Didn't you think they'd want to buy the car? No! I assumed once they saw me, they'd forget all about the car.
LEADMALE:Well, I'd better do something to get their minds off that car.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't I offer 'em some cake? That's Miles' birthday cake.
LEADFEMALE:He'll have other birthdays.
LEADMALE:But not with me.
OTHERFEMALE:Why? What's wrong? Caroline told me to stay away from Miles 'cause it's only a year since his wife died.
SUPMALE:Oh, Rose, that's terrible.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't give her any cake.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, those are Caroline's feelings, not Miles'
LEADFEMALE:otherwise, why would he be here? I was trying so hard to impress her.
LEADFEMALE:I remember when we had to impress a man's parents, not his children.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, Mother Devereaux was dead set against me marrying George.
SUPFEMALE:She wanted her little boy to marry a virgin.
LEADFEMALE:Hm! How did she know you weren't? Maybe it was all those "Honk if you've had Blanche" bumper stickers.
SUPMALE:Oh!  I wish I knew what to do.
LEADFEMALE:I could settle that thing with Miles in one minute.
LEADMALE:I can handle men one at a time.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, could you really do something? Sure I could.
SUPMALE:If Dorothy will take care of that mess out in the living room.
LEADFEMALE:Now, just a minute.
SUPFEMALE:I have my own problems.
LEADFEMALE:I'm dealing with a mother who stole money from the government.
SUPMALE:Come on! It's not like I'm an elected official.
SUPFEMALE:Turn her in, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:But first, go out there and take care of those men.
SUPFEMALE:I have to take care of my mother.
SUPMALE:I can't take care of both Miles and the men.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, please do this for Blanche.
SUPMALE:For me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, all right.
SUPMALE:I don't want my plan to go to waste.
OTHERMALE:I still intend to date James and Thomas, so let them down easy.
LEADFEMALE:Frank and Eddie, flush 'em.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Rose, don't be so upset.
LEADMALE:Have you seen the way Miles looks when you tell those St.
OTHERMALE:Olaf stories? He looks like he's listening.
SUPMALE:There you go!  Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, did you happen to see a little old lady go by? The one who said, "What are you staring at? I can buy you and sell you"? Went that way.
LEADMALE: Ma? Now, look, Ma, we have to talk about the money.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, pussycat.
SUPFEMALE:Your sister and brother don't have to know anything about this.
LEADMALE:I want you to promise that you'll send this money back to the government.
LEADFEMALE:They're not good with money
LEADFEMALE:they can't handle it.
OTHERFEMALE:They spent $400 for a toilet seat! You know, Ma, I'm really surprised at you.
LEADMALE:When I was a little girl, you told me how much it meant to you when you came here to America for the first time.
OTHERMALE:Do you remember what you thought of when you first saw the Statue of Liberty holding up her torch of freedom? I was amazed.
OTHERFEMALE:You see? I was amazed that women in this country shaved under their arms.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you told me how much America meant to you, how wonderful America was, how nice it is to be in a country that doesn't care about soccer.
OTHERFEMALE:That money belongs to America.
LEADMALE:Ma, you have America's money and you have to give it back.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, please You taught me to love this country.
SUPFEMALE:You were the first one to make me feel proud of being an American.
LEADFEMALE:You were the first one who put an American flag in my hand.
LEADMALE:Ma, why don't you take a moment and think what America has given you? Besides this 170 grand? All right.
LEADMALE:All right, all right, I'll send it back.
SUPMALE:All of it? Yes, Ma, all of it.
LEADFEMALE:OK, OK.
LEADMALE:I just hope they want it back after an 83-year-old woman rolled around in it naked.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, how was lunch? I don't know how the woman does it.
OTHERMALE:The herring was not only delicious, but it looked happy!  Well, Caroline.
LEADFEMALE:Did you tell your daddy about your little talk with Rose? Not yet.
OTHERFEMALE:What did I miss? I think he has a right to know.
OTHERMALE:I, uh told Rose the truth, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:It's too soon for you to have a relationship.
LEADFEMALE:You what?! Now wait.
SUPFEMALE:Could I say something? You think your daddy has become involved too soon after your poor mother's demise, but, honey, a year is more than respectable.
LEADMALE:Why, I've had men call me when their wives were in intensive care.
SUPMALE:Granted, these men were not pillars of the community.
LEADMALE:Well, he is not ready.
OTHERMALE:Caroline! Caroline, your mother and I were married for 43 years.
LEADMALE:They were wonderful years.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't think I'd find someone I'd care about again, but this happens when it happens
SUPMALE:I've got a second chance.
SUPMALE:I think it would be nice if you'd be happy for me.
SUPFEMALE:How could he do this? He has needs, honey.
LEADMALE:All men have needs.
LEADFEMALE:And there are women out there who will to stoop to any means to prey on those needs
LEADFEMALE:including false advertising.
LEADFEMALE:I know, 'cause I've met 'em.
LEADFEMALE:You just thank your lucky stars Rose Nylund is not one of those women.
LEADFEMALE:I never looked at it that way.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, after you get to know Rose, why, you'll you'll Oh, why spoil the surprise?  Gentlemen, please! You don't seem to understand what I'm trying to tell you
SUPMALE:the car is not for sale! Why not? It's haunted.
LEADFEMALE:Haunted? What? The car is haunted.
LEADMALE:I should know, I rode in it.
LEADMALE:You look OK.
LEADFEMALE:I'm 27 years old.
LEADMALE:We're not getting anywhere.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche wants James and Thomas.
LEADFEMALE:I'll try to save them.
LEADMALE:You go over there with Frick and Frack and try to ditch 'em.
LEADMALE:You want me to offend them? Pretend they're family.
OTHERMALE:Look, everybody named after an apostle, come with me.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, there was no Eddie.
LEADFEMALE:Have you guys ever heard of Totally Hidden Video? Underneath this gray wig is comedian Kaye Ballard.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for being on our show.
OTHERFEMALE:So that's the story.
OTHERFEMALE:The car is not available, but Blanche Devereaux is.
LEADMALE:I can't believe that I've been hustled! Boy, if I wasn't a teacher and accustomed to abuse, I'd leave too! Really? You know, I'm a teacher myself.
SUPMALE:No kidding? Say, um why don't you tell me about this automobile thing again? Say tonight, over dinner? Oh, now, Blanche Devereaux is a very charming, attractive woman.
SUPFEMALE:She is.
LEADFEMALE:Shall I pick you up around 7:30? I feel terrible about this.
LEADFEMALE:Let's say 8:00.
OTHERFEMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Take her someplace decent.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Rose, I made it perfectly clear to Caroline how I feel about you.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe Caroline is right.
LEADMALE:Your wife died such a little while ago.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I am taking advantage of your vulnerability.
SUPMALE:Rose, you're a smart woman.
SUPMALE:Oh, you are vulnerable! Of course I am.
SUPMALE:I'm drawn to your beauty, your charm, your unique brand of wisdom.
LEADFEMALE:What about Caroline? Oh! Caroline doesn't know everything.
LEADFEMALE:You should see the cardigan she got me for my birthday.
LEADFEMALE:She can't even pick out a sweater for me, much less a whole person.
LEADFEMALE:I wish she felt better about us.
LEADMALE:She's just gonna have to get used to us.
LEADMALE:I'm staying around.
LEADFEMALE:If you'll let me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'll let you.
LEADFEMALE:Rose Not in the kitchen
LEADFEMALE:you'll dry out the cheese! See you tonight, Rose.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, ladies.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye, Miles.
LEADFEMALE:You take care of her.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I can't thank you enough.
LEADMALE:You're welcome.
SUPFEMALE:Let's get to the important stuff
LEADFEMALE:who am I going out with tonight? Well, uh James says he never wants to see you again.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh the truth is, I'm going out with Thomas tonight.
SUPMALE:You're not upset, are you, Blanche? Well, no, I'm not upset.
OTHERFEMALE:It serves me right.
LEADMALE:Hey, matter of fact, take the Mercedes.
LEADFEMALE:Have a good time.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, that's awfully sweet of you.
OTHERFEMALE:You got this coming.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:I would like to report a stolen Mercedes.
OTHERMALE:
