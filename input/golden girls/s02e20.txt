LEADMALE:You scared me to death.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing? Getting a close-up of your face.
LEADFEMALE:I'm too close.
SUPMALE:Did you have a poppy-seed bagel for breakfast? Put that down.
OTHERMALE:What do you think you're doing? Making a video for my class at the junior college.
SUPFEMALE:Really? It sounds like fun.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad you think so.
LEADMALE:I want you as one of the stars.
LEADMALE:I don't think so.
LEADMALE:I'm uncomfortable in front of a camera.
SUPMALE:Besides, I always come out looking like Fess Parker.
LEADMALE:This is a documentary.
LEADFEMALE:It's OK if you're not good-Iooking.
LEADMALE:Rose, stop trying to appeal to my ego.
OTHERFEMALE:The answer is no.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, how would you like to star in my video? Are there any nude love scenes? No.
LEADMALE:If it's integral to the plot, I'm happy to do it.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, Sophia wants to be in my video.
LEADMALE:Why won't you? Dorothy's always been camera-shy.
OTHERFEMALE:You'd be, if you looked like Fess Parker in heels.
SUPMALE:Blanche, how do you feel about performing in front of a video camera? It's OK as long as you've had at least three dates.
LEADMALE:It's for my video class.
LEADFEMALE:My final project is A Day In The Life Of My Roommates.
LEADMALE:Sure, honey, that sounds like fun.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:You're a real friend.
LEADFEMALE:You and Sophia.
LEADMALE:I'll just shoot around Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Alright, alright, Rose, I'll do it.
SUPFEMALE:But just don't shoot from too low.
SUPFEMALE:Stan used to do that in our home movies and I always looked like someone from another planet.
LEADMALE:She looked like Fess Parker from another planet.
LEADFEMALE:I just got an invitation to the reunion of my college sorority, the Alpha Gams.
LEADFEMALE:I belonged to a sorority when I was in college, the Alpha Yams.
SUPFEMALE:It was an agricultural college.
SUPMALE:I cannot wait to see my sorority sisters.
LEADFEMALE:Scarlett and Melanie and all the rest of the girls.
SUPMALE:It's gonna be exactly like old times.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe not just exactly.
OTHERMALE:The other girls will have grown wrinkled and saggy through the years, while I have remained unbelievably devastating.
LEADFEMALE:I cannot wait to go back there and rub their noses in it.
LEADFEMALE:It's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:You make lifelong bonds when you join a sorority.
LEADFEMALE:I never belonged to one.
SUPMALE:I was blackballed.
SUPFEMALE:I think that is so cruel.
LEADFEMALE:The Alpha Yams didn't have blackballing.
OTHERMALE:We believed that any girl who wanted to help her community and foster a feeling of sisterhood
LEADMALE:should be allowed to join.
LEADFEMALE:Very commendable.
SUPFEMALE:As long as she could castrate a sheep.
SUPMALE:There was a service organisation in Sicily with similar membership requirements.
SUPMALE:Except that instead of a sheep, it usually involved a mayor from a neighbouring town.
SUPMALE:Ma.
SUPMALE:Some of Italy's finest sopranos were former mayors.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, you're supposed to pretend I'm not here.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I'm sorry, Rose, but ever since you filmed me naked doing a pedicure, I've become slightly aware of your presence.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, my child.
LEADMALE:Sunshine of my life.
SUPMALE:You got that in a close-up, Rose? Why are you dressed like someone who just escaped from It's A Small World? Come, my darling daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Mother has made you your favourite breakfast.
OTHERFEMALE:Lasagne in meat sauce? Doesn't it look delicious? And think, for just $5.
LEADMALE:95, the recipe can be yours.
OTHERMALE:Hold it.
SUPMALE:Stop.
SUPMALE:Stop the camera.
LEADFEMALE:Cut.
LEADMALE:The director's the one who says when to cut.
SUPMALE:Unless the actor is big and mad.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, what is going on? Dorothy, this could be my big chance.
OTHERFEMALE:With the exposure I get, I could hawk my recipes around the country.
LEADFEMALE:That's ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:If you wanna move your product, you gotta have exposure.
OTHERMALE:All the great Italian chefs had it.
LEADFEMALE:Mamma Celeste, Chef Boyardee and Chef Balducci.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't remember Chef Balducci.
SUPMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:He didn't have television exposure, that was indecent exposure.
SUPFEMALE:He should've stuffed cannelloni in the traditional manner.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, girls.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing here? I thought the reunion wasn't over till tomorrow.
LEADMALE:No, it isn't.
SUPMALE:I just decided I'd come home early.
SUPMALE:Is there something wrong? No, nothing.
OTHERMALE:Whatever gave you that idea? As long as nothing's bothering you.
SUPMALE:Should we defrost a loin of pork so you can scoop up the sauce? I can't help it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm so upset.
SUPFEMALE:Seeing my sorority sisters was just dreadful.
SUPMALE:Why? It was as if time had stood still for 30 years.
LEADMALE:Every woman looked wonderful.
LEADMALE:They'd hardly aged at all.
SUPMALE:I saw a movie like that once.
LEADFEMALE:All the women were sucked up into flying saucers.
SUPFEMALE:And mechanical doubles were sent back to earth to take their place.
SUPMALE:Did any of them mention a leader named Zardos? Rose, I'm saying they had all had face-lifts and they looked absolutely gorgeous.
LEADMALE:It was the most disgusting spectacle I've ever witnessed in my life.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Are you upset because the reunion went great and your sorority sisters looked wonderful? Of course not.
SUPMALE:That would be childish.
SUPMALE:I'm upset because I wasn't the centre of attention and nobody said I was the prettiest.
LEADMALE:Come on now, Blanche.
SUPMALE:What difference does it make? Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:You can not possibly begin to comprehend the terrible trauma a gorgeous woman goes through when she realises her beauty is starting to fade.
SUPFEMALE:And who do you see when you look at me? Joe Pepitone? All my life my beauty has outshone every other woman's.
SUPMALE:But no more.
LEADFEMALE:Now people are cuter than me, my life is over.
SUPMALE:If you feel like that about it, you can get a face-lift, too.
LEADFEMALE:I can't.
SUPMALE:Surgery scares me to death.
LEADMALE:That's out of the question.
LEADMALE:You'll just have to grow old along with the rest of us.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't go on if I looked like you two.
SUPFEMALE:You know, she had me in her corner right up until the end.
LEADMALE:Hi, Ma.
LEADMALE:Want some tea?
OTHERFEMALE:Nah, I'm trying to cut back.
OTHERFEMALE:Tea stains my dentures.
LEADFEMALE:I had to soak them in Ajax.
SUPFEMALE:They're white, but my mouth feels like somebody should rinse their socks in it.
LEADFEMALE:Glass of milk?
OTHERMALE:Nah, it upsets my stomach.
LEADFEMALE:Orange juice?
OTHERMALE:Too acidic.
LEADFEMALE:Can I get you anything?
LEADMALE:Cup of tea would be nice.
LEADMALE:The rough-cut of my documentary is done for you to see.
SUPMALE:Where's Blanche? Where she's been for the past two days.
LEADMALE:Locked in her room crying.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe she's still upset because her classmates look better than she does.
SUPMALE:I can.
LEADFEMALE:I tell you, her looks have always been very important to Blanche.
SUPMALE:Blanche is a vain person and vanity is a terrible thing.
SUPMALE:I should know.
OTHERFEMALE:I was vain myself.
LEADFEMALE:You, Sophia? You think I was born with white hair and a Play-Doh butt? When I was a teenager, I was gorgeous.
LEADFEMALE:Eyes as deep and black as ripe olives.
SUPFEMALE:Skin as smooth and creamy as fresh butter.
LEADFEMALE:Hair flaming red like a rich marinara sauce.
SUPMALE:Ma, that's not you, that's your lasagne recipe.
LEADMALE:Shut up.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, I was the most gorgeous girl in the village and I had my pick of the town's most eligible goat farmers.
LEADMALE:Until Anna Maria Alonso Paladino, known to her friends as Muffin, moved to our village.
LEADMALE:Suddenly, all the men, who were always fighting over who would keep the footprints I left in the mud, were after Muffin.
LEADFEMALE:So, I decided Wait, just a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:They would fight over who kept the footprints you left in the mud? It was a poor village, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:What did you want them to collect, Faberg√© eggs? I was too vain to be the second-most beautiful girl in the village.
LEADMALE:So, I went to Muffin and I told her how I felt.
SUPFEMALE:That was when I found out that beautiful girl was even more beautiful inside.
LEADFEMALE:She offered to move to the neighbouring village.
SUPMALE:And you felt guilty 'cause you'd been vain.
LEADMALE:Hell, no.
LEADMALE:I helped her pack.
LEADMALE:But it all backfired in my face because the next day, all the good-Iooking men followed her.
LEADMALE:That's how I ended up with your father.
LEADMALE:Boy, talk about learning a lesson the hard way.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi, girls.
LEADMALE:How are you feeling?
OTHERMALE:Much better.
SUPFEMALE:I've decided I've been acting foolish about this whole thing.
SUPMALE:I guess I still look pretty good.
SUPFEMALE:Pretty good? You look terrific.
LEADMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:I also decided to be a bit more modest.
OTHERMALE:But in this case that's lying, which is worse.
SUPMALE:So, you're right.
SUPMALE:I do look terrific.
LEADFEMALE:Thank goodness that's over with.
SUPMALE:I'm dying for your opinion on my movie.
LEADFEMALE:It's ready.
SUPMALE:I didn't do the soundtrack yet, but I got the editing done.
LEADMALE:Remember, it'd be better with a bigger TV.
OTHERFEMALE:We know.
LEADMALE:It'd be better with music.
OTHERFEMALE:We understand.
LEADFEMALE:And it'd be better It would be better with Shelley Hack.
LEADMALE:Turn it on.
LEADFEMALE:Here goes.
SUPMALE:That's Sophia walking into the kitchen.
LEADMALE:I didn't know Fess Parker was in this picture.
LEADMALE:Ma, what are you doing?
SUPFEMALE:Mugging for the camera.
SUPMALE:You're mugging me.
LEADFEMALE:You're stealing money from my pocket.
LEADMALE:I'm seeing if you have change for the bus.
LEADMALE:Now I'm stealing.
LEADFEMALE:My God.
LEADMALE:Is that me? I look awful.
SUPFEMALE:No, I was out of focus.
SUPMALE:You always are.
LEADFEMALE:No, I look old.
LEADFEMALE:I look decrepit.
SUPMALE:I look ancient.
LEADMALE:I look shrivelled up and wrinkled like a prune.
SUPFEMALE:Could be worse.
LEADFEMALE:She could look like Fess Parker.
SUPFEMALE:Turn that thing off right now.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche.
SUPMALE:Blanche, Blanche, now calm down.
SUPMALE:I'm just as calm as can be.
LEADMALE:And you know why? Because my worst suspicions have just been confirmed.
SUPMALE:My good looks are fading.
LEADFEMALE:The camera does not lie.
OTHERMALE:That leaves me with only one choice.
SUPFEMALE:I am gonna be perfect.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna be gorgeous.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna have my tummy tucked and my butt firmed and my breasts raised and my face lifted.
SUPMALE:It's a shame to do all that and keep that hairdo.
LEADMALE:Here, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think of Cheryl Tiegs' nose? Very nice.
SUPMALE:Kinda small.
OTHERMALE:Grandpa Nylund always said, "The air is free.
LEADFEMALE:Have a big honker and suck up as much as you can.
SUPMALE:" Course, he looked like he'd caught a boomerang in his face.
SUPMALE:I like this.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna get it.
LEADFEMALE:What are you getting? I'm picking out the kind of face to show the plastic surgeon.
SUPMALE:I wanna get Linda Evans's eyes and Lena Horne's cheekbones and Cheryl Tiegs' nose and Carol Burnett's chin.
LEADFEMALE:You can get that chin through a catalogue.
LEADMALE:If you put the pieces together, you see what the new me's gonna look like.
OTHERFEMALE:See, there.
SUPFEMALE:What do you think? Why is everyone looking at a picture of Gavin MacLeod? No, this is a collage of the things I'm having done to my face.
OTHERFEMALE:You're going ahead with the surgery? I am.
LEADMALE:I'm looking forward to it.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe in it.
LEADFEMALE:It's unnatural.
OTHERFEMALE:This from a woman who slept with a pig until she was 11.
LEADFEMALE:If it makes you feel better to look better, there's nothing wrong with it.
SUPMALE:I guess that looking good isn't important to me.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about? You wear make-up, have your nails done, colour your hair.
LEADMALE:This is my hair's natural colour.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and John Madden is a finicky eater.
LEADMALE:You might have a point.
LEADMALE:But plastic surgery is so drastic.
LEADMALE:I'd be scared.
SUPMALE:Believe me, honey, there is nothing to it.
LEADFEMALE:It's not that bad.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, have you had plastic surgery? I don't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:What did you have done?
SUPFEMALE:My eyes.
SUPMALE:Worth every penny.
SUPMALE:Please, you spent $1,500, you go out on two dates a year.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't do it for anybody else.
OTHERFEMALE:I did it for me.
LEADFEMALE:Most people didn't know I'd had surgery.
SUPMALE:But I knew.
LEADMALE:It made me feel better about myself.
OTHERFEMALE:You were lucky.
LEADFEMALE:It doesn't always work out that well.
LEADMALE:It sure didn't for Olga Fetchik.
LEADMALE:Just a minute, Rose.
SUPMALE:Somebody give me a hand signal when she's finished.
LEADMALE:Olga Fetchik was our town beautician.
OTHERMALE:And one of God's most unattractive creations since the aardvark.
LEADMALE:Anyway, over the years, Olga had been secretly squirreling away money for plastic surgery.
OTHERMALE:One day she left without telling anyone, had the surgery and didn't return for months.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody could believe their eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Olga Fetchik had turned into a stunning beauty.
SUPFEMALE:Every man in town wanted her.
LEADFEMALE:She ended up marrying St.
SUPFEMALE:Olaf's most handsome and eligible bachelor, dance instructor Adolph Step.
SUPMALE:The two of them moved back to Norway, decided to get into show business, and became the internationally renowned Scandinavian dance team of Step and Fetchik.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, not that I care, but since you've already gone to so much trouble, just how did having plastic surgery ruin Olga's life? It didn't ruin her life, it almost ruined St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf.
LEADFEMALE:After she left, the town didn't have a professional beautician for years.
OTHERMALE:Women started giving each other home perms.
LEADFEMALE:Soon, everybody looked like Art Garfunkel.
LEADFEMALE:Husbands stopped sleeping with their wives, the population started to go down.
LEADFEMALE:The town would have gone under if Oslo's most famous hairstylist, Vidal Sassbogadotter hadn't relocated his shop in St.
SUPMALE:Olaf because of our more favourable tax laws.
LEADMALE:Now, you see why I don't like plastic surgery? What did you do that for? Why should we be alone in pain? You were saying, Rose? Mrs Devereaux, come in, please.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Dr Taylor.
LEADFEMALE:Pleased to meet you.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go over your form.
LEADMALE:Fine.
OTHERMALE:Shall I disrobe here or do you have an examining room? Your medical form that you filled out in the waiting room.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry.
OTHERMALE:You are proposing some very extensive surgery here.
LEADMALE:Eyes, nose, stomach And breasts.
SUPMALE:These are from a magazine.
SUPMALE:What do you think? Very nice.
OTHERFEMALE:The angle's a little steep for my personal tastes.
LEADFEMALE:But they certainly do make a statement.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, they do, they say "big".
LEADFEMALE:That's exactly what I want.
LEADFEMALE:It just so happens that breasts are my specialty.
LEADMALE:You have that in common with a linebacker on the Miami Dolphins.
OTHERFEMALE:As a matter of fact, I've worked on a few celebrities.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me, what celebrities have you done? Now, I can't tell you that.
SUPMALE:That would be unethical.
SUPFEMALE:Let's just say that some of my handiwork is prominently featured on NBC's Thursday night line-up.
LEADFEMALE:Now, Mrs Devereaux
SUPMALE:Call me Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:We're talking about tightening my behind and pumping up my bosoms.
SUPFEMALE:We can be on a first-name basis.
SUPFEMALE:Alright, Blanche.
SUPMALE:But I think there's some things that you don't understand.
OTHERFEMALE:There are good reasons for having this kind of work done.
SUPFEMALE:But there are also bad ones.
LEADMALE:Plastic surgery will only improve your general appearance.
LEADMALE:It won't make you perfect.
OTHERMALE:And, as with any surgery, there are risks involved.
LEADFEMALE:There are absolutely no guarantees, no miracles.
LEADFEMALE:Dr Taylor, you are not going to dissuade me from having this surgery.
LEADMALE:You see, all my life, my physical beauty has served as a source of inspiration to me.
LEADMALE:And to countless others.
LEADFEMALE:But now that beauty seems to be fading and I'm scared.
LEADFEMALE:I've never had to do without it and I don't know if I can.
LEADFEMALE:I don't mind growing older, as long as I look the same.
LEADMALE:There's no doubt.
SUPFEMALE:I don't care about the risks.
OTHERMALE:I definitely intend to have this surgery.
LEADMALE:Blanche, honey.
LEADMALE:How are you? You're probably uncomfortable now, but in a few days you'll feel fine.
LEADMALE:Can we get you anything? You've got yourself one hell of a lawsuit there, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Was this a last-minute decision? We're very sorry, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Nurse, do you know what happened to Mrs Devereaux? She cancelled her surgery.
LEADFEMALE:She checked out this morning.
SUPMALE:Sorry for the inconvenience, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Diodoro.
SUPMALE:It's time for your medication.
LEADMALE:Diodoro? Funny, he didn't look Italian.
LEADFEMALE:She's not out there.
SUPFEMALE:She isn't in her bedroom.
SUPFEMALE:There's no one in the kitchen now, but the coffee's still warm.
SUPMALE:Because we were drinking it less than an hour ago.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, Miss Marple, I'm new at this.
OTHERMALE:Where have you been?
LEADMALE:You had us worried sick.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, I thought I'd get home before you left.
LEADFEMALE:I would have, if I hadn't seen this stunning dress in a store and realised how it would accentuate the soft, voluptuous curves of my gorgeous body.
OTHERMALE:Gorgeous body? Yesterday it was a bag of russet potatoes with earrings.
OTHERFEMALE:That depends on how you look at it.
LEADFEMALE:And Dr Gordon Taylor obviously looked at it with desire in his eyes.
LEADMALE:He asked me out on Friday night.
LEADMALE:So you cancelled the surgery for a date? It wasn't any old date.
SUPMALE:It was with a plastic surgeon.
SUPMALE:Beauty is his stock in trade.
SUPFEMALE:He can create any face, any body he wants.
SUPFEMALE:What he wanted was mine.
LEADMALE:That got me to thinking.
LEADFEMALE:All my life I have had a unique charm that just kind of flowed naturally.
SUPFEMALE:If I tampered with that, I could risk losing forever that special magic that is Blanche Devereaux.
SUPFEMALE:That was a risk I was not willing to take.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why you decided not to have surgery.
SUPFEMALE:No, I landed myself a doctor, so he can pay for it.
LEADMALE:Besides, I can live with the lines and wrinkles and sagging, as long as I have you three to grow old with.
SUPFEMALE:What a lovely thing to say.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Specially since no matter how old we get, I'll always be the youngest, and the prettiest and by far the most desirable.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, once again she had me in her corner right up until the end.
OTHERFEMALE:
