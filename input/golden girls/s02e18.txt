LEADMALE:
OTHERMALE:Sophia, isn't that obscene? No.
LEADFEMALE:They mean, "good health," "have a nice day" and "would you like to squeeze my concertina?" You spent the afternoon together.
LEADMALE:He didn't ask you out? What did you do wrong?
LEADFEMALE:Who didn't ask you out?
LEADMALE:You got a phone book? Frank Leahy, the teacher I've been working with on the youth fair.
LEADMALE:Two weeks and he hasn't asked her out yet.
LEADMALE:I don't know him know him.
SUPMALE:We have spent exactly two Saturday mornings building display booths and painting signs.
LEADMALE:We're hardly close.
LEADMALE:You could be, if you'd ask him out.
SUPMALE:He's too shy to ask you.
OTHERMALE:Maybe he just doesn't like her.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, Rose.
SUPMALE:Incidentally, you look fat.
OTHERMALE:The time for subtlety has passed.
LEADMALE:If you want this man, ask him out.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I feel so awkward asking a man out on a date.
LEADFEMALE:You could invite him here to dinner, wouldn't seem as pushy.
LEADMALE:Great idea, then we can all check him out.
LEADMALE:I don't think I can do it.
LEADMALE:Of course you can.
LEADMALE:You be Frank.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be you.
LEADFEMALE:OK? Why, Frank, you know I've been thinking, this is our third Saturday and I don't even know what you like to eat.
SUPMALE:Come over for dinner this Saturday night and let me find out what whets your appetite.
LEADFEMALE:And what are you serving for dessert, Blanche, penicillin? I'll do it my own way.
SUPFEMALE:If you do, you'd better use Jane Fonda's body, otherwise, it'll be just four of us for dinner.
LEADMALE:Frank Frank, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I was just going to say that the sign seemed a little high on one side.
LEADFEMALE:How about a coffee break?
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:When you get the chance, would you fix that sign? Seems a little high on one side.
LEADMALE:Yeah, sure, Frank.
LEADFEMALE:I notice a lot of your students call you "Frank.
SUPFEMALE:"
LEADFEMALE:You don't approve?
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:On the contrary.
LEADMALE:Anything other than "Yo, Teach.
LEADFEMALE:" Is an educational breakthrough.
SUPFEMALE:Formal titles can be very intimidating.
OTHERMALE:This way, I'm just one of the guys.
LEADFEMALE:You think a lot of these kids.
LEADFEMALE:So do you.
LEADMALE:I do, but I sense a special dedication from you.
OTHERMALE:It's nice.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:I've been at this a long time.
SUPMALE:I know their families, been to their homes for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Really? You've been to their homes for dinner? They spread a newspaper on the floor for me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm kidding.
SUPMALE:You seem so amazed.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not amazed.
SUPFEMALE:I just think it's nice that you do that.
SUPFEMALE:I just assumed that you knew that I ate dinner.
LEADFEMALE:It's nice that you go to people's homes for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:How would you like to go home with me? I mean, for dinner.
LEADMALE:Next week? My roommates would love to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:What's a good night?
SUPMALE:Bingo night.
LEADMALE:Or I'd have to introduce you to my mother.
LEADFEMALE:But the table looked fine, right where we always keep it.
LEADMALE:But with her complexion, those yellow garden lights make Dorothy look like Eric Severeid.
OTHERFEMALE:Look out, St Dominic's.
LEADMALE:Sophia feels lucky tonight.
LEADMALE:Tonight's the big bingo game, isn't it? The biggest.
SUPMALE:I got my lucky handkerchief.
OTHERMALE:I can't lose.
SUPMALE:Where did you find it?
SUPFEMALE:In my bra.
SUPFEMALE:In your bra? What was your lucky handkerchief doing in there? I was blowing my breasts, Rose.
SUPMALE:To give me cleavage, to turn on the butcher to get a decent piece of veal.
LEADFEMALE:Now, if you'll excuse me, there's an electric weed whacker with my name on it.
LEADFEMALE:When we go out there for dinner, sit on the far side and I'll sit next to you.
LEADFEMALE:Why?
SUPFEMALE:In case anyone wants to play footsie.
LEADFEMALE:That sounds like fun.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't played footsie in years.
OTHERMALE:Charlie never
SUPMALE:Rose.
SUPMALE:Frank and Dorothy might play footsie.
SUPFEMALE:How do I look?
SUPMALE:Beautiful.
LEADMALE:Go back and change.
LEADMALE:That might be alright for a gay funeral in New Orleans, but it's too it's much too subtle for this evening.
LEADMALE:Put on something flashy.
LEADMALE:Flashy.
OTHERFEMALE:Something colourful.
LEADMALE:That's really not me, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:I know, honey, but take a chance.
LEADFEMALE:Be a woman.
LEADMALE:It's an awful lot to ask, but I'll try.
LEADMALE:Go.
OTHERMALE:Rose, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go see about supper.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you think you might be pushing Dorothy a little hard? No, and I need all your help.
OTHERFEMALE:She needs your help, too.
LEADMALE:She won't have too many chances.
LEADMALE:She doesn't have my beauty or your We'll help you next week.
LEADMALE:The point is she glows every time she speaks his name.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think Dorothy's in love? She's very definitely smitten.
SUPFEMALE:With help from us, she can fire Cupid's arrow into the tushie of love.
SUPFEMALE:The "tushie of love"? For some strange reason, I find that provocative.
LEADFEMALE:You really ought to date more, Rose.
LEADMALE:That must be him.
LEADFEMALE:Heat up the rolls and cool yourself down.
SUPMALE:Good evening.
LEADFEMALE:Good evening, Father.
SUPFEMALE:This must be an important cause.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you usually make the nuns ask for money? I'll get my purse.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm Frank.
SUPMALE:I'm here to see Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:You're the hunk? I mean Forgive me, Father.
LEADMALE:That is, forgive my language, not in your official capacity.
LEADMALE:I'm not even a Catholic.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm a Baptist and you can't forgive us Baptists.
SUPFEMALE:Sweet Jesus, why am I babbling? I meant that in all due reverence.
LEADFEMALE:I never take the Lord's name in vain.
OTHERMALE:God.
LEADFEMALE:Now I'm lying to a priest.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you come on in and sit down.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Blanche.
LEADMALE:Would you get the door? Dorothy's told me a great deal about you.
LEADMALE:Well, she left out one itty-bitty detail about you.
LEADMALE:That I'm a priest? She didn't know.
SUPFEMALE:What'd she think? You were just a boring dresser? She's just never seen me in cleric's clothing.
SUPMALE:I didn't know you priests could take your clothes off.
LEADFEMALE:We do a lot of things real people do.
LEADMALE:Except for one very important thing.
SUPMALE:Boy, is that gonna put a hitch in Dorothy's plans.
SUPMALE:Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm Rose Nylund.
LEADMALE:You must be Frank.
LEADMALE:It's a pleasure to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Nice to meet you.
SUPMALE:Dorothy's talked about you for weeks.
LEADFEMALE:Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Every time she mentions your name, she glows.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:I think she's very smitten.
LEADFEMALE:Rose.
LEADMALE:He's a priest, isn't he?
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, Rose.
LEADMALE:I'm so sorry Hell Town was cancelled.
LEADFEMALE:Frank, I'm sorry I Please tell me that's a Nehru jacket.
LEADMALE:No, it's not.
SUPMALE:Rose, let's go heat up the lasagne.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't you tell me it was Father Leahy?
LEADFEMALE:I assumed you knew.
LEADFEMALE:No, I didn't.
OTHERMALE:I mean, frankly, I'm
SUPFEMALE:I'm a little embarrassed.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:We can still be friends, can't we? Of course we can.
SUPMALE:I'm glad you're here.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, so am I.
OTHERMALE:You look lovely tonight.
SUPFEMALE:I look like the mother of a Solid Gold dancer.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, I'm sorry about this misunderstanding.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:It's alright.
LEADMALE:OK, everybody, we're ready to serve the appetisers.
LEADMALE:Come on, Frank.
LEADFEMALE:We're eating out on the lanai.
LEADFEMALE:Now, where am I supposed to sit? Where you damn well please.
LEADMALE:What difference does it make? Go.
LEADFEMALE:So first you were a teacher and then you became a priest.
LEADMALE:First, I went to medical school for a year.
OTHERMALE:Then I quit and became an assistant basketball coach, then a teacher, then came the priesthood.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think you'll do next? Anybody care for more coffee? I have another pot brewing.
SUPMALE:Let me give you a hand.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
OTHERMALE:You know, black is your colour.
LEADMALE:Did that influence your decision to enter the priesthood? It wasn't the evening I'd planned, but it's turned out to be pleasant enough.
SUPFEMALE:Frank is a very special person, isn't he? Yes, he is and he obviously thinks the same about you.
SUPMALE:Of course he does.
LEADFEMALE:We're friends.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, I hesitate to say this, but Something in Frank's eyes says he thinks of you as more than a friend.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, the man is a priest.
SUPFEMALE:The man's a man.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not listening to this.
LEADFEMALE:I was in a similar situation once.
LEADMALE:He was a man of the cloth.
SUPFEMALE:Totally dedicated to his vocation or so he said, but his eyes told me he was dedicated to me.
LEADMALE:We both knew it was wrong and we fought our feelings with every bone in our hot, longing, writhing bodies.
SUPMALE:It was just too much for us and we checked into a Best Western.
OTHERFEMALE:You had an affair with a priest? I said, "a man of the cloth.
LEADFEMALE:" He was a fabric salesman.
OTHERMALE:We never made love again, but he did cover my La-Z-Boy for free.
OTHERMALE:Wonderful, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Something in his eyes says he wants you, in the biblical sense.
OTHERMALE:I will not listen to this.
LEADFEMALE:The coffee's ready.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, the bingo game's over already? It wasn't a game.
LEADFEMALE:It was a travesty.
LEADMALE:They call four lousy numbers and, boom, Gloria's a winner.
LEADFEMALE:Six more numbers, Kessler's jumping up and down, shouting, "I'm rich.
LEADFEMALE:" Of course she also does this on the boardwalk to attract men.
OTHERMALE:I think the whole thing was fixed.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I'm gonna ask Hugh Downs to investigate.
SUPMALE:I guess they sent you over to shut me up.
LEADMALE:Ma, this is Father Leahy.
LEADFEMALE:He had dinner with us tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Pleased to meet you.
OTHERFEMALE:What happened to your date? Father Leahy is her date.
LEADFEMALE:Come here.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, sometimes a mother gets a little busy and forgets to tell her daughter everything she needs to know.
SUPFEMALE:So I'm telling you now.
SUPMALE:Don't date a priest.
OTHERMALE:It's bad luck.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma
OTHERMALE:Trust me on this one.
LEADFEMALE:What happened to me at bingo tonight was no accident.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't realise how late it was.
SUPFEMALE:I should be going.
SUPMALE:Thank you, all.
SUPMALE:I had a wonderful time.
SUPMALE:I'll see you on Saturday at the youth fair.
LEADFEMALE:Dinner before then? Something I want to talk about.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:What is it? Thanks to you, I'm on the verge of making an important decision.
SUPFEMALE:I'm thinking of leaving the Church.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought I heard you up.
SUPMALE:I couldn't sleep.
LEADFEMALE:I had a horrible nightmare.
LEADFEMALE:Tell it to me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm awful good at interpreting dreams.
LEADMALE:I was a contestant on The Dating Game and I won.
SUPMALE:I went to meet the bachelor who picked me and it was the Pope.
LEADFEMALE:That is a tough one.
SUPFEMALE:Where did you go on the date? Forget it, forget it.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:What are you doing? I thought you were asleep.
LEADFEMALE:Provisions.
LEADMALE:I figured we'd be up all night talking.
LEADMALE:I'm going.
LEADFEMALE:She don't feel like talking.
LEADMALE:But I got chocolate macadamia-nut cheesecake and rum-raisin ice cream.
LEADFEMALE:Alright.
SUPFEMALE:Start cutting.
LEADFEMALE:You scoop.
LEADMALE:That's my girl.
LEADFEMALE:Did you decide what you're gonna do? No.
SUPFEMALE:My luck.
LEADMALE:The first really wonderful guy I've met in a long time and he turns out to have a more serious involvement.
LEADFEMALE:With whom?
SUPMALE:Pam Dawber.
LEADMALE:The Church.
SUPMALE:Or he did until he met me.
LEADMALE:Take the religious aspect out of this and it's romantic.
OTHERMALE:Giving up everything for the woman he loves, like the Duke of Windsor.
LEADMALE:Or the story of Rose and Charlie Nylund.
SUPMALE:When I think of one, I automatically think of the other.
LEADFEMALE:When Charlie and I started dating, I felt his folks didn't like me.
LEADMALE:That's when I decided to get to the bottom of things and the ancient feud between the Nylunds and the Gorkleknabygens.
OTHERMALE:That was my mother's maiden name.
SUPMALE:Gorkleknabygen? Originally, it was Gorkleknabygen-Höffstädlerfeil.
SUPFEMALE:But they shortened it.
LEADMALE:Most of my mother's family were in show business.
LEADMALE:Anyway, when Charlie told them we were gonna get married, they forbade it.
LEADFEMALE:They said they'd disown him if he married
SUPFEMALE:A Gorkleknabygen.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:He'd lose his share of the family tile grout fortune.
LEADFEMALE:He didn't care.
SUPFEMALE:He told them he loved me more than grout.
SUPMALE:Must have been a tough choice for old Charlie.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I heard voices.
SUPFEMALE:Only two of them are God-fearing.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, get off my back.
SUPFEMALE:I feel bad enough.
SUPFEMALE:What about me? even when the Pope said I didn't have to.
LEADMALE:I go to Mass, I light candles, and for what? To be flushed down the toilet, because my daughter dates Father Happy Pants.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you're not making it any easier.
SUPMALE:Look, Dorothy, in the end, only you can decide what's right for you.
LEADMALE:Whatever decision it is, I'll stand by you.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Just remember, make the wrong decision, you'll burn in hell forever.
LEADMALE:Sleep tight, pussycat.
SUPMALE:I'm not here to confess, I did that a day ago.
SUPMALE:At my age, how much can I sin? I had an impure thought? I'd kill to have an impure thought.
LEADMALE:That would be two sins.
LEADFEMALE:But now I'm telling you your business.
SUPMALE:Let me get to the real point.
LEADFEMALE:It's about you and my daughter.
LEADMALE:I know everything and, frankly, I'm not thrilled.
LEADFEMALE:If you wanna leave the priesthood, that's between you and the Vatican, but you should know about Dorothy, before you get carried away.
LEADMALE:So, Frank, have you made your decision? I can serve the Church better as a teaching priest at St Helen's, instead of a parish priest here.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna miss you around here.
LEADMALE:Look, I know priests are men and they have urges.
SUPFEMALE:What is it, lust? It'll pass.
LEADMALE:I do without.
LEADMALE:You get used to it.
LEADMALE:Get cable TV.
LEADMALE:Lots of luck.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Frank.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy?
OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing here?
LEADMALE:Free time between classes.
LEADFEMALE:So you drove 18 miles across town? OK.
OTHERFEMALE:I wanted to talk to you.
LEADMALE:I didn't want to wait.
LEADMALE:The thought that I might be responsible for the decision you're making is too much.
SUPMALE:This is crazy.
LEADMALE:It's not like you pushed me towards this decision.
SUPMALE:You didn't know I was thinking about it.
SUPMALE:Blanche did.
OTHERMALE:She saw it in your eyes.
SUPFEMALE:My eyes?
LEADMALE:You're a very special person.
LEADFEMALE:I knew the moment I met you and you felt the same about me.
LEADFEMALE:I can't tell you how flattering that is.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, at this stage of a woman's life, to have someone instantly feel that spark for her is a dream come true.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe in the dream he wouldn't be a priest, but that doesn't make it any the less flattering, but it does make it a lot more complicated.
LEADFEMALE:So, Frank, you cannot go through with this.
LEADMALE:Dorothy.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:It's a mistake that we would both regret for the rest of our lives.
LEADFEMALE:No matter how strongly you feel, I cannot let you leave the priesthood for me.
OTHERMALE:What? I understand how hurt you must feel.
SUPMALE:Alright, maybe I don't understand exactly.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry, Dorothy, but our relationship seems to be one misunderstanding after another.
LEADFEMALE:Misunderstanding? I'm not leaving the priesthood.
SUPMALE:I'm leaving the Church, this church.
LEADMALE:But Well If you're not leaving the priesthood, then I just made a complete ass of myself.
LEADMALE:Excuse my language, Father, but, as an English teacher, I can tell you that's the most appropriate description.
OTHERFEMALE:No, it's not.
LEADMALE:How can you say that? I created an entire relationship in my imagination.
SUPMALE:It wasn't in your imagination.
SUPMALE:There is something special between us.
LEADMALE:We appreciate each other.
LEADMALE:You could help me see where I could do most good, as a teaching priest.
OTHERFEMALE:It's taken me a little while, but I think I've got it.
LEADMALE:Alright.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, your silence is deafening.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't wanna whip this one out, but I have no choice.
OTHERFEMALE:She's been divorced.
SUPFEMALE:You know the rulebook.
LEADFEMALE:We're talking eternity here.
LEADMALE:Are we still on for dinner Thursday night? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Just so there won't be another misunderstanding, who is buying?
LEADFEMALE:How about a Dutch treat?
OTHERMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:See you Thursday.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, thanks.
SUPMALE:It's like you didn't hear a word I said! 
LEADFEMALE:
