OTHERMALE:Ma, what are you doing? It's a funny little habit I picked up.
OTHERMALE:I call it eating.
SUPMALE:Rose made it for her daughter.
SUPFEMALE:You can't eat till she comes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please, there's enough food here to feed my entire village in Sicily.
LEADMALE:Blanche.
LEADMALE:Help me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my back gave out.
LEADFEMALE:I figured that would be the third thing to go.
OTHERFEMALE:What happened? I was in my aerobics class when I noticed this gorgeous man.
LEADMALE:During the buttocks lifts, he motioned for my number.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't wanna appear easy, so I rolled over and flung my legs over my head.
LEADMALE:That's what I call giving him the brush-off.
SUPMALE:Hi, Mom.
SUPMALE:My God, it's Michael.
SUPFEMALE:Michael.
LEADMALE:Look, Ma, it's Michael.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, honey, what a surprise.
OTHERFEMALE:You look great.
LEADMALE:I'm glad to see you.
SUPMALE:I've missed you.
LEADMALE:Why the hell haven't you written, you little ingrate? He's a musician in New York.
OTHERMALE:He hasn't time to write.
LEADMALE:Hi, Grandma.
LEADMALE:Don't hi me.
LEADFEMALE:You can't pick up a phone and call your grandmother? You look terrific, Grandma.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:So give me a kiss.
OTHERFEMALE:I want you to meet my friend, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, Michael.
SUPFEMALE:I would get up but I've thrown my back out of whack You don't have to explain.
LEADFEMALE:Mother told me about you.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't you say you were coming?
LEADFEMALE:I could have cooked a meal.
LEADMALE:My job at the jazz club ended so I came here.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so glad you did.
SUPFEMALE:You play jazz? The only white boy from Brooklyn who could scat.
LEADFEMALE:But I thought the job was till the end of summer.
LEADMALE:I had artistic differences with the club owner.
SUPFEMALE:People pick on him because he's talented.
LEADFEMALE:He wanted everyone to wear a tie and I refused.
LEADMALE:Michael stands up for his principles.
LEADFEMALE:He's the Norma Rae of the music business.
SUPMALE:Everybody, I want you to meet my daughter, Bridget.
LEADMALE:Bridget, this is Blanche.
LEADMALE:And Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:And Sophia.
SUPMALE:And a total stranger.
LEADFEMALE:This is my son, Michael.
OTHERFEMALE:He's staying with us.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, you don't have the space.
LEADMALE:Don't be silly, you can have my room.
LEADFEMALE:I'll camp out on the couch.
LEADMALE:Michael, it's nice meeting you.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy's told us about you.
LEADFEMALE:This is my daughter, Bridget.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Bridget's going to study at Oxford, England.
LEADFEMALE:I've found a terrific flat on campus.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:I hear the commute from here's a killer.
OTHERFEMALE:Pardon me?
SUPFEMALE:It was a joke.
SUPMALE:Cute.
SUPFEMALE:Where do you go to school? College isn't really my style.
SUPFEMALE:I attend the school of life.
LEADFEMALE:A lot of people go there when they can't get accepted anywhere else.
LEADMALE:Cute.
SUPFEMALE:Bridget, I know you're hungry after your trip, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:I fixed your favourite things.
SUPFEMALE:It looks delicious.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:Where are the wooden shoes I carved out of cheese? My mother spread them on the tiny windmill you built out of Triscuits.
LEADFEMALE:This is my best breakfast in ages.
SUPMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:Normally she feeds me lumpy oatmeal and black bananas.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do that.
LEADFEMALE:No, you won't.
SUPMALE:You don't have to.
LEADMALE:I enjoy doing it.
SUPFEMALE:Here, why not double your fun?
OTHERFEMALE:Good morning.
SUPFEMALE:How's your back?
SUPFEMALE:Terrible.
SUPMALE:What did the doctor say? I am the most spectacular specimen of the female anatomy he has seen since Julie Newmar.
LEADMALE:He said it's a back problem.
LEADFEMALE:Thank God he's a specialist.
SUPFEMALE:He said no activity for a week.
SUPMALE:I have to wear a corset and lie back with my legs elevated.
LEADFEMALE:That's the same thing you did last Saturday.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, you just follow the doctor's orders and everything'll be fine.
SUPMALE:I don't think I can go without physical activity for a week.
OTHERFEMALE:I have serious needs.
LEADMALE:I'm at my sexual peak.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I am, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:When a woman's at her peak
SUPMALE:This is my child.
LEADFEMALE:I wish you wouldn't treat me like a child.
LEADMALE:Don't be ridiculous.
LEADMALE:I don't treat you like one.
SUPFEMALE:Here's $10.
LEADFEMALE:Go take your grandmother to see The Journey Of Natty Gann.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up and take the money.
SUPMALE:Forget the movie.
SUPMALE:We'll double our money at the track, and goof on bums.
OTHERMALE:Michael seems like a nice man.
LEADMALE:Oh, he really is.
SUPMALE:But I'm worried about him.
LEADFEMALE:He's always been a little flighty.
OTHERFEMALE:I wouldn't worry about that.
LEADMALE:Grandma always said I was a little flighty.
SUPMALE:Or was it a little floozy?
OTHERFEMALE:Morning, everyone.
SUPFEMALE:You want some breakfast? No.
SUPFEMALE:Bridget packed a delicious meal and drove me to the country.
SUPFEMALE:We took a walk and picked wild flowers.
OTHERFEMALE:We waded in the creek and then guess what? Julie Andrews showed up, you all fed deer and sang, "If I Had A Hammer".
OTHERMALE:Rose, sounds like you had a lovely morning.
LEADMALE:Oh, it was.
LEADMALE:But it made me sad.
LEADFEMALE:I realised how much I'll miss her.
LEADFEMALE:We've always been close.
SUPMALE:I was the same way with Michael.
LEADFEMALE:Was? I thought you got on great.
OTHERMALE:It's not that we don't get on.
SUPFEMALE:It's just that we think differently.
OTHERMALE:I think he should settle down and find a job.
SUPMALE:He thinks he should be travelling over the country, trying to find himself.
OTHERMALE:Maybe what Michael needs is a little exposure.
LEADFEMALE:Exposure to what?
SUPFEMALE:To plutonium, Rose.
LEADMALE:To somebody more career-oriented, somebody like Bridget.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe if they spent time together, she'd be a positive influence.
LEADFEMALE:Are you suggesting that Michael and Bridget go out? That is exactly what I'm suggesting.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:I stay out of my children's social lives.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid I agree with Rose.
SUPMALE:Like that Scandinavian saying, "You can lead a herring to water but you have to walk really fast or he'll die.
OTHERMALE:" Alright, fine.
LEADFEMALE:I thought they'd have more fun together instead of hanging around with me and three old ladies.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get changed.
SUPFEMALE:Bridget's taking me to the House of Fabrics for the felt sale.
SUPFEMALE:I hope I don't get too crazy.
LEADMALE:You'd better take a tranquilliser before you go.
OTHERFEMALE:Remember, last time, you hyperventilated and almost passed out.
LEADMALE:I never passed out at the House of Fabrics.
SUPFEMALE:I passed out at the World of Wool.
LEADMALE:For the first time in my life, my body feels old.
LEADFEMALE:I can't do the things I used to.
SUPFEMALE:Rubber Woman couldn't do the things you used to.
SUPFEMALE:It's only natural that, as you're growing older, your body changes.
LEADMALE:It falls apart.
LEADFEMALE:It does not fall apart.
LEADFEMALE:For 50 years, I look like Chita Rivera.
LEADFEMALE:One morning, my butt's like a bulldog's neck.
LEADMALE:I remember when I felt I was getting older.
LEADFEMALE:I was visiting my daughter.
SUPMALE:She had a walk-up apartment, five flights up.
LEADFEMALE:It got harder and harder each year to climb those stairs.
LEADMALE:Finally, one year, I couldn't make it without stopping.
LEADFEMALE:It depressed me for weeks.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:Is that what I have to look forward to, 15 years from now?
SUPFEMALE:Another game?
LEADMALE:I don't feel like it.
LEADMALE:Play with Michael.
LEADFEMALE:He's not here.
LEADFEMALE:Where is he?
LEADFEMALE:You were at the market.
OTHERMALE:The kids decided to go out.
SUPMALE:Michael asked Bridget out?
LEADFEMALE:Not exactly, no.
LEADMALE:I just happened to have some free tickets to the symphony.
LEADFEMALE:So I suggested they take 'em.
LEADFEMALE:Both Rose and I told you not to interfere with their social lives.
LEADMALE:I just thought it might be fun.
LEADMALE:A set-up date is never fun.
OTHERFEMALE:In Sicily, everything is set up.
SUPFEMALE:Dates, marriage, death.
LEADFEMALE:Especially death.
SUPMALE:Whenever I go into a restaurant, I sit with my back to the wall.
SUPMALE:Except any diner in Newark, where if you're against the wall, you stick.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Shouldn't you be lying down? But I'm tired of being on my back.
LEADMALE:Did I just say that? Are the kids back from their date?
LEADFEMALE:Our kids?
LEADFEMALE:No, the Katzenjammer Kids.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course our kids.
LEADMALE:We decided not to interfere.
LEADFEMALE:We did, but Blanche here decided differently.
SUPMALE:Oh, Blanche, how could you? Well, I don't know what all the fuss is about.
OTHERFEMALE:I heard 'em come in hours ago.
LEADFEMALE:I'll say good night to Bridget.
SUPMALE:Can you bring my heating pad?
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, do you realise it's been four days since I've enjoyed the company of a man? I know, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I've been marking the days off on my Big Ships of the Navy calendar.
LEADMALE:I can't stand it much longer.
SUPFEMALE:My body feels like a Corvette on blocks with its engine racing and the wheels just spinning with nowhere to go.
LEADFEMALE:I feel like I'm gonna explode.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, you must help me.
SUPFEMALE:Do something.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, there's nothing I can do.
LEADFEMALE:So let go of my hand.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:Hi there.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, don't look.
LEADFEMALE:Michael, get out of that bed.
SUPMALE:Believe me, Mom, I'd like to.
SUPFEMALE:But as my clothes are hanging on the doorknob, it's not a good idea.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:They're naked.
LEADFEMALE:People usually are in this situation, Rose.
LEADMALE:Unless they're all dressed up in costumes.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:What's all the commotion? Oh, boy.
SUPMALE:This isn't what it looks like.
LEADMALE:I'm 80 years old.
LEADFEMALE:I may not remember what it feels like, but I remember what it looks like.
SUPMALE:Grandma, listen
LEADMALE:You, listen.
SUPMALE:How dare you come here and act like a gigolo? You've embarrassed me, your mother, our friends.
LEADFEMALE:Not to mention that poor, stupid, flat-chested girl.
LEADMALE:You've broken my heart.
LEADMALE:I'm ashamed you're my grandson.
LEADMALE:Look what you've done.
SUPFEMALE:I hope you're proud of yourself.
LEADMALE:Bridget, I am shocked at your behaviour.
LEADMALE:Why doesn't everybody just calm down? Bridget and Michael went out, had a great time.
SUPFEMALE:It was nice.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't call it great.
LEADMALE:Sorry, too much wine.
SUPFEMALE:Would you like us to leave so you can try again? Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I don't think we should encourage them.
LEADMALE:Why don't we let them get dressed? Then we can discuss this like rational human beings.
SUPFEMALE:That's a good idea, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Rose, I meant let them get dressed in private.
OTHERMALE:Oh, sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess I'm still in shock.
SUPFEMALE:I've never seen Bridget in bed with a man.
SUPFEMALE:Except Raggedy Andy.
LEADMALE:I just can't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:Believe it, Rose.
LEADMALE:I can't.
LEADMALE:You know when you can't believe something? I can't believe Alan Thicke has a hit series.
LEADFEMALE:That doesn't mean it isn't so.
SUPFEMALE:I blame you for this, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Why? But for that date, Michael wouldn't have seduced Bridget.
LEADFEMALE:What? He didn't seduce her.
SUPFEMALE:You were there?
SUPFEMALE:I happen to know.
LEADFEMALE:How?
SUPFEMALE:Bridget isn't his type.
OTHERFEMALE:No, she's too good for him.
LEADFEMALE:How about a nice glass of lemonade?
LEADMALE:Why is she too good for him?
SUPMALE:He has no job.
LEADFEMALE:Neither does Henry Kissinger but he's still highly regarded.
SUPMALE:My son is an artist.
LEADFEMALE:A nice way of saying loser.
LEADMALE:My son is not a loser.
LEADMALE:He happens to be very talented.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, at taking advantage of poor young girls.
OTHERFEMALE:You agree he does have talent.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, face it, your daughter moves faster than Marcus Allen.
LEADFEMALE:I can't face it.
LEADMALE:I don't even know who Marcus Allen is.
SUPFEMALE:Let me put it to you another way.
LEADFEMALE:When are you gonna accept that your daughter is not the goody two-shoes you think?
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean?
LEADMALE:What would you call a girl who sleeps with a man she's known for one day? A damn good sport.
LEADFEMALE:I call her a tramp.
SUPMALE:What? You heard me, tramp.
OTHERFEMALE:Tramp, tramp, tramp.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, we've always had our differences.
OTHERFEMALE:But I don't think you've said anything so vicious or so cruel.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think I can speak to you again.
SUPFEMALE:Go after her.
LEADMALE:I will not.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not the only one who was cruel.
LEADMALE:Morning.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not talking to you.
SUPMALE:You're still upset with me about last night? No, I'm upset because Crockett and Tubbs are wearing darker colours.
LEADMALE:Good morning.
SUPFEMALE:Why are you dressed like that? I'm introducing my line of tennis wear.
SUPFEMALE:What do you think? I'm in mourning.
LEADMALE:For whom, Sophia?
LEADFEMALE:Michael.
SUPFEMALE:After last night, he doesn't exist.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, excuse me, I didn't see you.
LEADMALE:Morning, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I guess you're still mad at me, too, huh?
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, girls.
OTHERFEMALE:Nobody could be more upset about last night than I am.
LEADMALE:I was just trying to be hospitable.
LEADMALE:I sent the kids to the symphony to hear Henry Mancini's tribute to the Pink Panther.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't expect them to jump into bed.
OTHERMALE:Besides, it's not the end of the world.
OTHERMALE:These things do happen.
SUPFEMALE:The same thing happened to me in my early 20s.
LEADMALE:I was taking some classes at Miss McGyver's finishing school.
LEADMALE:One night, Bobby Jo Springer had escorted me back to my dormitory after the annual Fine Manners ball, when an innocent good-night kiss developed into an evening of passion.
LEADFEMALE:But at 3am, the door flung open and there stood Miss McGyver, making one of those bed checks she was famous for.
LEADFEMALE:I tried to handle the whole thing like a lady.
OTHERMALE:I waved politely over Bobby Jo's shoulder with my foot.
LEADMALE:She was unmoved.
LEADMALE:Next day, she sat me down, lectured me and kicked me out of school.
LEADMALE:Only, I didn't care.
SUPFEMALE:I knew what ecstasy was.
LEADMALE:All she could do was walk around with a dictionary on her head.
LEADFEMALE:Alright, maybe you don't feel like talking to me.
OTHERMALE:But talk to your children.
LEADFEMALE:Tell them how you feel.
LEADMALE:Only, make sure after it's all over that it's brought you closer together, not further apart.
LEADMALE:Who are you, Mr Spock? I think you mean Dr Spock, Sophia.
LEADMALE:They're both real smart and they've got big ears, so don't get technical, OK? I am speaking from experience, Sophia.
LEADMALE:I failed to listen to my children.
LEADFEMALE:You don't see any of them visiting here.
LEADMALE:I don't even see my hand in front of my face.
LEADMALE:Blanche, you're making a lot of sense.
SUPFEMALE:We were so busy protecting our kids, we fought with each other.
LEADMALE:I owe you an apology.
SUPMALE:I owe you one.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no
SUPMALE:Girls, what's the difference? The important thing is, we're all friends again.
LEADMALE:Maybe you're all friends again, but not me.
SUPMALE:I don't forgive or forget.
LEADFEMALE:I'm prone to growing moles.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Italian.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, please, go on.
LEADFEMALE:That's enough.
LEADFEMALE:Let's talk about last night.
SUPMALE:Sure, Ma.
OTHERMALE:You ungrateful brat, how could you do this to me? I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:That's not what I planned on saying.
OTHERMALE:It's OK.
LEADMALE:You've every right to be angry.
SUPFEMALE:I don't understand how you could do this.
LEADMALE:It wasn't anything planned.
LEADMALE:The whole thing just kind of happened.
LEADFEMALE:Just kind of happened? Michael, dandruff just kind of happens.
SUPMALE:Not a thing like this.
LEADMALE:If you don't know that, I've failed somewhere.
LEADMALE:Stop torturing yourself.
LEADMALE:None of this is your fault.
LEADFEMALE:It is.
SUPFEMALE:Where did I go wrong?
LEADMALE:You're a great mother.
LEADMALE:If I were, you would be graduating from medical school, not playing doctor with my best friend's daughter here in this house.
LEADMALE:Ma, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:It wasn't the right time and it ended up embarrassing you and your friends.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I wasn't thinking.
LEADFEMALE:That's your problem, Michael.
SUPFEMALE:You go through life not thinking.
LEADMALE:You go from town to town, job to job, relationship to relationship.
SUPMALE:Michael, you're 29 years old.
SUPFEMALE:When will you grow up and accept some responsibility? I'm sorry about what happened.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry I won't be all you hoped I'd be.
LEADMALE:The only thing I want you to be is happy.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want you waking up one morning, sorry for choices you made.
LEADMALE:I appreciate that.
SUPMALE:But, Ma, I have to live my own life.
LEADFEMALE:Despite my flaws, I am basically a decent, honest person.
SUPMALE:Do you think you could just love me for that? I already do.
LEADFEMALE:Then you forgive me? Of course I forgive you.
LEADMALE:But if you ever pull a stunt like that again, I am going to throw you out on your flawed but honest behind.
LEADFEMALE:So, did you two make up?
LEADMALE:Yes, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Did you apologise and beg her forgiveness?
LEADMALE:Yes, Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:OK, now do it to me.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't hurt you.
OTHERFEMALE:I hope you can forgive me.
LEADFEMALE:That's it?
LEADFEMALE:I promise to write more often.
OTHERMALE:And?
LEADFEMALE:And call you every week.
LEADMALE:Every week? You think I don't have a social life? You can call me every other week.
LEADMALE:OK, every other week.
LEADFEMALE:Good, you're forgiven.
SUPFEMALE:Thank God this is over.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't see a thing through this crap.
LEADFEMALE:I'm all packed and ready to go.
LEADFEMALE:I'll have your lunch done soon.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, I think we should talk.
LEADMALE:Why don't we forget about it?
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to.
LEADMALE:I forgive you.
SUPFEMALE:I know it wasn't your fault.
OTHERMALE:Mom.
LEADMALE:You've got to stop pretending I'm some perfect angel.
SUPMALE:I'm not.
LEADFEMALE:I make mistakes.
LEADFEMALE:What I did the other night was one of them.
SUPMALE:I am sorry about embarrassing you and your friends.
LEADMALE:But that doesn't change the fact that I slept with Michael.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, I so wanted your first time to be special.
SUPMALE:It was, Mom.
SUPMALE:Four years ago.
LEADMALE:Oh, I really don't wanna talk about this.
SUPMALE:I want us to talk about this.
SUPFEMALE:I want us to have an open, honest relationship.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna be able to share my deepest, darkest secrets with you.
LEADFEMALE:Couldn't we just wear matching outfits? Mother.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, honey, but it's just that Suddenly, it's like you're a whole new person.
OTHERFEMALE:It's gonna take a little getting used to.
OTHERMALE:I understand.
LEADMALE:I'll miss you very much.
LEADFEMALE:I'll miss you, too, Mom.
LEADMALE:You're sure I can't drive you to the airport? No, I'll be fine.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, Sophia, thank you for having me.
OTHERMALE:Don't thank me, thank my grandson.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, gotta go.
LEADMALE:I thought you were staying till the end of the week.
LEADFEMALE:I got a call for a gig in New Orleans.
SUPMALE:Good luck to you, sweetheart.
OTHERMALE:Call me when you get there.
LEADFEMALE:I will.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye, Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Be good, Michael.
SUPMALE:Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Wanna share a taxi?
LEADFEMALE:Sounds great.
SUPFEMALE:Make sure that's all you share.
SUPFEMALE:You two have a safe trip.
OTHERMALE:Bye-bye, Mom.
LEADMALE:Girls, how do I look?
SUPFEMALE:Where are you going?
LEADMALE:On a date.
LEADFEMALE:The doctor said take it easy.
OTHERMALE:He did, but I'm going stir-crazy.
SUPMALE:I have to get out.
LEADMALE:Stick to the doctor's orders.
LEADFEMALE:I think Dorothy's right.
SUPFEMALE:Who knows my body better than I do? Any man in Miami not attached to a woman or a respirator.
SUPFEMALE:
