LEADMALE:He should have been here a half-hour ago.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, according to the rules of etiquette, you should never wait more than 20 minutes for a date.
LEADMALE:She's already waited six months for a date.
LEADFEMALE:What's another half-hour? I hate blind dates.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Ma, I never would have agreed to this if it wasn't your best friend Edna's good-looking doctor nephew.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, he wasn't available anymore.
LEADMALE:He decided to buy a woman from the Philippines.
OTHERFEMALE:Actually, he bought two women.
LEADMALE:He wanted an extra for formal occasions.
OTHERMALE:Then who is this guy? To tell you the truth, I was on the bus Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:You set Dorothy up with some guy you met on a bus? Please, it wasn't that glamorous.
SUPMALE:I saw a sign on the bus.
LEADMALE:It said, "Lonely? Can't make connections with that special person?" So I took $20 out of your purse, sent in a picture, they ran it through the computer and boom, you got a social life.
LEADMALE:Ma, I cannot believe you sent my picture in to a total stranger.
LEADMALE:I didn't send in your picture, I sent the picture that came with my wallet.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, I am furious with you.
SUPFEMALE:Think how mad your date's gonna be when he finds out he's not going out with Janet Gaynor.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, God! Dorothy, just remember how important first impressions are, honey.
SUPMALE:Stand up straight.
LEADFEMALE:Put your left hand on your hip.
SUPMALE:Now, strike a very sexy, sultry pose.
LEADMALE: Hello.
LEADMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with your hip? I was hoping you'd be my date, Rose.
SUPMALE:Oh, gee, I'm busy tonight.
SUPMALE:But maybe you could try me again next week.
LEADFEMALE:What's in the box, Rose? Brochures for the "Be a Pal" program.
SUPMALE:I'm mailing them out.
OTHERFEMALE:How does that work? Well, you just put 'em in an envelope and you stick a stamp on them.
LEADFEMALE:Not that, you idiot.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, the "Be a Pal" program? Well, each week, you get a motherless girl and be her pal.
LEADFEMALE:Help her with her homework and take her to movies and have dinner together.
LEADMALE:That's very interesting.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I could get involved with that.
LEADMALE:You, Blanche? Sure.
OTHERMALE:Why, nothing would be more satisfying than to be of loving service to a lonely, motherless child.
OTHERMALE:Of course, I'll have to see pictures of the father before I commit.
OTHERFEMALE:If you're interested, I could call and see about sending over two girls.
OTHERFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Count me in.
OTHERMALE: Hi, I'm Eddie.
LEADMALE:It took a computer to come up with this? I'm Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:These are my friends, Blanche and Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, there.
OTHERFEMALE:How do you do? Eddie, I hope you're not too terribly disappointed.
LEADMALE:My mother wasn't exactly honest in sending in that picture.
LEADFEMALE:I knew that.
OTHERMALE:I have quite a few Janet Gaynors in frames around my house.
SUPFEMALE:Believe me, when you've been in a deep depression for a year and a half, nothing fazes you.
SUPFEMALE:Well Eddie, what wonderful things have you got planned for tonight? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I was gonna cancel, but my therapist wouldn't let me.
LEADMALE:Perhaps if we spoke to him together? I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I'm still not really recovered.
LEADFEMALE:You see, after 25 years of marriage, my wife Roberta sent me a Dear John letter.
SUPFEMALE:That's terrible.
LEADFEMALE:Married 25 years and she doesn't know your name is Eddie? Well, I guess I have to feed you.
OTHERMALE:Let's go look for a place to eat, Roberta.
OTHERMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:Her name's Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Your ex-wife is Roberta.
SUPFEMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Rub my nose in it.
LEADMALE:Morning, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:You're up early.
LEADMALE:I'm making a list of things to do with our little pals.
OTHERFEMALE:I just hope I'm good at it.
LEADMALE:With all that enthusiasm, I'm sure you will be.
LEADMALE:I just wanna make a difference in the lives of these youngsters.
OTHERFEMALE:I wanna teach 'em, I wanna mold 'em.
OTHERMALE:I wanna become a positive influence on every aspect of their young lives.
SUPFEMALE:It is only one afternoon a week, isn't it? Dorothy Zbornak, are you just getting in? No, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I got up early and went jogging in a park with a really strict dress code.
LEADMALE:Now, if you'll excuse me, I need some coffee.
LEADFEMALE:What's the number of the police station? Is anything wrong? No, I just wanna find out where I can buy the best donuts.
LEADFEMALE:Of course something is wrong! Dorothy never came home.
LEADMALE:Yes, she did.
LEADFEMALE:She's in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:All right, spill it.
LEADMALE:I want details.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, so do I.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, me too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there is not much to tell.
OTHERMALE:Eddie took me to the restaurant where he had met his ex-wife Roberta.
LEADFEMALE:I would think going there would just remind him of her.
LEADFEMALE:It did.
LEADFEMALE:Especially since she owns it, runs it and calls the place Roberta's.
LEADFEMALE:As she was seating us, he begged her to come back to him.
OTHERFEMALE:And after he had wept over his crab cakes, I begged her to come back to him.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess you're not gonna see him again.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I will.
SUPFEMALE:What? Listen, pussycat, it's been a long time since you've been out on a date.
LEADFEMALE:And it's quite possible you can no longer judge a good one from a bad one.
LEADMALE:So let me be of help.
LEADFEMALE:Bad date, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Bad, bad date.
LEADFEMALE:What did you do the rest of the night? I tried to comfort him.
SUPMALE:I must have lost track of time 'cause next thing I knew it was morning.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I better get some rest.
LEADMALE:We're meeting for lunch.
LEADMALE:I don't get it.
LEADMALE:They don't seem to have anything in common.
OTHERMALE:I guess it's just like that old 
LEADFEMALE:opposites attract.
SUPFEMALE:That's very true.
OTHERMALE:Back in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf Ollie Canudenspringle and his wife Bridget were opposites in every way.
SUPMALE:I mean, he was fat, she was thin.
SUPMALE:He was neat, she was sloppy.
LEADFEMALE:He was tall, she was short.
OTHERMALE:He was cheap, she was extravagant.
LEADFEMALE:He was Opposites.
OTHERMALE:We get the picture.
OTHERMALE:Anyway, I'll never forget the time they sang at our annual talent show, right after the herring juggling act.
OTHERMALE:You mean to tell me that somebody actually juggled herring? No.
SUPFEMALE:It was the herring who did the juggling.
OTHERFEMALE:Tiny little Ginsu knives.
SUPMALE:Really very dangerous.
OTHERMALE:I mean, one false move, they could have filleted themselves.
SUPFEMALE:I hate you.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway  Oh, good.
SUPMALE:Here they are.
LEADMALE:Come in, girls.
SUPMALE:I'm Marla, this is Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:We're from the "Be a Pal" program.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, and I'm Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I just knew when I heard your voice on the phone that you'd be pretty.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, thank you.
SUPMALE:Rose, this is my little pal Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:And your little pal Marla.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Marla.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, sit down.
SUPFEMALE:Now, is there anything special you girls feel like doing today? Would it be too much to see a movie? Oh, no.
LEADMALE:We can go see Oliver & Company or Roger Rabbit.
OTHERFEMALE:Or Tequila Sunrise.
LEADMALE:I hear Mel Gibson takes his shirt off a lot.
SUPMALE:You know, Jackie, I think you and I are gonna get along just fine.
LEADMALE:Well, just let me freshen my makeup.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, why don't you come with me and I'll show you how I transform myself into a fresh-faced, innocent, young thing? Could you skip the "innocent" part, Blanche? The show starts in two hours.
SUPMALE:Hi, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche around? She's showing the girls some makeup tricks before we go to the movies.
LEADFEMALE:Anything I can do? No, thanks.
LEADMALE:I need to talk to somebody.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I get it.
LEADFEMALE:You have a problem and you don't think I'm sophisticated or worldly enough to help.
SUPMALE:Oh, Rose, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:You got a minute? Sure, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:It's about Eddie.
LEADMALE:You know, I've been seeing him for a week now.
SUPMALE:I'm having a relationship with him like I've never had with a man before in my life.
LEADMALE:It is purely physical.
LEADMALE:Eddie is the greatest lover I have ever had.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:If we're gonna do this, you have to tell me the truth.
SUPMALE:No, I am telling you the truth.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, there is more to Eddie than meets the eye.
LEADFEMALE:But the only thing we have in common is under the sheets.
LEADFEMALE:What's under the sheets? His cappuccino maker.
SUPFEMALE:Sex, Rose.
LEADMALE:I am talking sex.
OTHERFEMALE:We don't go to dinner, we don't go to the movies, we just go to bed and it is terrific.
SUPFEMALE:All that and cappuccino too? Well, what's the problem? Did I say there was a problem? You wanted to talk about it.
LEADFEMALE:Can't one have a discussion without there being a problem? I thought maybe you were feeling guilty.
LEADMALE:Guilty? I have nothing to feel guilty about.
SUPMALE:I am having the time of my life.
OTHERFEMALE:I just wanted to, you know, say it out loud.
LEADMALE:But, listen, honey.
LEADMALE:Don't mention this to anybody.
LEADFEMALE:It's a thing that most people probably wouldn't understand.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Rose Nylund can keep a secret.
LEADMALE:Do you know what the name Nylund means in Norwegian? No.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm not telling you.
OTHERMALE:How do I look? Great, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:You going out with Eddie? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, by the way, Blanche, I borrowed your gold earrings, if that's OK? Oh, it's fine, but I do think I should caution you
LEADFEMALE:they were meant for petite ears.
LEADMALE:They'll just have to do until Disney unveils their Dumbo line.
OTHERMALE:I'd better grab something to eat before Eddie gets here.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you just go out to eat? There never seems to be enough time.
LEADMALE:You know, there's something rotten in the state of Denmark.
OTHERMALE:It's their cheese.
LEADMALE:They refuse to use preservatives.
LEADMALE:I mean between Dorothy and Eddie.
LEADFEMALE:There is something peculiar in that relationship.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:And I'm gonna find out what it is or my name isn't Sophia Sophia Sophia Petrillo.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Maybe the doctor is right.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I do need all three pills a day.
SUPMALE:Dorothy will never tell her.
LEADMALE:Tell her what? The secret that I don't know.
SUPMALE:Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:There's something you know that you're not telling me.
LEADMALE:You can ask me all the questions you want, you'll never break me.
LEADMALE:So you're not in love with this Eddie guy? Oh, no, Ma.
OTHERMALE:Then why are you spending all your time with him? Eddie's a love machine? I'm sorry, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:I held out as long as I could.
LEADMALE:She said she'd tickle me.
LEADMALE:You're a regular Nelson Mandela, Rose.
SUPMALE:So that's it? Lust.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Ma, I am a grown woman and I have needs.
OTHERFEMALE:Needs? You need food.
LEADFEMALE:You need air.
LEADMALE:You need a better wrinkle cream.
SUPFEMALE:You don't need sport nookie.
SUPFEMALE:This is wrong for you.
LEADMALE:Wrong for me? This is why I didn't tell you about this in the first place.
LEADMALE:You are always criticizing me, you are always judging me, you are always telling me what to do.
LEADMALE:This time I'm going to do what feels right for me, and there's nothing you can say that'll make me feel guilty about it.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I wish I'd married Bing Crosby when I had the chance.
LEADMALE:Why? Because he was such a strict disciplinarian? No, because now I'd be a wealthy widow with my own place in Pebble Beach, so I wouldn't have to listen to that crap.
LEADFEMALE:I just haven't found a thing today.
SUPMALE:I don't look right in American clothes.
SUPFEMALE:I have a more European body.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, in Europe, do they all have big butts too? Hi, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Hi, Rose.
LEADMALE:Where on earth have you girls been? We were helping elderly people get a good grip on the escalator.
LEADFEMALE:We just lost all track of time.
LEADFEMALE:How sweet.
SUPMALE:Isn't that sweet? Can you guys hold our bags? We wanna go toss a few pennies in the fountain.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna make a wish that we stay pals forever.
LEADMALE:Oh, sweetie.
LEADFEMALE:We'll see you in the car.
OTHERFEMALE:OK, bye.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:Aren't they the greatest? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like I've been a good influence on them.
LEADMALE: Excuse me, ladies.
SUPFEMALE:I need to inspect your bag.
SUPMALE:I thought you were both asleep.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you just getting in? Because the justice system in America is an imperfect and sluggish piece of antiquated machinery.
SUPFEMALE:What? We were in the slammer.
LEADMALE:Our cute little "pals" stole some merchandise and made us the fall guys.
SUPFEMALE:We have to appear in court at noon tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:And where were you? We were calling all night.
SUPFEMALE:I was out with Eddie.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, I just got home myself.
OTHERMALE:I wonder why Sophia didn't answer.
OTHERMALE:She probably thought it was me calling and decided not to answer.
LEADMALE:It's a little guilt trick she's used on me ever since I was 15.
SUPMALE:That and having major surgery and telling me about it two days later.
LEADMALE:Sometimes she didn't even need the surgery.
LEADFEMALE:That's guilt.
SUPFEMALE:Well, the days of my mother making me feel guilty are over.
OTHERFEMALE:There is nothing wrong with my relationship with Eddie, and if my mother can't buy it, I'm very sorry, it is her problem.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, just getting in? Listen, if you three are just gonna use this place days, would you mind if I got one of those medical emergency beepers? I'd feel terrible if one morning you found me on the doorstep instead of the Miami Herald.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, it's not gonna work.
LEADFEMALE:I do not feel guilty about staying out all night and I do not feel guilty about Eddie.
SUPMALE:Don't underestimate me.
LEADFEMALE:I could make you feel guilty about bombing Pearl Harbor if I wanted.
OTHERMALE:The point is, I don't want you to feel guilty.
SUPFEMALE:There's nothing wrong with a physical relationship.
SUPMALE:Well, then, what about what you said last night? If you had let me finish my thought, Colonel Gaddafi, you might have understood.
SUPMALE:I said I thought this kind of relationship was wrong for you.
LEADMALE:Well, it's not.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, I'm your mother.
LEADMALE:I know you.
SUPMALE:You're a loving and sensitive person.
LEADFEMALE:But this isn't gonna be enough someday.
SUPMALE:You'll be bored and dissatisfied and you'll end up unhappy.
LEADMALE:I'd hate to see that happen to you, pussycat.
OTHERMALE:But if you think you can handle that, just look me straight in the eye and I'll drop the whole thing.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma I can handle that.
LEADMALE:Both eyes.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma, I hate it when you're right, and I guess I knew you were right all along.
SUPFEMALE:What are you gonna do, Dorothy? Well, I'll have to have a talk with Eddie.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it is obvious that this relationship has to taper off.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I'll end it.
OTHERMALE:Girls, I know you're gonna go to court and tell the truth.
SUPMALE:We'd like to, but we could get in some trouble.
OTHERMALE:You see, most of the judges at juvenile court know us.
OTHERMALE:I think we've worn out our cute act.
OTHERMALE:Now, you listen to me, you little monsters.
LEADFEMALE:If you think we'll be your patsies, you've have another thing coming.
LEADMALE:Maybe some cookies and milk'd change your mind.
LEADMALE:Here, how about $50 and you tell the truth.
SUPMALE:What do you say? Are you trying to bribe us? Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:You catch on quick.
LEADFEMALE:Make it 150 each.
LEADMALE:Oh, you little pirates.
OTHERMALE:All right, you've got it.
LEADMALE:Now, get out of here.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Oh, beat it! I can't believe you did that.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:That check was written on our vacation account that we closed last week.
SUPFEMALE:The bank would sooner cash a check from Jim and Tammy Bakker.
SUPFEMALE:Where are the girls? Oh, they had a sudden change of heart.
SUPMALE:They decided to confess.
SUPFEMALE: Oh, God, that's Eddie.
LEADMALE:I don't know if I can go through with this.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:We're both right beside you to help you through it.
LEADFEMALE:It's not that easy.
LEADMALE:Eddie has some kind of a strange hold over me.
OTHERFEMALE:Baloney.
LEADFEMALE:Eddie is just a man, cut from the same cloth as the many men who have dumped you over the years.
LEADMALE:Just think of him as all those men, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Become the dumper before you become the dumpee.
SUPMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna get rid of him just the way Paul Bennington got rid of me.
LEADFEMALE:The way Steve Mendlebaum got rid of me.
LEADFEMALE:The way Tom We'll be here all afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:Can you just open the door? Blanche is right.
SUPMALE:The man is history.
LEADMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Oh, Eddie, I want you so bad.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I can't help it.
SUPMALE:He looks so cute in that little suit.
LEADFEMALE:Is something wrong, Dorothy? Yes, there is something wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Eddie, we have Eddie, stop doing that with your lip.
OTHERFEMALE:Doing what? That sexy, quivering thing in the corner of your mouth.
LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to loosen up a poppy seed caught in my teeth with my tongue.
LEADMALE:Well, it's driving me crazy.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy! Come here, Eddie.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down here.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, what Dorothy is trying to tell you What's that cologne you're wearing? I'm not wearing cologne.
OTHERMALE:But that's impossible.
LEADMALE:It smells kind of like a mixture of Old Spice and musk and And a porterhouse steak? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:That's me.
LEADMALE:The smell really gets intense when I sweat.
SUPMALE:Really? Well, I'd be curious to find out just how Blanche! Blanche! Now, look here, Eddie.
LEADMALE:Now, you listen to me.
SUPMALE:Dorothy has decided she wants nothing more to do with you.
LEADMALE:I can't understand why because I think you have about the cutest ears I've ever seen on a man in my entire life.
LEADMALE:They make you kind of look like Bambi.
LEADMALE:Marry me, Eddie.
LEADFEMALE:Ladies, ladies, please! This always happens.
LEADFEMALE:I'm cursed.
OTHERFEMALE:Ever since I was a little kid, I've been absolutely irresistible to women.
OTHERMALE:I know I'm a little plain to look at No, you're not plain at all.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you're adorable.
LEADFEMALE:Cute as a button.
OTHERFEMALE:Please.
LEADMALE:Please, let me finish.
LEADMALE:I know I'm plain to look at, but everything I do seems to drive the opposite sex crazy.
LEADMALE:I don't do it on purpose.
SUPFEMALE:It just happens.
LEADFEMALE:The way I look at a woman.
LEADFEMALE:The way I make love to a woman.
LEADFEMALE:The way I kiss a woman.
SUPMALE:The way I make love to a woman.
OTHERFEMALE:You said "make love" twice.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:It's my favorite.
LEADMALE:I'm not surprised you wanted to dump me tonight
LEADMALE:the good ones always do.
LEADMALE:They always end up wanting more than just nights filled with unbridled ecstasy.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing tomorrow night? I'd better get going.
LEADMALE:I've caused enough trouble.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Eddie, can't we see each other occasionally, just as friends? It won't work.
SUPMALE:It's like trying to eat one potato chip.
OTHERMALE:Au revoir.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hello, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Eddie.
LEADMALE:Eddie, I never noticed that beauty mark on your neck.
LEADFEMALE:What beauty mark? That one! Sophia! Sophia! 
LEADFEMALE:
