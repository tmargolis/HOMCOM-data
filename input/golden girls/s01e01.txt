SUPFEMALE:I taught a class today - the finest school in Dade County.
LEADMALE:Two girls had shaved heads and three boys had green hair.
SUPFEMALE:- They're expressing themselves.
SUPFEMALE:- Well, I expressed myself.
LEADMALE:I told them they had to leave.
SUPMALE:They were too ugly to look at.
SUPMALE:Now the parents are mad.
SUPFEMALE:A father came in in a three-piece suit and defended Tiffany, a bald girl with a nose ring.
LEADMALE:- What's that? - Enchiladas rancheros.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you just shoot me? - Hi.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, hi, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:What a day.
SUPMALE:One sad person after another.
LEADMALE:Rose, you work at grief counseling.
SUPFEMALE:What do you expect, comedians? Well, it would be a change of pace.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, can I borrow your mink stole? It's Miami in June - only cats are wearing fur.
LEADFEMALE:- You going out? - No, no.
LEADFEMALE:She's gonna sit here where it's I just need some cucumbers to put on my eyes.
LEADFEMALE:You'll have trouble seeing, Blanche.
LEADMALE:It's very good.
SUPMALE:It reduces puffiness.
LEADFEMALE:Does it work on thighs? I don't know, honey.
LEADMALE:I don't need it on my thighs.
LEADFEMALE:- Who's she going out with? - Harry again.
LEADFEMALE:Harry? Who is this Harry? All Blanche said was he still has his own teeth and hair.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it is wonderful dating in Miami.
LEADMALE:All the single men under 80 are cocaine smugglers.
SUPMALE:- You know, I'd kill to be 20 again.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, I would kill to be 40 again.
LEADMALE:Oh You know, I had the shock of my life today.
SUPMALE:I was in the teacher's lounge, talking to a group of girls in their twenties.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, they were so pretty.
LEADFEMALE:At that age, you don't even have to be pretty and you're pretty.
SUPFEMALE:We were laughing and giggling and having a great time and I completely forgot that I was older.
LEADMALE:You know, I just felt like one of the girls.
SUPMALE:And we had a wonderful time.
SUPMALE:And then I got into my car and caught a glimpse of myself, and I almost had a heart attack.
LEADFEMALE:This old woman was in the mirror.
LEADMALE:I didn't even recognize her.
LEADMALE:Who was it? - It was me.
OTHERMALE:- Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Rose, I'm borrowing your earrings.
LEADMALE:Lord, I'd love to get a face-lift by 8:00.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, who is Harry? Oh, girls, he's just wonderful.
LEADMALE:He's very gallant, he's a perfect gentleman, he's a great dancer.
LEADFEMALE:And he doesn't make noises when he chews.
LEADMALE:Chewing - that's way up there on my list.
LEADFEMALE:Comes right after intelligent.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't talk loud at the movies, doesn't take his own pulse, and he's still interested.
SUPMALE:In what? Rose, if you have to ask, it does not matter anymore.
LEADFEMALE:And he proposed.
SUPMALE:Blanche, wait a minute! He proposed? You've only known him a week! - And he wants an answer tonight.
SUPMALE:- Tonight? Ton What are you gonna tell him? I don't know.
LEADMALE:He's very wonderful, but I have only known him for a week.
LEADMALE:- That's right.
OTHERMALE:- But I don't want to lose him.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, I just don't know what I'm gonna tell him.
LEADMALE:I have to go put on my face.
LEADMALE:What if she marries him? What'll happen to us? - This house is hers.
OTHERMALE:- Then we'll move.
SUPFEMALE:We can't afford to buy a house.
LEADMALE:What do we have for collateral? A gay cook? Oh, come on, Rose.
LEADMALE:Nobody is getting married.
LEADFEMALE:- Now, let's go talk to Blanche.
SUPMALE:- Dorothy, we'll become bag ladies! - Blanche? - Come in.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, Blanche, your friend Harry wants an answer tonight.
SUPFEMALE:What are you gonna tell him? I haven't decided.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess I'll know when I hear it come out of my mouth.
LEADMALE:You'll know when you hear it come out of your mouth? This isn't a belch, Blanche.
LEADMALE:This is marriage! Will you look at this? She has more colors than Benjamin Moore Paints.
LEADFEMALE:You mustn't rush into anything, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:You hardly know him.
LEADFEMALE:I just wonder what my husband George would think about me and Harry.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if he was alive, he probably would not like it.
LEADMALE:But since he's dead, I don't think it poses a problem.
SUPFEMALE:I just want him to know that I'm happy, but that I could never be as happy with Harry in the same way as I was with him.
SUPMALE:He knows, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:He knows.
SUPMALE:Your thoughts and feelings go right to him.
OTHERMALE:You can communicate directly from your heart.
SUPMALE:Can't you, Dorothy? Oh, don't ask me.
LEADFEMALE:I can't get through to New Jersey with MCI.
LEADMALE:That's him.
LEADFEMALE:He's early.
OTHERFEMALE:I haven't finished my face.
LEADFEMALE:The only thing left is to dip it in bronze.
LEADFEMALE:We'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:- I wonder what he looks like.
SUPMALE:- I hope he doesn't have hair in his ears.
SUPMALE:- Hi there.
LEADMALE:- Ma! - Ma, what's the matter? - Everyone is fine.
SUPFEMALE:No one died.
LEADFEMALE:- The home burned down.
OTHERFEMALE:- My God, are you all right? - How'd you get here? - I hitched.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, Ma! - A cab.
LEADMALE:I took a cab.
LEADMALE:Well, you should've called.
LEADFEMALE:I'm perfectly capable of managing by myself.
SUPFEMALE:I don't need help.
LEADMALE:- I'm a totally independent person.
SUPFEMALE:- I know, I know.
LEADMALE:I need $67 for the cab.
OTHERMALE:$67? Ma, Ma, this is crazy.
LEADMALE:The home is 15 minutes from here.
LEADFEMALE:My cab driver is Cuban.
OTHERMALE:He said there was an additional tax for a bilingual driver.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take care of him.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down, Sophia.
LEADMALE:You must be exhausted.
SUPFEMALE:Why? I rode in the cab.
LEADMALE:I didn't push it.
SUPMALE:Oh, Sophia, honey! How nice to see you.
SUPMALE:- Who are you? - It's me, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:You look like a prostitute.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, the things you say! She didn't mean that, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Of course I mean it.
OTHERMALE:Look at her.
LEADMALE:My cab driver would fall in love.
OTHERFEMALE:Can I get something to eat, or is the fancy man in the kitchen? - The way she talks! - She can't help it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I've known plenty of women who have had strokes.
LEADFEMALE:Some of them were in very bad shape, but they're still ladies.
LEADFEMALE:But this stroke destroyed the part of her brain that censors what she says.
SUPFEMALE:She just says whatever she thinks.
OTHERFEMALE:She can't help it.
SUPFEMALE:He's an OK petunia.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, Ma, the cab driver said you promised him a $67 tip! Don't be silly.
LEADMALE:I said a six, seven dollar tip.
SUPMALE:Why don't these people learn English if they're gonna live here? This is Miami.
LEADMALE:I'd have less trouble getting around Ecuador.
SUPMALE:- (doorbell - Oh, I'll get it.
SUPMALE:- Harry, hi! - Ah, my pretty.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Harry.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody, this is Harry.
LEADFEMALE:- Harry, this is Rose.
LEADFEMALE:- Rose.
LEADFEMALE:- And Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:- Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:- Hi, Harry.
LEADMALE:- And this is Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you must be Blanche's sister.
LEADMALE:You must be blind.
SUPFEMALE:- Sophia's home just burned down.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, that's terrible! Not to me.
OTHERMALE:It was a retirement home, and you know what they did? They set off the fire alarm in a retirement home.
LEADMALE:Who can rush? Half the people have walkers, the other half can't get out of their chairs.
LEADFEMALE:But they got bells going off like crazy.
SUPMALE:You know what that does to hearts that only beat a few times a week? It's not pretty.
SUPMALE:Uh, we'd better go.
SUPMALE:We have reservations.
LEADMALE:I hope he's taking you to a cold climate.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, ladies.
LEADMALE:It was a pleasure.
LEADFEMALE:Nice meeting you, Harry.
LEADFEMALE:Have fun! The man is a scuzzball.
LEADMALE:This is so sad.
LEADFEMALE:We were all so lonely and then by a miracle we found each other.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, we both answered an ad to share Blanche's house that we found in the supermarket.
LEADFEMALE:It was not the resurrection.
LEADFEMALE:It is hardly a miracle.
SUPFEMALE:To me it was a miracle because we're happy.
LEADMALE:It's not fair, you know.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we get married, we have kids, the kids leave, and our husbands die.
LEADFEMALE:Is that some kind of a test? You don't work that hard, you don't go through everything you go through to be left alone.
LEADFEMALE:We are alone, Dorothy, we really are.
LEADMALE:Our families are gone and we're alone.
SUPFEMALE:And there are too many years left, and I don't know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:Get a poodle.
LEADMALE:It's yes.
SUPFEMALE:I know it is.
SUPFEMALE:She's gonna marry him.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:She can't help it.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche needs a man.
LEADFEMALE:She told me, when George died, she made a date at the funeral.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, not that she didn't love George.
LEADFEMALE:She can't be without a man.
SUPFEMALE:You know what I'm saying? What am I doing up? I'm subbing for a teacher who was shot by a student.
OTHERFEMALE:I need all the sleep I can get.
SUPMALE:I used to sleep so well.
LEADFEMALE:I never even turned over.
LEADFEMALE:I'd wake up with a perfect hairdo.
OTHERMALE:Charlie, on the other hand, moves all night long.
LEADFEMALE:His side of the bed looks like a murder took place.
SUPMALE:- Rose, Charlie is dead.
SUPMALE:- Why tell her? Coco, it's 15 years! I know he's dead.
LEADMALE:I'm not crazy.
LEADMALE:I just like to talk about him in the present tense sometimes.
LEADMALE:- It makes him seem closer.
LEADFEMALE:- That's fine, Rose.
SUPMALE:You do that.
LEADMALE:- I don't mind at all.
LEADMALE:- Sure, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Set a place at the table.
SUPMALE:- Well, hi! - What happened? Oh, we had the nicest time.
LEADMALE:We went to Joe's.
LEADMALE:You ever been to Joe's? - Yes.
LEADMALE:What happened? - I had the stone crabs.
SUPMALE:I never had stone crabs.
LEADMALE:You ever have stone crabs? Yes, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Just tell us.
SUPMALE:I was just so relieved they didn't have eyes.
SUPFEMALE:I can't eat anything with eyes, like lobster.
LEADMALE:- I can't eat anything that moves.
SUPMALE:- Like what, Rose? Horses? - Like oysters.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oysters don't move! Coco, they could dance! Who cares? - Tell us.
LEADFEMALE:- Oysters move! Very slowly.
SUPMALE:You have to watch very closely.
LEADFEMALE:- Blanche, are you gonna marry Harry? - Marry Harry, marry Harry.
LEADFEMALE:- A little rhyme.
LEADFEMALE:- Knock it off.
LEADFEMALE:Are you? Yes.
LEADMALE:Next week.
SUPMALE:I knew it.
LEADMALE:I knew she was gonna marry him.
LEADMALE:But next week? At our age, long engagements don't make sense.
SUPFEMALE:I have to go to bed.
LEADFEMALE:- Where will you live? - Well, here.
OTHERFEMALE:- Where will we live? - Oh, don't worry.
OTHERMALE:We'll live, we'll live.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I hadn't thought of that.
SUPFEMALE:It's so hard to find a place to live.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, you can just stay right here.
LEADMALE:- Well, that's settled.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose! How could we stay here with Blanche and Harry? - She just said! - You certainly can until you find a place.
LEADFEMALE:However long that takes.
LEADMALE:We're going to New York for the honeymoon.
LEADFEMALE:I just hope I don't get murdered.
LEADFEMALE:Charlie and I waited two whole years before we got married.
LEADFEMALE:I got married before my father finished the sentence.
LEADMALE:You married your father? My father told Stan that he had to marry me.
LEADMALE:I was pregnant.
LEADMALE:You had a blowgun wedding? If you live in the Amazon.
SUPFEMALE:In Queens, it's called "shotgun.
LEADFEMALE:" Maybe that's why he left - because you forced him into it.
LEADMALE:Rose, he left me 38 years later.
SUPMALE:For a stewardess that he met on a business trip to Hawaii.
OTHERMALE:It was her first flight.
LEADFEMALE:They said, "On arrival, give the passengers a lei.
OTHERMALE:" She got confused He got lucky, and they now live on Maui.
LEADFEMALE:It's really wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:A 65-year-old man with gout learning to windsurf.
LEADMALE:I hope he trips on his thongs and falls into a volcano.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, it's you.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, Sophia, did we wake you? I heard noise.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought it was robbers, so I hid my jewels.
LEADFEMALE:Now I can't remember where.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you don't have any jewels.
LEADFEMALE:Thank God, because I can't find them.
OTHERFEMALE:Tea, Sophia? How about a shot of gin with a beer back? That was dumb of me to have tea this late.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go to sleep and have to get up to go.
LEADFEMALE:And wake me up.
LEADMALE:You know, if you didn't drink before bedtime, you wouldn't have to wake up in the middle of the night.
SUPMALE:I don't drink before bedtime.
SUPFEMALE:I stop all liquids at noon and I still wake up.
OTHERFEMALE:I never have that problem - never.
LEADFEMALE:I sleep like a log.
LEADFEMALE:I never get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom.
SUPFEMALE:I go in the morning.
OTHERMALE:Every morning like clockwork.
LEADMALE:At 7 am, I pee.
OTHERFEMALE:Unfortunately, I don't wake up till 8:00.
SUPFEMALE:- Where's Blanche? - In the bathroom.
LEADMALE:- I've gotta talk to you.
OTHERMALE:- What is it? I know this sounds crazy, but I'm suspicious.
LEADFEMALE:- Of what? - Harry.
LEADMALE:- Harry? - And I don't know why.
LEADFEMALE:There's just something about it I don't like, and I have to tell Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:- Tell Blanche what? - That she can't marry him! The wedding is in 12 minutes! You can't tell her that.
LEADFEMALE:I owe it to her.
LEADMALE:I'm her friend.
OTHERFEMALE:But there's nothing to tell her.
LEADMALE:This is just some crazy hunch.
SUPFEMALE:My hunches are never wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Gandhi would be alive today if she had taken my call.
LEADFEMALE:- I'm gonna tell her.
SUPFEMALE:- You are not.
LEADMALE:- I will not let you.
LEADFEMALE:- I can't stop crying.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so happy and so sad.
LEADMALE:Kind of a happy sad.
SUPFEMALE:- Speaking of sad, Blanche - Shut up, Rose.
SUPMALE:She's crying already.
LEADFEMALE:What's the difference? Rose, pick that up.
LEADMALE:I just can't believe it.
LEADMALE:I'm getting married! - What do you think about that? - I think it's a mistake.
OTHERMALE:To wear all that makeup.
OTHERMALE:I know it's fast, but I just don't know when I'll find another like him.
LEADFEMALE:He just Oh, girls, girls, he makes me feel so good, so young, so happy.
OTHERMALE:Aw.
LEADMALE:Rose, did you hear that? So happy.
LEADMALE:Now I have to go to the bathroom again.
OTHERFEMALE:When I get nervous, I have to go all the time.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I'm getting married here at the house.
SUPMALE:Public bathrooms are so difficult for me.
OTHERMALE:I wash my hands so thoroughly, and then I find it so hard to get out again without touching the doorknob.
LEADFEMALE:- Don't! - Be too long! Rose, that is a happy woman in there.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I want you to promise that you will not say anything.
LEADFEMALE:Do you promise? Are you sure? Well, what's got me so sad Ohh Oh, I just I just never, never had two better friends.
SUPMALE:I just can't stand the thought of leaving you.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Blanche, you look gorgeous.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh! Shut up, Rose.
SUPMALE:- Are you ready? - Yes, I guess.
SUPFEMALE:Stop! (thud - The minister's here.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, I need perfume.
SUPMALE:Perfume, perfume.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, let's go.
SUPMALE:- He's a half-hour late.
LEADMALE:- He probably got caught in traffic.
LEADMALE:Ladies, I'm on a tight schedule.
LEADMALE:This is Miami.
LEADFEMALE:I've got funerals backed up.
LEADMALE:Give us a few minutes, please.
LEADMALE:Five minutes more, then I've got to bury Mr.
SUPMALE:Pinkus.
SUPFEMALE:- (doorbell - You see? - Is there a Blanche Hollingsworth here? - God, he's been killed.
LEADMALE:- Arrested.
SUPMALE:- What? He gave me this to give to you.
LEADFEMALE:He's a bigamist, ma'am.
LEADMALE:He's wanted in four states.
LEADMALE:He's got six wives.
SUPMALE:You got yourself mixed up with a real hustler.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Well, you won't be needing me today.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, do you want to read the note? Do you want me to read it to you? "Dear Blanche, I guess you know by now.
SUPMALE:"I'm really sorry.
LEADFEMALE:"The thing is, I really liked you.
LEADFEMALE:"This time was different.
SUPFEMALE:You're a special lady.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe someday you'll write to me.
LEADFEMALE:Harry.
SUPFEMALE:" Oh, God.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm stunned.
LEADMALE:I'm just stunned.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:Oh, I feel like such an old fool.
OTHERFEMALE:Not just a fool, but an old fool.
LEADMALE:My God, I just wanna die.
LEADFEMALE:You're not a fool, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:You're a beautiful, loving, trusting woman.
SUPFEMALE:There's no fool here, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I guess maybe I'm hoping the shock will be too much for my heart and I'll just drop dead right here.
LEADMALE:And the minister can bury me with Mr.
OTHERMALE:Pinkus.
OTHERFEMALE:I won't have to look anyone in the eye ever again.
SUPFEMALE:Except maybe Mr.
LEADMALE:Pinkus.
LEADMALE:If I meet our paperboy, he will not live to be a paper man.
LEADFEMALE:Florida is having a drought.
LEADFEMALE:In the entire state, there is not enough water to make a cup of tea.
LEADFEMALE:He finds a puddle.
OTHERMALE:What are you doing? She's sleeping.
LEADMALE:Just checking.
OTHERFEMALE:You never know.
SUPMALE:Tell me, how is Blanche? She didn't go to work again today.
OTHERMALE:It's been three weeks and she just sits in her room.
SUPMALE:The museum's gonna fire her.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, we've tried everything - golf, the movies, theater tickets.
LEADFEMALE:She wouldn't even budge for Julio Iglesias.
SUPMALE:I know grief.
SUPMALE:It takes time.
LEADMALE:Please, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, if you're Irish, you have a wake.
SUPFEMALE:You eat, you cry, you drink, you vomit, and you're done.
LEADFEMALE:If you're Jewish, you cry, you sit, you eat for seven days, you put on ten pounds, and it's over.
SUPFEMALE:We Italians scream, dress up a donkey, hire a band, and that's that.
LEADFEMALE:It's these southern Protestants who make it a way of life.
SUPMALE:When I go, put me in a steel sack and leave me on the curb next to the cans.
LEADFEMALE:- We thought you were asleep.
LEADFEMALE:- You never know.
LEADFEMALE:You girls shouldn't sit out here in the sun.
SUPFEMALE:- We've been so worried about you.
LEADFEMALE:- I know.
LEADFEMALE:- I'm so glad you're up.
LEADMALE:- I'm sorry if I worried you.
LEADFEMALE:- Aw, sweetheart, how are you? - I'm OK.
SUPFEMALE:I really am.
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:At first I wanted to give up, to die, truly.
LEADMALE:Only time I ever felt worse was when George died.
LEADMALE:But then I had the kids with me and I pulled through it.
LEADMALE:This time, I thought, "This is my last chance, my last hope for happiness.
SUPFEMALE:" - I just thought I'd never feel good again.
LEADFEMALE:- How long is this story? I'm 80.
LEADMALE:I have to plan.
OTHERFEMALE:This morning I woke up and I was in the shower, shampooing my hair, and I heard humming.
LEADFEMALE:I thought there was someone in there with me.
LEADMALE:No, it was me.
LEADMALE:I was humming.
LEADMALE:And humming means I'm feeling good.
SUPMALE:And then I realized I was feeling good because of you.
LEADMALE:You made the difference.
LEADFEMALE:You're my family, and you make me happy to be alive.
SUPMALE:- Let's drive to Coconut Grove for lunch.
LEADMALE:- OK.
OTHERFEMALE:My treat.
SUPMALE:We have to celebrate.
LEADFEMALE:What, that she came out of her room? That we're together.
LEADFEMALE:And that no matter what happens, even if we all get married, we'll stick together.
LEADMALE:Then we'll need a much bigger house.
LEADMALE:Sure, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:After lunch, you can pick up the lumber.
LEADFEMALE:- Ma, you want to join us? - Nope.
OTHERFEMALE:- I gotta rest.
LEADFEMALE:I got a date tonight.
LEADMALE:- Huh? With whom? The fancy man and I are going to the dog track.
SUPFEMALE:- Your mother bets? - No, she rides.
OTHERMALE:She's a dog jockey.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:
