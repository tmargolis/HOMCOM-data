LEADFEMALE:Hi, Rose.
LEADMALE:We brought dinner.
LEADMALE:What'd you get?
LEADFEMALE:A bucket of chicken.
LEADMALE:I hope you like it extra flat and crispy.
LEADMALE:It's a pizza, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I knew that, I just meant what kind?
LEADFEMALE:Did you really know that?
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:But I thought I could cover.
SUPMALE:I'm glad you're all here.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to try something.
LEADMALE:Here, taste this.
SUPMALE:What do you think?
LEADFEMALE:It's water.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't ask you to identify it, I asked you what you thought.
LEADFEMALE:It's good.
LEADMALE:Just good? Very good.
OTHERMALE:How would you describe the taste?
LEADFEMALE:Refreshing, clear, clean
OTHERFEMALE:Would you buy this water?
LEADMALE:Sure, why not?
LEADMALE:Absolutely.
OTHERFEMALE:We're rich.
LEADFEMALE:We're rich.
OTHERFEMALE:It comes from the hose out back.
OTHERMALE:Move over Perrier, Petrillo water is on the way.
LEADMALE:Ma
LEADFEMALE:I know what you're gonna say.
LEADFEMALE:Another one of my get-rich-quick schemes.
OTHERFEMALE:This is different.
LEADMALE:I've been working on this since noon.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, when are you gonna learn that these money-making gimmicks of yours never work? I'm not the only one with dreams.
OTHERFEMALE:I remember when we thought catering was the ticket.
LEADFEMALE:Do you remember that?  Girls, this time I think we have really hit the jackpot.
SUPMALE:Oh, me too.
LEADMALE:This wedding consulting business is the smartest thing we've ever done.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a little nervous about tomorrow.
SUPMALE:I've never cooked for 300 people.
LEADMALE:Please, in Sicily, we did it all the time.
LEADMALE:And we didn't have the modern conveniences you have today.
LEADMALE:We had to slaughter our own meat, prepare our own seasonings, and, if the food wasn't perfect, after cappuccino, they shot the cook.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you're making that up.
LEADMALE:No, I'm not.
OTHERFEMALE:Why do you think there are only two guys from Italy?  Oh, places everybody.
SUPFEMALE:Hit it.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, this is boring.
SUPFEMALE:I know how we could make the time go faster.
SUPFEMALE:We could sing a work song, like they do on the railroad.
LEADMALE: Just follow my lead.
LEADMALE: Gonna stuff a chicken   Gonna stuff a chicken  Like my mama taught me   Like my mama taught me  Gonna take the chicken down to Mississippi  Rose.
SUPMALE:Rose, just stuff it.
LEADMALE: Who on earth could that be at 3:00 in the morning? Maybe it's a Jehovah's Witness with a caffeine problem.
OTHERMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Maybe we should go see.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Maybe we should have a weapon.
LEADMALE:Please, the three of you without make up is enough to scare anyone.
LEADMALE:Who is it?
LEADFEMALE: It's Priscilla.
LEADFEMALE:Priscilla? Priscilla! You're getting married tomorrow.
LEADMALE:You should be in bed.
SUPFEMALE:There's not gonna be a wedding.
LEADFEMALE:The hell there isn't.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, dear, you were saying? Ramone and I had a fight.
OTHERMALE:I decided I'm not gonna marry him.
OTHERMALE:Oh, honey, now that's ridiculous to call off your wedding because of a silly little argument.
LEADMALE:What did Ramone do?
LEADMALE:He slept with my best friend.
LEADMALE:We're gonna eat chicken for the rest of our lives.
LEADMALE:Oh, Priscilla, I'm so sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Listen.
OTHERMALE:Be grateful he got it out of his system before the marriage.
LEADFEMALE:It'll give you something to make him feel guilty about.
SUPFEMALE:Most women go through three, four years of marriage for ammunition like that.
OTHERMALE: Hello, Miami Mom's Catering.
LEADMALE:It's Ramone.
SUPFEMALE:Tell him he's scum of the earth.
SUPFEMALE:She says that you are the scum of the earth.
SUPFEMALE:But she said it with a lot of love in her eyes.
OTHERMALE:He says he's sorry.
LEADMALE:Do you hear that? Darling, he's sorry.
SUPMALE:So I guess that settles everything, okay? We'll see you at your wedding.
LEADFEMALE:Girls! Wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:We're talking about the sacred institution of marriage here.
SUPFEMALE:Are you willing to sacrifice the happiness of these two kids
OTHERFEMALE:for the almighty dollar?
LEADMALE: Yes.
LEADMALE:I just want to be sure we're in agreement.
LEADMALE:Ramone, I'm gonna put Priscilla on now.
SUPFEMALE:I just talk to him.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye.
SUPMALE:We're back together.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes when you really talk things out like that, you can solve anything.
LEADMALE:I can't thank you ladies enough.
SUPMALE:We're so much in love.
SUPMALE:Ramone can't even wait until tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, isn't that sweet.
SUPFEMALE:We're eloping to Las Vegas.
LEADFEMALE:You're what?
LEADMALE:He's booking the flight now.
SUPMALE:Congratulations, darling.
OTHERMALE:Congratulations? Listen, we were going to give you your wedding gift tomorrow, but since we won't see you, why don't you take it home tonight.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE: Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, are you crazy? We're gonna lose a fortune on this wedding.
LEADFEMALE:And you let her march out that door with your best piece of crystal.
SUPMALE:Hello, police? Yeah, I'd like to report a robbery.
SUPFEMALE:But that wasn't a scheme, Sophia, that was a legitimate business.
SUPMALE:And we lost our shirts.
LEADFEMALE:That's the beauty of this water thing.
LEADFEMALE:You can't lose.
LEADFEMALE:It's a rip off, pure and simple.
SUPMALE:That's why the French were first to come up with it.
OTHERFEMALE:Sophia, why are you so obsessed with money? Because I wanna buy a TV for my bedroom.
OTHERMALE:Ma, we have a perfectly good TV set in the living room.
OTHERFEMALE:But you never let me watch what I like.
LEADMALE:I wanna make sure I don't miss that final episode of MASH I've been hearing so much about.
LEADMALE:Sophia, honey, that show hasn't been on in years.
LEADMALE:Is Hotel still on? Yes.
SUPMALE:Hotel is still on and MASH isn't? How gullible do you think I am? Do I look like Donna Rice? You know, Ma, I seem to remember another time you were trying to make extra money so you could buy a TV set.
OTHERMALE:Do you happen to be talking about Brooklyn, April 1954.
LEADMALE:You remember that, but you don't know that MASH is off the air.
SUPFEMALE:Shut up and stroll with me down memory lane.
SUPMALE:I'd taken in some sewing.
OTHERMALE:It was a couple of weeks before Easter.
LEADMALE:I'm home.
OTHERMALE:Call the New York Times.
LEADFEMALE:What's for dinner? Pierre is writing today's selections on the blackboard in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE: Ow, my tooth!
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, I forgot.
LEADMALE:Stay away from the food on the table, it's wax.
LEADMALE: Hi, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I didn't know you were coming.
LEADMALE:Did you bring the kids?
LEADMALE:No, I wanted to talk to you alone.
LEADMALE:Sal, Dorothy's here.
SUPFEMALE: Did she bring the kids? Hi, Pop.
OTHERFEMALE:No, the kids are at home.
LEADFEMALE: Hey, what the hell is this? I thought dinner was in the oven.
LEADMALE:There's nothing but a tin plate.
SUPFEMALE:Take the foil off the top.
LEADFEMALE:It's something new.
SUPFEMALE:It's called a TV dinner.
OTHERFEMALE: The wax fruit looks better.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, I need to ask you a favor.
OTHERFEMALE:I wanna get a part-time job and I was wondering if you could watch the kids two days a week.
LEADMALE:Stan lost his job.
SUPFEMALE:I told you that yutz is a deadbeat.
LEADFEMALE:Stan did not lose his job.
LEADMALE:His job, he could afford to lose.
LEADMALE:A novelty salesman.
OTHERMALE:The novelty would be if he made a sale.
LEADMALE: Don't listen to your mother.
LEADMALE:There's a big market for novelties.
SUPFEMALE:That plastic dog doo we snuck into Charlie's lunch pail, was a scream.
LEADMALE:I'll bet his cocker spaniel will catch hell for that tonight.
LEADMALE:Lucky me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm married to the Noel Coward of Canarsie.
OTHERMALE:I just want to pick up a couple of extra dollars so we can buy a television set.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:What? No, I won't watch the kids.
SUPMALE:But you love it when the kids come over for a visit.
OTHERFEMALE:That's not the point.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't throw away money.
OTHERMALE:This TV thing is just a fad.
SUPMALE: Hey, did you know this turkey comes with stuffing? Ma, TV is not a fad.
LEADFEMALE:Otherwise Swanson would have called those radio dinners.
SUPMALE:I told you, no.
LEADFEMALE: I didn't know these were mashed potatoes.
LEADMALE:They don't have lumps like yours.
LEADMALE:You want lumps, Salvadore, I'll give you lumps.
LEADMALE:Ma, I cannot believe you are so old-fashioned in your thinking.
LEADFEMALE:I said no and it's no.
SUPMALE:I'm too busy to have this argument.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just leave the kids with Stan's mother.
LEADMALE:Over my dead body.
LEADFEMALE:That gorilla scares the children.
LEADMALE:Michael didn't sleep for a week after he saw her last time.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, that is enough.
SUPMALE:One way or another, I am going to earn that money for the TV.
SUPFEMALE: Sophia, would you just tell her so your husband can enjoy his meal in peace.
LEADMALE:Tell me what?
LEADMALE: These peas taste like fresh.
LEADFEMALE:But you can't mix them with the mashed potatoes.
SUPFEMALE:They should have a tunnel running from the pea compartment to the mashed potato compartment.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, what is Pop talking about? What should you tell me? All right, all right.
LEADMALE:It's your tenth anniversary, your father and I decided to buy you a TV set as a gift.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, you can't afford that.
LEADMALE:That's why I'm doing alterations.
LEADMALE:Think I need a wardrobe this size to go to Mulberry Street and squeeze a zucchini?  Oh, Ma.
SUPMALE:What's so funny? I lied.
SUPFEMALE:I wanted the job so we could buy Pop a TV for his birthday.
LEADFEMALE:Then it's settled.
LEADMALE:You buy us one, we'll buy you one.
LEADFEMALE:It's a deal.
OTHERMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Then your father can watch the Friday night fights with your yutz of a husband, you come here and watch Person to Person with me, and maybe once a week the whole family can come over and watch that new show, Make Room for Daddy.
SUPMALE:Thanks, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you going?
OTHERMALE:Get some air.
SUPMALE:We got air in the house.
SUPMALE:I like beer with my air.
LEADMALE: You wait up for me?
LEADMALE:Don't I always?
LEADMALE: I love you.
LEADMALE:I love you, too.
SUPFEMALE:I look at him, I see Errol Flynn.
SUPMALE:That pizza was delicious.
LEADFEMALE:The best.
LEADMALE:There's still one piece left, who wants it?
SUPMALE:I do.
LEADFEMALE:I do.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I can split it three ways.
OTHERMALE:What am I supposed to do, lick the box? Ma, you don't like store bought pizza, you prefer homemade.
LEADFEMALE:I also prefer milk straight from a cow.
SUPMALE:I adapt.
LEADMALE:This is awful.
SUPMALE:Ma, if you weren't going to eat it, why did you take it? It's the principle.
LEADMALE:You're always leaving me out of things.
SUPFEMALE:Now, Sophia, that's not true.
LEADFEMALE:The hell it isn't.
SUPFEMALE:What about that dance marathon you cut me out of? Oh, now, come on, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:That was different.
LEADFEMALE:There was money at stake.
OTHERMALE:We didn't even tell each other about that.
LEADMALE:I remember I was the first one to arrive, remember? And I was wearing that blue sequined dress  Will you quit complaining, Marty? It's gonna be fun.
LEADMALE:You said we're going dancing tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:You failed to mention it was a dance marathon.
SUPFEMALE:Well, the first prize is $1000 and I have to have that money.
LEADMALE:I'm in desperate need of medical attention.
SUPFEMALE:Is it serious?
LEADMALE:Very.
LEADMALE:If I can't afford a new fall wardrobe, I'll never land myself a doctor.
SUPMALE:No offense, Marty.
SUPMALE:You know, sometimes I don't think you're serious about me.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be silly.
SUPFEMALE:I love you as much as I could any dry cleaner.
LEADMALE:Run and get us a number.
LEADMALE:Go on.
LEADMALE:Why, hello there, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Russ, hi.
OTHERMALE:What are you all doing here? Russell and I just entered the dance marathon.
SUPFEMALE:Really, so did I.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:It's for charity.
SUPMALE:I thought it would be fun.
SUPMALE:Well, have yourself a good time.
SUPMALE:Try not to overdo it.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, what is that supposed to mean? Oh, nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Just that these things can be a little strenuous for a woman of your years.
OTHERFEMALE:Who am I, Minnie Eisenhower? I can last just as long as you can.
OTHERFEMALE: Oh, Dorothy, please.
LEADMALE:I think I do have a little more endurance than you.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, we are not dancing on our backs.
LEADFEMALE:You take that back.
LEADFEMALE:I will not.
SUPFEMALE:You just implied that I'm an old lady.
LEADMALE:Well, honey, I didn't mean to imply it.
SUPFEMALE:I meant to say it flat out.
LEADFEMALE:You know what your problem is? You can't stand a little competition.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Which is why you kept this a secret.
SUPFEMALE:I notice you're here too, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:So you tried to keep it a secret from me.
SUPMALE:Hi, girls.
LEADFEMALE:Et tu, Judas? No, it's me, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:My hair is a little different.
SUPMALE:You two found out about this thing too?
OTHERMALE:Mm-hmm.
SUPMALE:That's right.
SUPFEMALE:Let give you a little friendly advice.
SUPFEMALE:You're wasting your time.
LEADMALE:'Cause that thousand dollar prize is gonna be mine.
LEADFEMALE:When I was younger, I was known as the dancing fool.
LEADFEMALE:How old were you when they dropped the "dancing" part?  Yowza, yowza, yowza, ladies and gentlemen.
OTHERFEMALE:And welcome to the thirteenth annual Jefferson Hospital Heart Charity Dance Marathon.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE: One word of caution before we begin.
LEADMALE:Contrary to what some folks thought last year, this marathon is not part of the Cardiac Rehabilitation program here at the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:So, if any of you toe tappers have more than 30 percent blockage, we implore you to leave the dance floor at this time.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, now.
SUPFEMALE:Let's let the dance marathon begin! A one, two, three, four.
LEADMALE: Blanche, you're not gonna believe this.
LEADMALE:I twisted my ankle.
SUPFEMALE:I can't dance.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, no, you have to.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe you'd force me to dance all night in pain.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, if you win, you said you were gonna take all the money.
SUPFEMALE:What do I get out of this evening?
LEADMALE:Come here.
LEADFEMALE:Let's samba.
LEADMALE:  Ladies and gentlemen, our charity dance marathon is now entering its seventh hour.
LEADMALE:Let's give our contestants a great big hand.
LEADMALE: Hi, girls, how are you holding up?
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, fine, just fine.
LEADMALE:Terrific.
LEADMALE:You know, this reminds me of the big dance back in St.
SUPFEMALE:Olaf to kick off Pretzel Week.
LEADFEMALE:My Uncle Gunther, after the great beer nut shortage of '21 Foul! Send a judge over here.
LEADFEMALE:This woman is trying to put us to sleep.
SUPFEMALE:You're just exhausted and you're trying to blame it on me.
LEADMALE:Exhausted? I'll show you who's exhausted.
SUPFEMALE:Maestro.
LEADFEMALE:How about something with a little octane.
SUPMALE:Okay, little lady.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, boys! Take it away! A one, two, a one, two, three, four.
LEADFEMALE:  Out of my way, amateurs.
LEADMALE: Blanche, mind if I give it a try? Oh, for heaven's sake, go on.
SUPFEMALE:No, Dave, I better do this by myself.
SUPFEMALE:You might get hurt.
SUPMALE:Three, four   It looks like it's going to be a long night.
LEADMALE: Ladies and gentlemen, a nice round of applause for our four remaining couples as we enter lucky hour number 13.
LEADFEMALE:  And a special round of applause for spunky Nick Montavesti.
LEADFEMALE:He outran enemy fire at Iwo Jima, but phlebitis is the enemy he couldn't outrun tonight.
LEADFEMALE:And now, it's time to tango.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Blanche, I can't.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I can't go on.
SUPFEMALE:No, you have to.
SUPMALE:Just a little while longer and I'll have that thousand.
LEADMALE:And you will have a wonderful story to tell your poker club.
SUPMALE:No, I'm sorry, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I quit.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you dare.
OTHERFEMALE:No, I quit.
LEADFEMALE:No, I quit.
SUPMALE:Marty! Uh-oh, ladies and gentlemen, it looks like couple 29 is out of the competition.
OTHERFEMALE:And that little lady on the dance floor is out too unless she can find a new partner within the next minute.
SUPFEMALE: Oh, yeah? Excuse me, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Listen.
SUPMALE:Would you consider dumping your partner and dancing with me Listen, sir.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Would you consider it if I  Dorothy, Dorothy! I got a charlie horse.
SUPMALE:I can't make it.
OTHERMALE:Shake it off, wimp! I can't.
LEADMALE:Russell, come back.
LEADFEMALE:Come back here.
SUPFEMALE:Come back here! Russell! Looks like it's just you and me, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Rose, I'm afraid I have to leave.
SUPFEMALE:Are you in pain?
SUPMALE:I will be if my wife catches me and she just walked in.
OTHERMALE:David! David! Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like we have a winner.
OTHERMALE:Couple number 29! That's me.
SUPFEMALE:I won.
LEADMALE:I won! I won! I won! Just a minute, it's not over yet.
LEADFEMALE:It looks like we have another couple re-entering the floor.
LEADMALE:I will never forget the look on your face when Dorothy and I tangoed on to the floor.
LEADMALE:And I will never forget the look on your faces when you were disqualified and I won the thousand dollars.
SUPFEMALE:And it was so sporting of you to share your winnings.
SUPFEMALE:With my $10 I got that can opener I always wanted.
LEADMALE:Don't say no, just hear me out.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think I'm cute?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Just answer.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Ma, I think you're cute.
LEADMALE:Would you say cute verging on adorable? Sophia, what's this all about? Just picture my face on this jar filled with my tomato sauce.
LEADMALE:We could put Paul Newman out of business.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, if you had your choice of a spaghetti sauce with your picture on it or Paul Newman's picture on it, which would you choose? Back to square one.
LEADFEMALE:
