LEADFEMALE:I'll set these down and show you through the house.
LEADMALE:You didn't have to wait outside.
OTHERMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:It's OK, fella.
LEADFEMALE:I don't mind if I do.
LEADMALE:Nice place you got here.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADMALE:Can I offer you something? Coffee? Tea? Scraps from last night's dinner? Oh, you're pulling my tail.
SUPFEMALE:Aren't you a little old for imaginary friends? Sophia, I wasn't talking to myself.
OTHERFEMALE:I was talking to the dog.
LEADFEMALE:My Auntie Bet talked to woodpeckers.
LEADFEMALE:He's adorable.
SUPMALE:I found him at the market.
LEADFEMALE:I'll keep him till I find his owner.
LEADFEMALE:Find his owner before Dorothy gets home.
OTHERMALE:She hates dogs.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, look at the cute little puppy dog.
LEADFEMALE:Hello there, honey.
SUPMALE:He likes me.
OTHERMALE:He must be a male.
OTHERMALE:Then you don't mind if he stays till I find his owner? Mind? Of course I mind.
LEADMALE:You can't keep that filthy beast in my house.
LEADFEMALE:But you said he was cute.
LEADMALE:He is.
LEADFEMALE:But a dog belongs outdoors in his natural habitat where he's free to roam and lick himself in the privacy of his doghouse.
SUPMALE:He won't be any trouble.
SUPMALE:I'll keep him in my room.
SUPMALE:You won't know he's here.
OTHERFEMALE:OK, but we're not the only ones living here.
SUPMALE:Dorothy has to agree, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:If he lifts his leg, I'll rub your nose in it.
SUPFEMALE:That seems fair.
SUPFEMALE:Bye, Auntie Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, Auntie Sophia.
LEADMALE:She gets away with it.
LEADMALE:If she was my age she'd be locked up making boats out of sticks.
LEADFEMALE:I've had it.
LEADMALE:I've just had it.
SUPMALE:In the past few days I've been turned down for every available part-time job in Dade County that didn't involved selling cocaine.
SUPMALE:Oh, Dorothy, it's just so unfair.
LEADFEMALE:They shouldn't do this to a fine teacher like you.
LEADMALE:It's part of the experimental year-round school system.
LEADMALE:Every teacher is required to take a ten-week leave and my ten weeks are now.
SUPMALE:You should've taken the job I suggested.
SUPMALE:Ma, you wanted me to be a nun.
LEADMALE:It's steady work, they supply the uniform and you're married to God.
LEADFEMALE:At least he's home every night.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe it's time you reconsidered working at the museum with me.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, we've had that conversation.
OTHERFEMALE:All I know about museums is not to eat the veal in the cafeteria.
SUPFEMALE:You can't find a job and you need the money.
LEADMALE:It might be fun working together.
LEADFEMALE:Well
OTHERFEMALE:I won't take no for an answer.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll set up an interview with Mr Allen tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:What was that? Rose found a dog at the supermarket.
LEADMALE:Couldn't she get stew meat like she usually does? Dorothy, don't be upset.
OTHERMALE:The poor thing was lost.
LEADFEMALE:He followed me home.
LEADFEMALE:You drive to the market.
SUPMALE:Did he follow you in a taxi? He looked so hungry and sad.
SUPMALE:I couldn't just leave him.
SUPFEMALE:I hunted hours for his owner.
LEADMALE:I hate dogs, Rose.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, come on.
LEADMALE:Nobody hates dogs.
LEADFEMALE:Please, just for the night.
LEADFEMALE:I promise.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, Auntie Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I won't be any trouble.
SUPFEMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:But just for the night.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Auntie Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Well, do you believe this? I saw her lips move.
OTHERMALE:I took several art courses in college and I've also substituted in art appreciation classes in the public school system.
LEADMALE:Mr Allen, Dorothy was telling you about her background.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, I'm distracted.
LEADMALE:It's not every day you find your friend in bed with your wife.
LEADMALE:I'm so sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:That must have been quite a shock.
LEADFEMALE:It was.
SUPMALE:Arthur's never come home at lunch before.
LEADFEMALE:He caught me red-handed.
LEADMALE:Now, where were we?
SUPFEMALE:We were talking about art.
LEADMALE:The thing we hang on the wall here.
LEADMALE:What about it?
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy knows a lot about it.
LEADFEMALE:She studied in Rome and lectured in Paris and she has a very keen eye for colour and light and form.
OTHERFEMALE:She's always the first one to compliment me on my wardrobe.
LEADMALE:Blanche thinks highly of you.
OTHERMALE:She's taking my résumé to the Vatican this afternoon.
OTHERMALE:Pardon? That's just a little joke to ease the tension of the moment.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:I tried to think of something funny to say when Art walked in.
LEADMALE:But standing there in my shorts, nothing came to mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mr Allen.
LEADMALE:Does Dorothy get the job?
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Mr Allen.
LEADFEMALE:I hope I live up to your expectations.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:That's a boy.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, why are you up so early? Never mind.
OTHERMALE:It's over a week.
SUPFEMALE:Why is that mutt still here? I promised to take him to the pound, but he wasn't well.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm a little worried.
LEADMALE:Don't be, it was a hangover.
LEADFEMALE:What?
SUPFEMALE:A hangover from the sherry.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you gave the dog sherry? That's terrible.
LEADMALE:I was having a few sips while I rinsed out my underwear.
SUPMALE:It's a little thing I do Mondays and Thursdays.
SUPMALE:Anyway, the dog walks in, looks at me, and it's your Uncle Aldo's face begging for a drink.
OTHERFEMALE:I give him a swallow, but he doesn't know when to stop, also like Aldo.
LEADMALE:We sing some Puccini, stretch out on the couch and take a nap.
SUPMALE:All in all, a pleasant afternoon.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, the dog is drooling on my foot.
SUPFEMALE:You say that like it's a bad thing.
LEADMALE:Rose, we had an agreement.
LEADMALE:You said the dog would be gone by now.
LEADMALE:Just one more day, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I'll find the owner.
LEADFEMALE:I have posters all over the neighbourhood.
OTHERMALE:One more day or I'll get rid of the dog myself.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll take him out to the lanai.
LEADMALE:Come on, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:Auntie Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Lighten up.
SUPFEMALE:Morning.
SUPFEMALE:Morning, Auntie Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:The pup's still here.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:One more day, unless Ma takes him bar hopping.
SUPMALE:How come you're dressed so early? I told Mr Allen I'd come in early to get the press list information ready before lunch.
LEADFEMALE:You're such a treasure.
LEADFEMALE:I hope he appreciates you.
OTHERMALE:After only a week you know as much about that museum as I do.
LEADMALE:What's to know? Bang in a nail, hang a picture.
LEADMALE:Any idiot could do that.
SUPMALE:Stop bragging.
LEADMALE:You're only saying that cos I'm your daughter.
SUPMALE:I'm very proud of the job you're doing, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Hello? Just a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Mr Allen on the phone.
OTHERFEMALE:He's never called me at home before.
OTHERMALE:And he's not now.
LEADFEMALE:It's for Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, Mr Allen.
SUPMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, thank you very much.
LEADMALE:Very sweet of you to call.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you so much.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you later.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:What did he want?
LEADFEMALE:To thank me for my work on the Hotchkiss project.
LEADFEMALE:That's lovely.
SUPMALE:Just lovely.
SUPFEMALE:Especially since there wasn't that much work involved.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, it's 8 a.
SUPMALE:m.
SUPMALE:What are you doing with the sherry? I'm not gonna drink it.
LEADFEMALE:I was hiding it from the dog.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you expect me to believe that? Promise me you won't drive.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, look who I found.
LEADMALE:Ma.
OTHERMALE:What are you doing here?
LEADMALE:You left your lunch at home.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't have to come.
OTHERFEMALE:Good excuse to put my teeth in.
LEADMALE:While you're here, would you like a tour? No.
LEADMALE:If I want to look at pictures, I go to FotoMatt.
SUPFEMALE:Rose brought me.
LEADFEMALE:She's outside with the dog.
OTHERFEMALE:You ever stick your head out of a car window doing 50? What a rush.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:And who do we have here? This is my mother Sophia Petrillo.
LEADMALE:Ma, this is my boss Mr Allen.
LEADMALE:Pleased to meet you, Mrs Petrillo.
LEADFEMALE:What brings you to our humble home? Is he gay? Come on, I'll walk you to the car.
LEADMALE:Goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry you didn't have an opportunity to experience our museum.
LEADFEMALE:I'd love for you to see my most prized acquisition.
SUPMALE:A magnificent pair of Gauguins.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you, a pervert? I was married 45 years.
LEADFEMALE:I never even saw my husband's Gauguins.
LEADFEMALE:I forgot why I came to talk to you.
OTHERMALE:About the banquet.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you worry about a thing.
LEADMALE:I love to throw a party.
LEADFEMALE:Leave it to me.
LEADMALE:Actually, I've decided to leave everything to Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me?
LEADMALE:I've put Dorothy in charge of the arrangements for the banquet.
OTHERMALE:You won't have to do a thing.
OTHERMALE:You'll have your time free to devote to the exhibition.
SUPFEMALE:But, Mr Allen, I'd always assumed that I was gonna handle it.
LEADMALE:You were, but that was before we found Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell her I want to see her.
LEADMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy isn't here.
SUPMALE:She was arrested on a morals charge this morning.
LEADMALE:You never know, do you? Have a nice day.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, gimme a break.
SUPMALE:The Di-Gel's on the bottom shelf.
LEADFEMALE:You.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:That does it.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, out.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Out.
SUPFEMALE:Move it.
LEADFEMALE:Out.
LEADFEMALE:Right now.
LEADMALE:Come on, now, this isn't fair.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:I'm not falling for those big sad eyes and floppy ears and wet nose.
LEADMALE:The last time I did, it ended in divorce.
LEADFEMALE:Stan couldn't even catch a Frisbee in his teeth.
LEADFEMALE:Listen.
LEADMALE:Honey, it's not a personal thing.
LEADFEMALE:I don't hate you.
OTHERFEMALE:As a matter of fact, I once had a dog.
LEADFEMALE:A schnauzer name Wa-Wa.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, I know that sounds strange, but my daughter was only two when she named him during a walk.
LEADMALE:And I figured between that and Number One, Wa-Wa was the hands-down winner.
OTHERMALE:He was the greatest dog in the world.
LEADMALE:Present company excluded.
LEADFEMALE:I loved that dog.
LEADFEMALE:He was always with me.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I'd never be able to get along without him.
SUPFEMALE:And one day he died.
LEADFEMALE:I cried for a week.
SUPMALE:And I decided then I would never ever go through that again.
SUPMALE:So, you see, it's not My God.
LEADFEMALE:I've spilled my guts to someone who drinks out of a toilet.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I'm sorry, you are out of here.
OTHERFEMALE:One Wa-Wa in my life was enough.
LEADMALE:Look, I've had it with that disgusting dog.
SUPMALE:I've tolerated him as long as I can.
OTHERMALE:He's got to go.
LEADMALE:But, Dorothy
LEADMALE:No "buts", Rose.
SUPMALE:OK, I'll need a few more days.
SUPFEMALE:A few more days and that is it.
LEADMALE:Get me a doggie bone.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
OTHERMALE:I don't think you deserve one.
SUPFEMALE:Not for me.
SUPFEMALE:It's to lure that mutt out of my room.
LEADFEMALE:That's OK.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get him out.
SUPFEMALE:Aunt Dorothy's certainly a grouch.
LEADMALE:You couldn't sleep either, huh? No, I guess it's the knife in my back.
LEADFEMALE:Come again? I wasn't going to mention this, but I won't be able to sleep until I do.
SUPMALE:You have backed me into a corner.
LEADFEMALE:When that happens, I come out fighting like a wild cat.
LEADFEMALE:Unless I'm drunk.
SUPFEMALE:I slide down the wall and make passionate love on the carpet.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, what the hell are you talking about? You stole the banquet of the only art show I've ever put together.
LEADFEMALE:I did not steal your banquet.
LEADFEMALE:Mr Allen assigned it to me.
SUPMALE:Why? Why give it to you and not to me? I've been working there for five years.
SUPFEMALE:I'm the one who's been wearing low-cut blouses and picking up pencils off the floor.
OTHERMALE:I'm the one he always gropes at the Christmas party.
SUPFEMALE:And they picked Sandra Day O'Connor over you? I'm not taking this sitting down.
LEADMALE:When it comes to art, you cannot hold a candle to me.
SUPMALE:Give me back my banquet before you mess it up.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, Mr Allen gave me that banquet and I'll take charge of it, regardless of your childish insecurities.
OTHERMALE:Who are you calling childish?
SUPMALE:Who did you call back-stabber? Girls, this little fella better stick around a while.
SUPMALE:Get rid of him.
LEADFEMALE:He's ill.
LEADFEMALE:Who cares? Don't explain, Rose.
LEADMALE:I lived with some bitches myself.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, is Blanche around?
OTHERMALE:She hasn't come in yet.
LEADFEMALE:Good, we can talk about the banquet.
OTHERMALE:How's everything going?
SUPFEMALE:She doesn't suspect a thing.
OTHERMALE:I can't wait to see her face when she sees the banquet is to honour her good work.
SUPFEMALE:I can't either.
SUPFEMALE:I'll finish my speech for Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:When it's done, would you look at it? I'd be happy to, Mr Allen.
LEADMALE:Be happy to, Mr Allen.
LEADMALE:My, aren't we licking boots a little early? I had a light breakfast.
SUPMALE:Here's your mail.
OTHERFEMALE:Why not tell me what's in it? What? Haven't you already steamed it open? Please, I have a lot of work to get done before lunch.
LEADFEMALE:Don't let little ineffectual, insignificant me
OTHERMALE:get between you and your work.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't want to come between your lips and Mr Allen's behind.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, that does it, I have had it.
LEADMALE:Up until we started working together, you were my best friend.
LEADFEMALE:We were good friends because you trusted me.
SUPMALE:Now you think I'm some other person, someone who'd stab you in the back.
LEADFEMALE:I am not that person.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I am still your best friend, whether or not you think so.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I I've been acting like such a fool.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what in the hell got into me.
SUPFEMALE:I know you'd never hide anything behind my back.
SUPFEMALE:Please forgive me, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Please, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
SUPMALE:You really hurt my feelings.
SUPMALE:I I don't know.
LEADMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:This is tearing me up.
LEADMALE:I'm a mess.
SUPFEMALE:You can't tell from the way I look, but it's true.
OTHERMALE:OK, Blanche.
SUPMALE:I forgive you.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, I've got the thing I want you to look over.
LEADMALE:The thing.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll look at it later.
LEADMALE:So, where would you like to have lunch? How about that new pizza place on the corner?
OTHERFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes? What was that thing Mr Allen just gave you?
LEADMALE:What thing?
OTHERMALE:That thing in your drawer.
SUPFEMALE:That thing.
SUPFEMALE:It's nothing.
LEADMALE:If it's nothing, let me see it.
SUPMALE:I am really hungry.
SUPMALE:Let's go out and get that pizza now.
SUPFEMALE:It's 9.
LEADFEMALE:15.
SUPMALE:I don't want pizza, I want to see that.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, Blanche, you can't.
OTHERFEMALE:Why?
LEADFEMALE:Because.
OTHERMALE:Why? Because it's none of your business.
OTHERMALE:None of my business? I will have you know that before you came here, everything was my business.
LEADFEMALE:Show me that paper.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Blanche, I can't.
LEADFEMALE:I knew you'd been hiding something.
OTHERMALE:You no-good, back-stabbing jezebel.
SUPFEMALE:I demand you show me that paper.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, flattery won't work.
OTHERMALE:I'll tell you what won't work.
OTHERFEMALE:You and me in the same office.
OTHERMALE:Stealing that banquet was bad enough, but hiding things is going too far.
LEADMALE:If you want this job that bad that you have to lie, you can have it.
LEADFEMALE:I quit.
SUPFEMALE:Gin.
SUPMALE:Aren't you gonna get mad?
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Want to play again? Nah.
SUPFEMALE:If you don't get mad, it's no fun.
SUPFEMALE:You still upset about Blanche?
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Ma.
LEADMALE:Tell her that cockamamie banquet is for her.
OTHERMALE:I can't, I was sworn to secrecy.
LEADMALE:Hi, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Eat dirt and die, trash.
LEADFEMALE:Just hold it right there, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:You stay out of this, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:That banquet you're mad about is in your honour.
LEADFEMALE:What?
SUPFEMALE:I told you, it was a secret.
LEADFEMALE:Your secret, not mine.
OTHERMALE:Is this true?
LEADFEMALE:Yes, it is.
SUPMALE:Now you feel like the dirt you wanted her to eat, I think I'll have a hard candy.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, I I don't know what to say.
LEADFEMALE:I understand, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, you don't.
LEADFEMALE:See, I thought I was a miracle worker, that nobody could do what I do at the museum.
LEADFEMALE:Then you came and learned my job in a week and I realised any idiot can do it.
SUPFEMALE:And you were afraid you couldn't find the right words to apologise.
LEADFEMALE:There are no right words, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Words cannot begin to ease the pain I've inflicted on you.
LEADFEMALE:But I want to make it up to you.
LEADMALE:I want to give you something personal, something from the heart.
SUPFEMALE:The most beautiful thing I own, to the most beautiful person I know.
LEADMALE:I guess that would be my emerald earrings.
SUPMALE:I'm sure as hell not gonna give you those.
LEADMALE:But I want to give you something.
LEADMALE:Something personal.
SUPMALE:I know, how about a personal cheque for $ 75? On the bottom I'll write, "I was a big fat jerk.
SUPMALE:" Blanche, I don't want your cheque I am trying to find some way to tell you I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:OK, I'll take it but I won't cash it.
LEADMALE:I'll keep it as a reminder for the next time you behave like a big fat jerk.
LEADMALE:OK.
SUPFEMALE:Will you be able to pretend to be surprised at that banquet? Of course.
LEADMALE:I've pretended to be a virgin enough times.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, I've got great news.
SUPMALE:I found the dog's owner.
LEADFEMALE:How did you know? He recognised the picture.
SUPMALE:And the dog came to him when he called.
SUPFEMALE:That's wonderful.
SUPMALE:I'm so glad he found his owner.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, why, are you crying? No, I just have something in my eye.
LEADFEMALE:That's dog love in your eyes.
LEADMALE:All right, I admit it.
LEADFEMALE:I love dogs.
SUPMALE:It just breaks my heart that that dog is gone.
SUPFEMALE:I felt the same when I dropped him off.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I stopped at the animal shelter.
OTHERMALE:Come on in, guys.
LEADMALE:Come on, guys.
OTHERFEMALE:
