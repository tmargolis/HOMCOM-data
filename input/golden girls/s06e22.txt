LEADMALE:Well, I'm off.
LEADMALE:That would be my diagnosis.
LEADMALE:No, I mean I'm going out.
OTHERMALE:Ma, put down the binoculars.
LEADFEMALE:No, I need them.
LEADFEMALE:I lost my glasses, and I'm not supposed to drive without them.
SUPMALE:Let's analyze this for a moment.
OTHERFEMALE:You're now what, about 200 years old? About.
LEADMALE:You have no license.
SUPFEMALE:You're not allowed to drive.
LEADMALE:Curses! Dorothy, good, I'm glad you're here.
LEADMALE:I want you to help me go through these papers.
SUPMALE:They're to authenticate my family tree.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Tomorrow I have to present it out loud at the "Daughters of the Old South" initiation banquet.
SUPFEMALE:You're not really gonna go through with this, are you? Well, indeed I am.
OTHERFEMALE:This club is a link to the proudest of all heritages.
LEADFEMALE:I remember, growin' up in Atlanta, how us girls used to pretend to be Confederate belles, and we'd receive gentleman callers.
OTHERMALE:Got to be like a competition.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, I once received seven callers in one evening.
LEADMALE:I'm just thinking out loud, but isn't Atlanta where the Center for Disease Control is? Coincidence.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, these are all right.
SUPMALE:When I look through them backwards, you actually look demure.
SUPMALE:Ma, get new glasses, all right?  Why must you always make such a big deal out of everything? Who's making a big deal out of it? I'm not making a big deal out of it.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi! Hi, Barbara.
LEADFEMALE:We got a call at the police station about lost glasses.
LEADFEMALE:You got my message.
LEADFEMALE:How many men you got on this? Well, none really.
SUPFEMALE:I did check, and nobody reported any lost glasses.
SUPMALE:Not lost.
LEADFEMALE:Stolen.
OTHERMALE:I want cops on this.
LEADMALE:Big, burly, steroid-crazed cops.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Sophia.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, fine, get one for Blanche, too.
LEADMALE:Throw it on my tab.
LEADMALE:As long as I'm here, I should tell you there's been complaints from the neighbors about the noise at night.
LEADMALE:Which neighbors? Well, me.
LEADMALE:Which noise? Well, you.
OTHERMALE:Well, get earmuffs.
OTHERFEMALE:I pay my taxes.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, Rose, another date with Karl tonight, huh? You must really like this guy.
SUPFEMALE:I do.
LEADMALE:Karl is sweet, and he's supportive.
LEADMALE:He understands that I still have feelings for Miles.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, Miles is in the Witness Relocation Program.
LEADFEMALE:You're not supposed to be telling people about him.
LEADMALE:I didn't tell him Miles ratted on a gangster named The Cheeseman.
SUPMALE:He just knows there's somebody I can't see anymore.
LEADMALE:Oh, Karl is quite a guy.
LEADMALE:Lately I've been dreaming about him at night, not Miles.
SUPFEMALE:Although I do have one dream that both Karl and Miles are in.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh.
LEADFEMALE:And? OK.
SUPMALE:And Captain Kangaroo.
LEADMALE:Oh, and look here, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:This is my grandmother Marcelle Daboval.
LEADFEMALE:Pure Southern, through and through.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't like the idea of this club.
SUPMALE:It seems so discriminatory.
LEADFEMALE:There is nothing wrong with being proud of what you are.
LEADMALE:This club celebrates those individuals who can prove they come from 100% Southern Confederate stock.
OTHERMALE:And if you can't, then fiddle-di-doo to you.
SUPMALE:Do you have any idea how much that hurts? Ladies and gentlemen, Roy Orbison.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, where did you get those glasses? They're an old pair of Pop's, but at least they've got prescription lenses.
OTHERFEMALE:You can't possibly see through them.
SUPMALE:Take them off before you hurt yourself.
LEADFEMALE:No, they're great.
LEADMALE:I see just fine.
OTHERMALE:Who's the black guy? I'm about done with this side of the family tree.
LEADFEMALE:I think you have the papers there from the Roquet marriage.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, here.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
SUPFEMALE:Walker Roquet married Rosalyn Roquet, 1861.
SUPMALE:Rosalyn was fro- Uh-oh.
LEADFEMALE:What? I hate telling you this, Blanche No, that's not true.
SUPMALE:I look forward to telling you this, Blanche.
SUPMALE:The woman your great-grandfather married was born, well, outside of Georgia.
OTHERMALE:How far outside of Georgia? Buffalo.
SUPFEMALE:You're a Yankee, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, no, this can't be.
LEADFEMALE:A Yankee Doodle.
SUPMALE:There must be some mistake.
LEADFEMALE:You are that Yankee Doodle gal.
LEADFEMALE:Let me see the certificate.
SUPFEMALE:I want to see with my own eyes that my great-grandmother was that thing you said.
LEADMALE:A Yankee.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:A Yankee Doodle.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, stop it.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, did I mention her last name was Feldman? Aw, no.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, no, no.
LEADMALE:No, it can't be.
OTHERMALE:I can't be Jewish.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be damned.
LEADFEMALE:The black guy is prejudiced.
LEADMALE:This information will have no bearing on my getting into the "Daughters of the Old South.
OTHERFEMALE:" I'll just lie.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, this is ridiculous.
LEADMALE:Why should you have to lie? You're only one-eighth Yankee.
LEADMALE:That's right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm seven-eighths' Southern.
SUPFEMALE:That's more than enough.
LEADFEMALE:And if they don't let you in, instead of saying "fiddle-di-doo," well, you can always switch to Deedle didle deedle dum Thanks for a lovely evening, Karl.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, I've got an idea.
LEADMALE:What do you say we go away for the weekend? Karl, I'm not sure I'm ready to.
SUPMALE:It's because of this Miles guy, right? I don't want to push you, but I just wish I knew what I was up against.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, who is this guy? What did he do? Where is he now? I wish I could tell you, but I really don't know anything about him anymore.
SUPMALE:When I knew him, he was a professor at a college.
SUPMALE:That's hard to believe.
SUPMALE:It's one of the few places they have professors.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:No, I know that.
LEADMALE:I meant I can't believe he left someone like you.
SUPMALE:He left someone else like me? No.
SUPMALE:I mean you.
SUPFEMALE:That he left you.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:OK.
OTHERMALE:I should be more clear.
LEADMALE:That'd be great.
OTHERMALE:Listen, check with me later about the weekend.
LEADFEMALE:I just want to be sure I'm ready, and that it's right.
LEADMALE:I'll give you a ring.
SUPMALE:I can't accept jewelry.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I'll call you soon.
LEADMALE:I mean, I'll call you, Rose, soon and the phone will ring.
LEADMALE:Oh, he really understands me.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, it's me.
SUPMALE:Mi- Miles? I beg your pardon.
OTHERMALE:I'm sure Blanche will be out any minute.
LEADFEMALE:No, Rose, Rose, it's me.
LEADFEMALE:Miles? I've come back, Rose.
SUPMALE:I had to see you.
SUPFEMALE:But you've changed.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm Amish, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:That's my new identity in the Witness Protection Program.
LEADFEMALE:See, I'm an Amish man.
SUPFEMALE:I live on an Amish farm.
LEADMALE:I carry wood, I dig holes and I milk things.
LEADFEMALE:And to be frank it sucks.
OTHERMALE:I've missed you, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I've missed you, too, Miles.
LEADMALE:No, no, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:My name is now Samuel.
LEADMALE:Samuel Plankmaker.
LEADMALE:Isn't it dangerous for you to be here? You might have been followed.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, I took all kinds of precautions.
LEADMALE:I even switched buggies on the way over.
SUPMALE:Rose, of course, you can't tell a soul who I am.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't worry.
OTHERFEMALE:Your secret is safe with me.
LEADMALE:I don't know what I'm gonna do.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you find out you're a Jew with a dilemma, and these rabbis just come out of the woodwork.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, who is this? This is This is a friend.
SUPFEMALE:His name is Samuel.
LEADMALE:Samuel Plankmaker.
OTHERFEMALE:Samuel, these are my roommates.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, you know Miles.
LEADMALE:Samuel! Shoot! Sorry.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm sorry, ladies.
OTHERMALE:It's me.
OTHERFEMALE:I was hoping to play a trick on you.
LEADFEMALE:Silly Rabbi, tricks are for kids.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, ladies, I know it's a lot to ask, but I just had to see Rose.
SUPMALE:I can't risk leaving, at least not tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I need to stay here, if you'll let me.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Plankmaker.
SUPMALE:I'll fix up a room for you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:I just want to go on record as saying I am against this.
SUPFEMALE:That Cheeseman character could be following Miles, and there's no telling what he would do to me for information.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, you are really so self-centered.
LEADMALE:In the first place, no gangster is going to come here.
LEADFEMALE:And secondly, Blanche, this is important to Rose.
LEADMALE:Aren't you interested in Rose's happiness? Happiness? I'm supposed to be happy? Just when I was getting on with my life, Miles shows up, and for a visit.
SUPMALE:He can't even stay.
LEADMALE:How am I gonna move on? How is my heart ever supposed to heal with Miles here? Do you really think I'm self-centered? Huh? Come on, ya'll, hurry up.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, folks.
OTHERMALE:I've gotta make a quick phone call.
OTHERMALE:Rose, would you mind getting me some punch? He's gonna be late for the initiation ceremony.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, take it easy, Feldman.
SUPMALE:Hello, Billy Club? It's me/n Moran.
LEADMALE:No, Moran The Cheeseman.
LEADMALE:Look, I need some fake ID to get out of the country.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I think my girlfriend's about to blab.
SUPFEMALE: Well, thank you, Evelyn and Margaret, for that gripping and realistic reenactment of the defeat of General Burnside's troops at Fredericksburg.
LEADMALE: It's hard to believe you couldn't get federal funding for this.
LEADFEMALE:Mom says "hi.
LEADFEMALE:" I'm sorry, what? Rose, what's going on with you? You've been acting strange lately.
SUPFEMALE:Seems like you're hiding something from me.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, I can't lie to you.
LEADMALE:It's just not fair.
LEADMALE:I have been hiding something from you.
SUPMALE:I can't tell you where he's been, but Miles is back.
LEADFEMALE:He's staying with me.
OTHERFEMALE:I understand, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:And don't worry about your secret.
LEADFEMALE:It won't go any further than me.
LEADMALE:Now it's time to meet our new applicants and hear their lineage presentations.
LEADMALE:So let us begin with Mrs.
LEADMALE:Louise Blakely.
LEADMALE:Blanche, there is still time to back out.
SUPMALE:Do you really think you can go up there and betray your heritage? Dorothy, I belong in this club.
OTHERMALE:Why, I'm just as Southern as the fruit of a scuppernong arbor growing proudly by the lazy Mississippi.
LEADMALE:Lawdy, Lawdy, are you full of it.
LEADFEMALE:who married my Great Aunt Annalou Sellers, cousin to Claude Livaudais, who begat Elizabeth Blasingame.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Did you say Claude Livaudais? Yes.
SUPMALE:My great-grandfather told stories of Claude Livaudais.
OTHERMALE:He once sold horseshoes to a Union soldier.
OTHERMALE:Yankee.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, I can explain.
LEADFEMALE:Fie.
SUPMALE:Traitor.
LEADFEMALE:Oy vey.
LEADMALE:Well, that was a close one.
OTHERFEMALE:We now call Blanche Devereaux.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, I can't see a thing.
SUPMALE:What's happening now? The Harlem Globetrotters just took the court.
LEADMALE:Hello, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:I want to thank you for making time for me.
LEADFEMALE:But I wonder if, instead of reading my family tree, if I couldn't just say a few words about what the South means to me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:We need your family tree.
SUPMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:OK.
LEADMALE:Well, I am Blanche Devereaux, nee Hollingsworth, of Atlanta, daughter of Curtis Hollingsworth and Samantha Roquet of Augusta and Shreveport, daughter of/n I can't do it.
LEADFEMALE:I Daughter of Feldman.
LEADMALE:I'm a Feldman, damn it.
LEADMALE:Of Buffalo.
SUPFEMALE: Oh, ladies, now, please, I beg of you.
OTHERMALE:Let us put aside our ancient prejudices and change these rules.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, ladies, let my people in.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Next up, we have a lady actually I would like to say something else, if you don't mind.
LEADMALE:Please let me in.
SUPFEMALE:No! Next up/n That wasn't what I was going to say.
SUPMALE:Yes, I am a Yankee, but hath not a Yankee eyes? Hath not a Yankee hands? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? Sometimes all night.
OTHERFEMALE:I've heard her.
LEADMALE:My point is, I am made up of many ingredients, but perhaps that is what gives me my uniquely American flavor.
SUPMALE:Yes, for I am an American, and I'm leavin'.
SUPFEMALE:I don't need your lousy club to make me feel special.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please?  No! Oh, you lost the war.
SUPFEMALE:Get over it.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, I hope you're not too upset about not fitting in with those dreadful people today.
LEADFEMALE:Those small-minded peckerwoods aren't real Southerners.
SUPMALE:I am a real Southerner.
LEADFEMALE:Real Southerners are compassionate people.
SUPMALE:They're wise and gentle, and they sit around on porch swings, regaling with stories of Abraham and Moses and all the other people who worked on the plantation.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I sent Karl home.
LEADFEMALE:Now I just have to talk to Miles.
LEADFEMALE:Talk to Miles? You seeing somebody else, Rose? Ah, I can explain.
LEADFEMALE:No, I understand.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose, of course, you're dating.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why I've come to a decision.
SUPMALE:I'm going to Washington, talk to the Bureau.
SUPFEMALE:I am leaving the Witness Protection Program.
OTHERMALE:I just know I need to be with you.
LEADMALE:But the Cheeseman is looking for you.
LEADMALE:Rose, don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:So, hope I'm not interrupting anything.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God! You! How did you find me? Time to say goodbye, buddy boy.
LEADFEMALE:Karl, Miles, as flattering as this is, I I don't want you fighting over me.
OTHERFEMALE:What? Karl? Is this the man you've been seeing? Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:But don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:He's just a little jealous.
LEADMALE:Got some bad news, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:It's not you he's after.
LEADMALE:He's using you to get to me.
LEADMALE:This is the Cheeseman.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! My/n I'll have to figure out what to do with you.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You can't come into this house waving that gun around.
LEADMALE:Although it is a very nice one.
SUPMALE:What is this, a Colt? Oh, I knew all along it was a bad idea to let Miles stay here.
LEADFEMALE:I'm too young to be struck down by a madman's bullet.
SUPFEMALE:I've gotta find some way out of this.
SUPMALE: I'll get it.
SUPMALE:No one moves and no one makes a sound.
SUPMALE:We all stand still until they leave.
LEADFEMALE:Don't make a move, old lady.
LEADMALE:Nice way to talk to your mother, Pussycat.
OTHERFEMALE:Who is it? Put these on and find out.
LEADFEMALE:My glasses.
LEADFEMALE:Where did you find them? I'm afraid Dreyfuss was the culprit.
LEADFEMALE:He got them off the lanai.
LEADFEMALE:You should really keep that gate closed.
SUPMALE:Anybody could get in here.
SUPFEMALE:It's great.
OTHERMALE:I can finally see again.
OTHERMALE:Hey, it's the Cheeseman.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, get in here, both of ya.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, you recognize Karl as the Cheeseman? You don't? The man's been on America's Most Wanted at least six times.
LEADFEMALE:The last episode was the highest rated ever.
LEADMALE:Ever.
SUPFEMALE:That must be a good feeling.
LEADMALE:Well, it's kind of an acknowledgement.
SUPFEMALE:I hate to interrupt you, but I have some bad news.
SUPMALE:It's all over.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right, you're busted.
LEADFEMALE:Barbara's a cop.
LEADMALE:In a dress, without a gun.
OTHERFEMALE:So, basically, what you have here is a crossing-guard thing.
SUPMALE:All right, all you gals are gonna get locked up in a closet, and us boys are going for a little walk.
SUPFEMALE:Wow.
OTHERFEMALE:Were you ever activities director of a place called Shady Pines? We got a lot of old business to discuss, mi amigo.
LEADMALE:An awful lot.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't there anything you can do, Barbara? I suppose I could do this.
OTHERMALE:All right, Cheeseman, you're under arrest.
SUPMALE:You told us you didn't have a gun.
LEADMALE:You lied.
LEADMALE:To a bad guy.
LEADFEMALE:It's OK to lie to a bad guy.
LEADFEMALE:You see that? There's so many things we, as the public, don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna take this creep out front and read him his rights.
LEADMALE:Somebody call the station and tell 'em to get here, and I need handcuffs, right away.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, OK, you can borrow mine.
SUPMALE:But please be careful with them.
LEADFEMALE:They're a gift.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, why don't we make that phone call from the kitchen? Rose Rose, it's over.
OTHERMALE:I'm a free man.
OTHERMALE:I can be with you now, if that's still what you want.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that's all I've ever wanted.
LEADMALE:But you have to promise me never to leave me again.
LEADMALE:Well, sweetheart, I might have to for a little while.
SUPMALE:Back on my farm in Pennsylvania, I still have an order in for 13 windmills.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, screw 'em.
SUPFEMALE:What are they gonna do, phone? 
SUPFEMALE:
