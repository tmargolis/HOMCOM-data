LEADFEMALE:Give me a break! This is highway robbery.
SUPMALE:I'm on a fixed income.
SUPMALE:OK.
LEADFEMALE:I'm desperate.
OTHERFEMALE:You got a deal.
LEADFEMALE:60.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good news.
SUPMALE:I got your date for the banquet.
LEADMALE:Ma, I'll get my own date.
LEADMALE:Fine, pay 100.
LEADMALE:Here.
OTHERMALE:Help me finish these invitations.
LEADMALE:Hi, girls.
LEADMALE:Boy, am I stuffed! I sampled food from over ten caterers.
LEADMALE:Find one for the banquet?
LEADMALE:Not yet.
SUPMALE:Oh, but I did learn that baked Alaska can actually be cooked locally.
LEADFEMALE:I have an even bigger scoop for you.
SUPMALE:Mars bars are made right here on earth.
SUPMALE:Oh, girls, this time I have really done it.
OTHERMALE:Thanks to me, the hospital charity banquet will be in the Bedford Hotel! Blanche, the Committee is on a budget.
OTHERMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:I worked out a deal.
LEADMALE:We can't afford that room.
LEADMALE:But I worked out a deal.
LEADFEMALE:I told the manager, if we got that room, I'd persuade my sister to sing in his bar.
LEADMALE:You mean your sister Virginia?
OTHERMALE:No, my sister Susan Anton.
LEADMALE:Blanche, how could you tell such a lie? He didn't believe me for a minute.
SUPMALE:Said I was too attractive to be related to her.
LEADMALE:But we got the room, cos he liked my moxie.
LEADFEMALE:And you liked showing him it.
OTHERMALE:Well, we have a place.
OTHERMALE:Now we need a caterer.
LEADMALE:One's dropping by this afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:Did you hire the band?
LEADMALE:Rose is supposed to.
SUPMALE:I warn you, we may end up with the Hansger Flugenhaben Yodeling Quartet.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Not true.
LEADFEMALE:They broke up.
LEADMALE:But the Sonia Van KÃ¼gel Tuba Band is free.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Jake Smollens from VIP Catering.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:I'm Rose Nylund from St Olaf, Minnesota.
SUPMALE:These are my friends, Dorothy and Blanche.
LEADMALE:Blanche Devereaux.
OTHERMALE:I am Chairman of the Planning Committee.
OTHERFEMALE:So, could you tell us something about your background? Well, I've run VIP Catering for five years.
SUPMALE:Before that I was a cook in the Navy.
OTHERFEMALE:I can cook beef for 1,500 or Chateaubriand for two.
LEADMALE:No, Mr Smollens.
LEADMALE:What I meant was, are you married? No, I'm not, and please, call me Jake.
LEADMALE:Oh, my pleasure.
OTHERMALE:I once had an Uncle Jake.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, he could never cook.
SUPFEMALE:He also could never get through our 4th of July picnics without unzipping his overalls.
LEADFEMALE:Too bad your uncle can't make it to the banquet.
LEADMALE:So, er tell me, Jake.
SUPMALE:How much do you think these meals will cost? Well, do you want something simple or fancy? We want something cheap.
LEADFEMALE:I admire your honesty.
LEADFEMALE:I admire your chest.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, er exactly what kind of meal are we talking about? I could do a nice Yankee pot roast.
OTHERFEMALE:Mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables, wild green salad.
OTHERFEMALE:And for starters, my special, clam chowder.
OTHERFEMALE:No charge.
LEADMALE:Mm-mm.
LEADMALE:That sounds delicious.
LEADMALE:Just consider yourself hired.
SUPMALE:Now when shall I come to your place to sample what you have to offer? I got a better idea.
LEADMALE:There's a romantic diner on the Boardwalk.
LEADMALE:They use my recipes.
SUPFEMALE:I'll pick you up tomorrow, and we'll check out a few things.
SUPMALE:I thought you'd never ask!
SUPMALE:Swell.
SUPMALE:I'll see you tomorrow night.
OTHERMALE:OK.
SUPMALE:Nice meeting you, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:Nice meeting you.
SUPMALE:Our pleasure.
LEADMALE:Wow! What a hunk! I know.
OTHERFEMALE:Eat your hearts out! Did it ever occur to you that Rose or I might be interested in Jake? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:And you still used every ploy to nab him?
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Then what do you have to say? Damn, I'm good.
LEADFEMALE:Well, isn't this romantic? Oh, yes, it certainly is if you happen to be Popeye.
LEADFEMALE:Jake, what can I do for you?
OTHERMALE:We'd like the best table.
SUPMALE:OK, buddy.
SUPMALE:Oh, this is great.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:And we'll have the usual.
LEADMALE:Alright.
LEADFEMALE:Is this really the best table?
SUPMALE:Did you get a splinter?
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Then this is the best table.
LEADFEMALE:You're pulling my leg.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to.
LEADMALE:Stop being naughty!
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:I didn't mean that.
SUPMALE:Neither did I.
SUPMALE:Be naughty again! You're one hell of a woman.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:Well, in all my years in the Navy I've never met anybody like you.
SUPMALE:Well, in all my years dating the Navy, I've never met anybody like you.
SUPMALE:Erm Jake, is it my imagination, or is there a tattoo of a nose on your arm? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I got that when I first joined the Navy back in '51.
LEADFEMALE:I was a kid.
LEADFEMALE:I was drunk.
LEADFEMALE:So was the tattooist.
LEADMALE:I asked for a rose, he thought I said "nose".
LEADMALE:Oh, thanks.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Well, Blanche
LEADMALE:I really like being with you.
LEADMALE:I like being with you, too.
SUPFEMALE:Mmm.
OTHERMALE:This looks delicious.
LEADFEMALE:Now, before you eat that clam chowder, there's one thing.
LEADMALE:What? It tastes better if your lips are warmed up.
LEADFEMALE:I see now why it's so romantic here.
SUPMALE:  Thank you.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:And now, for my next number, I'll play something by one of my favorites and, I hope, one of yours.
SUPMALE:Huey Lewis And The News! Er I think we've heard enough, Mr Hinkley.
SUPMALE:OK.
SUPFEMALE:We go right to the big finale.
SUPFEMALE:I'm afraid we're out of time.
OTHERFEMALE:But it's a real show-stopper.
LEADMALE:I hold up two lit sparklers with my hands, and play Hey, Look Me Over with my feet.
LEADMALE:Smoking a cigarette?
SUPFEMALE:No? Darn.
SUPMALE:You were this close.
SUPFEMALE:Goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we're in trouble.
LEADFEMALE:We've auditioned a dozen musicians.
SUPFEMALE:The banquet is two weeks away, and we've no band.
LEADMALE:What do we do? I'll tell you what we're gonna do, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna eat a cheesecake.
SUPMALE:Hi, Ma.
LEADMALE:Shouldn't you be finishing those invitations? I'm here for some water.
LEADFEMALE:Stamp-licking dries me out.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you use a sponge?
LEADMALE:I'd rather drink from a glass.
LEADMALE:Blanche, don't you and Jake have dinner reservations tonight? Yes, we do.
LEADFEMALE:He's late.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, he must have a good reason.
SUPMALE:Anyway, who cares? He is a dreamboat.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, being with Jake has been wonderful, but I cannot get used to some things.
LEADMALE:Really? Like what? Well, it's a question of breeding.
LEADMALE:He uses fingers instead of his knife to eat.
LEADFEMALE:Tucks his napkin into his collar.
LEADMALE:Wears white after Labor Day.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, the man is a winner.
SUPFEMALE:What's the matter with you? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I'm just overly critical.
LEADFEMALE:That sometimes happens when you're stunningly beautiful.
LEADMALE:Not to mention endlessly irritating.
LEADMALE:Blanche, Jake's here.
LEADMALE:Make yourself at home.
LEADFEMALE:Don't touch anything.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, everybody.
LEADMALE:You are filthy! I helped a lady stranded by the roadside, and ended up fixing her transmission.
SUPFEMALE:Aren't there professionals who do that? Andy Granatelli does.
LEADMALE:Although he doesn't actually fix them himself.
OTHERMALE:Doesn't want to dirty his trench coat.
LEADFEMALE:But I hear he has this special school I 
SUPMALE:"Shut up, Rose.
LEADMALE:" Please, honey.
OTHERMALE:I'll make it up to you.
LEADMALE:I'll pack a picnic basket and we'll drive to the beach.
SUPMALE:I'll spread a blanket on the sand, take you in my arms I forgive you.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean I mean Blanche should forgive you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, alright.
LEADMALE:I forgive you.
SUPFEMALE:But forget the picnic.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get us that blanket.
SUPFEMALE:He's a wonderful man.
LEADMALE:Oh, I know.
SUPFEMALE:Why can't I ever attract men like that?
OTHERMALE:You can, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Ma, you really think so? No, but you think I'm gonna tell you that? Ma, did you mail all the invitations? None of the Gs through the Ls has responded.
SUPFEMALE:Sure, I took them in a shoebox to the post office.
SUPMALE:Unless
OTHERMALE:Unless what? Unless I sent my best pair of heels overnight mail.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, this is terrible! You're telling me.
LEADFEMALE:Now I don't have shoes for the party.
LEADMALE:Girls, I am so excited! We have a band.
SUPFEMALE:You hired somebody?
LEADFEMALE:Yep, The Great Pretenders.
LEADFEMALE:It's an all-female jazz band.
LEADFEMALE:They're supposed to be fantastic.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now it's going to be a good party! Oh, it's too bad you couldn't find a better date than Harvey.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I wouldn't brag about my date, if I were you.
OTHERFEMALE:Incidentally, is Walter renting that blue tuxedo again? Walter never rented a blue tuxedo, and you know it.
SUPFEMALE:He owns that blue tuxedo.
LEADMALE:Girls, did Jake call? He is half an hour late.
SUPFEMALE:No, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Will Jake be able to take you to the banquet? Well, he might be able to take me, but my date is Hunter McCoy.
OTHERFEMALE:What about Jake?
LEADFEMALE:What about him? Well, Jake has to take you.
LEADFEMALE:You'll both be there.
LEADMALE:He'll expect you to be there with him.
SUPFEMALE:How could you do this? Well, you make it sound so terrible.
SUPFEMALE:It's not.
LEADMALE:Jake just doesn't belong with certain people.
LEADFEMALE:He's a blue-jeans kind of guy.
LEADMALE:This is a black-tie affair.
LEADFEMALE:We wouldn't have any fun.
SUPMALE:Sometimes you act just like a woman I knew in St Olaf.
LEADFEMALE:Please, no-one say, "What woman?" Blanche, Jake is crazy about you.
SUPFEMALE:You'll break his heart.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, don't be silly.
LEADMALE:Jake knows I care for him, but our relationship can only go so far.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:That's probably him.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:Hello, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Is there somewhere we could be alone?
OTHERFEMALE:Can't it wait till later?
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Alright, I'm flexible.
LEADFEMALE:But of course, you know that already! No, no, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to ask you something now.
SUPFEMALE:Right here, where we first met.
LEADMALE:Erm Ma, Rose, why don't we go into the kitchen?
LEADFEMALE:What, and miss all this?
SUPMALE:Get up! Listen.
LEADMALE:I know what you want to ask me.
LEADMALE:Now, I've been giving our relationship a great deal of thought, and I just think you're a wonderful man.
LEADFEMALE:I love the time we spend together.
LEADMALE:But we do come from two different worlds, you know, so our relationship can only go so far, and I can't go to the banquet with you.
SUPMALE:Well That's not what I was gonna ask you, but you answered my question.
LEADMALE:Why? I don't understand.
LEADFEMALE: I was gonna ask you to marry me.
LEADMALE:Rose, what are you doing up? I can't sleep.
OTHERMALE:I'm having nightmares about the banquet.
LEADFEMALE:Oh? What kind of nightmares? I'm at the banquet.
OTHERMALE:It looks beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:I look beautiful.
OTHERFEMALE:Everybody looks beautiful.
OTHERFEMALE:And suddenly Charlton Heston walks in, dressed like Moses.
OTHERFEMALE:And he tries to part the dessert table.
SUPFEMALE:When that doesn't work, he rounds up the guests and leads them to the lingerie department of the nearest JCPenney's where everybody starts making fun of the fat-lady underwear.
SUPMALE:What do you suppose it means? That you've spent too many years sleeping on curlers.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, you can't sleep, either? No, I'm sleeping so good, I thought I'd come try it in the sink.
SUPMALE:I guess everybody's a little jumpy about the banquet.
SUPFEMALE:Except Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:She could at least have the good taste to pretend she can't sleep.
SUPFEMALE:She's probably nervous about running into Jake.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes, when people are under pressure, they sleep to escape.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy's father used to do that.
OTHERMALE:Unfortunately, it was usually during foreplay.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, the man is dead.
LEADMALE:Longer than you think.
OTHERMALE:I feel bad for Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:She's been moping since she and Jake split.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't expect me to feel sorry.
LEADFEMALE:It's not often that somebody like Jake comes along, and she throws him away.
OTHERMALE:Oh, what's everybody doing up? We were saying how dumb you were to give up Jake.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so upset about it I can't sleep.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, give him a call.
LEADMALE:Oh, I can't.
SUPMALE:He'd try to see me again.
SUPFEMALE:That's out of the question.
LEADMALE:I don't understand.
LEADMALE:What's wrong with Jake? I think he's wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:And you're miserable without him.
SUPMALE:Well, that may be, but in some ways, in some very important ways, we're not compatible.
LEADMALE:You mean he's not good enough?
LEADMALE:No, I don't.
OTHERMALE:Blanche! If we stayed together, our differences would turn us against each other.
OTHERMALE:I care too much to allow that.
LEADFEMALE:You're lucky you have a choice.
SUPMALE:My marriage was arranged.
LEADMALE:You didn't pick Pop?
OTHERFEMALE:He didn't pick me, either.
OTHERMALE:We learned to love each other, but it wasn't our idea.
LEADFEMALE:There were eight unmarried girls and eight unmarried boys in the village.
SUPFEMALE:How did they match them up?
LEADFEMALE:Height.
LEADFEMALE:If I hadn't stood on that rock, I'd have ended up with Luigi the pig-boy.
LEADMALE:If I got another chance at Mr Right, I'd want somebody entirely different from Charlie.
LEADMALE:But I thought you adored him.
LEADMALE:I did.
LEADMALE:I am.
SUPMALE:We had a wonderful life together.
OTHERFEMALE:But I'd like somebody really wild.
OTHERFEMALE:Somebody impulsive, who'd sweep me off my feet.
SUPMALE:He'd come in his convertible Porsche and whisk me to the airport.
SUPMALE:We'd fly to his villa in France, where we'd blindfold the orchestra and dance until dawn.
SUPFEMALE:Then we'd watch the sun come up over two steaming cups of cocoa.
LEADFEMALE:Cocoa? With little marshmallows.
SUPFEMALE:Marshmallows? Rose, you trollop.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, what kind of guy would you like now?  Somebody to get old with.
SUPFEMALE:You can do that by yourself.
SUPFEMALE:I'm aware of that, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Stan didn't want to get old.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'd like someone to sit on the porch with, hold hands, listen to the birds, watch the grass grow.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, what man do you want?
SUPMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:You certainly do your share of comparison shopping.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:What are you looking for? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I just know it's not Jake.
LEADFEMALE:But that won't discourage me from finding Mr Right.
SUPFEMALE:And I won't compromise my standards, either.
LEADMALE:I will look high and low, far and wide, and never lose heart, for I know one day my prince will come.
SUPMALE:What was that supposed to mean? I wasn't paying close attention, but I gathered she's gonna sleep with that little black guy, Prince.
LEADMALE: Rose, Rose, can I speak to you? Oh, sure, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Rose, there is something very odd about that all-female jazz band.
LEADMALE:What?
LEADMALE:They're all men.
LEADFEMALE:I just thought they were really ugly women.
LEADMALE:What do we do?
LEADMALE:Nothing.
LEADMALE:They're great.
SUPFEMALE:If we pretend nothing is wrong, maybe no-one will notice.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, did you get a load of those queens on the bandstand?
LEADFEMALE:Keep your voice down.
OTHERMALE:Why? They know they're queens.
SUPMALE:I think we're a success.
LEADMALE:Congratulations, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Much of the credit goes to the food
LEADMALE:original yet familiar, piquant yet comforting.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche tells me she worked very closely with the caterer.
LEADMALE:Did she mention they were naked? You'll have to excuse my mother.
OTHERFEMALE:She was a witness to the Hindenburg disaster.
OTHERMALE:Jake did a wonderful job.
SUPMALE:Where is he? Oh, probably out in the kitchen.
SUPFEMALE:There he is, by the dessert table.
SUPMALE:Oh, he looks great in his tux! Hunter, would you be a dear and er get me another wine spritzer? Will you do me a favor? Keep Hunter occupied while I go after Jake.
LEADFEMALE:What? You said you never wanted to see him again.
OTHERFEMALE:I made a mistake.
LEADMALE:A terrible, terrible mistake.
SUPFEMALE:What could I have been thinking? How could I let him go? What difference does it make how he dresses or eats? What matters is, he's the man I love.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Erm Where's Blanche going? Erm she went to powder her nose.
LEADFEMALE:At the dessert table? Er well, the powder sticks better if you put a thin layer of caramel first.
LEADFEMALE:Hunter, you look skeptical.
LEADFEMALE:Well, hello.
LEADMALE:I didn't see you standing there.
SUPFEMALE:Really? I haven't been able to take my eyes off you.
LEADMALE:You look great.
LEADMALE:Jake, the reason I came over I wanted to tell you I made a mistake.
LEADMALE:Our differences don't really matter.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I admire you.
LEADFEMALE:You're a very special woman.
LEADMALE:But you didn't make a mistake.
SUPMALE:You were right.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I'm happy.
LEADFEMALE:I like myself.
LEADFEMALE:I want to share my life with somebody who's as comfortable with me as I am with them.
LEADMALE:I don't want to wonder if I'm using the wrong fork.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:You said our differences don't matter.
OTHERMALE:But they did before, and they will again.
LEADMALE:Blanche, knowing you has been one of the best things that's happened to me in my whole life.
SUPFEMALE:Remember that.
LEADMALE:Jake
SUPFEMALE:Let me kiss you.
LEADMALE:Goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, what happened? Well, Jake said he thinks we have too many differences, so we're not getting back together.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, I'm so sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I don't understand how I let this thing happen.
LEADMALE:I'm so confused.
OTHERMALE: Honey, you think you're confused? Take a look at our horn section.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, aren't you even going to try to sleep?  I'm too upset.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, let's face it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not 16 anymore.
LEADFEMALE:There's no line of beaux on the front porch waiting to walk me to town.
SUPMALE:No more cotillions, no more sorority parties.
LEADFEMALE:I just lost the best thing that's happened to me since I met George.
SUPMALE:I'm just a stupid old fool, sitting up all night with a broken heart.
SUPMALE:Blanche Devereaux, I cannot believe what I am hearing.
OTHERMALE:You are the prettiest, most vibrant, most exciting woman I know.
OTHERFEMALE:Men still line up for you.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Your dance card is going to be full for the rest of your life.
SUPMALE:I don't know whether you meant that or not, Dorothy, but thank you.
LEADMALE: Damn, I'm good.
LEADMALE:
