LEADFEMALE: Hi, Ma.
LEADMALE:Give me your watch.
SUPMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:What do you want it for? I'm working on a magic act for the talent show at the center.
OTHERMALE:Abracadabra, one, two, three.
SUPMALE:Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Relax.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, was your card the ace of spades? Ma, what the hell are you talking about? I think I got chapter seven and nine mixed up.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:This watch is broken.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, Stan gave me that watch when we got married! The marriage never worked, why should the watch?  I've got bigger problems.
SUPMALE:I don't have an act for the talent show.
LEADMALE:Talent show? Can I be in it? Blanche, what you're talented at isn't generally done on a stage.
LEADMALE:This isn't downtown Saigon.
SUPMALE:Ma, will you do me a favor and forget about the talent show? You're just gonna end up with egg on your face like last year.
LEADFEMALE:What did you do last year, Sophia? What are you, deaf? She just told you.
LEADFEMALE:I tried to juggle eggs.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:What's the matter, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Is something wrong? I'm concerned about nuclear war.
OTHERFEMALE:And just yesterday, her biggest concern was whether Bubbles the chimp was traveling with Michael Jackson against his will.
LEADMALE:Okay, honey, tell us what's wrong.
SUPFEMALE:What does this picture look like to you? Uh, me sitting on a throne dressed as Cleopatra, watching while two naked men wrestle to see who gets to make love to me.
OTHERMALE:It's the end of the world.
SUPFEMALE:Only for the loser.
SUPMALE:Okay, Rose, what is this all about? You know that Sunshine Cadet troop I've been helping out with? This was done by one of the girls.
LEADFEMALE:She calls it "Nuclear Bomb, The Day After.
SUPMALE:" Eight years old and this is on her mind.
OTHERMALE:That's unbelievable.
SUPFEMALE:She wasn't the only one.
SUPFEMALE:Three other girls did pictures just like it.
LEADFEMALE:I don't understand it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, it's not so uncommon.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, kids hear about nuclear war on TV.
LEADMALE:They read it in the papers.
LEADFEMALE:It's part of their lives.
LEADMALE:They can't help but think about it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's so sad.
SUPFEMALE:When I was eight years old I was just worried about the usual childhood things.
LEADFEMALE:How much would the tooth fairy leave me? What would I get from Santa? Would I ever be chosen small curd cottage cheese queen.
LEADMALE:I'm only doing this because I have some more coffee left to drink.
LEADFEMALE:Small curd cottage cheese queen? It's our town's biggest honor, right after  Large curd cottage cheese queen.
LEADFEMALE:The point I'm trying to make is kids should enjoy being kids.
SUPMALE:They should be looking forward to their future, not worrying about the end of the world.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, what's with the long faces? We were just talking about the bomb.
OTHERFEMALE:Very nice.
OTHERMALE:You haven't even seen my new act.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, we were not talking about you.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody's gonna be talking about me when they see what I cooked up for the talent show.
LEADMALE:I call my new act "Sophia and Sophia.
OTHERFEMALE:" Get a load of this.
LEADMALE:Uh, hi, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Oh, hello, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:How are you feeling today? I've got a little arthritis in my neck.
SUPFEMALE:I was wondering why my wrist was hurting.
LEADMALE:What do you think? Come on, Ma, you could see your lips moving.
LEADFEMALE:So? Well, a ventriloquist's lips aren't supposed to move, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Is that common knowledge? I'm afraid so, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Otherwise it would just be you talking with a sock on your hand.
OTHERMALE:Tough break, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:One minute you're about to entertain the masses, the next you're back on a foot covering a corn pad.
SUPMALE:Now you know how Valerie Harper feels.
LEADMALE:Well, it's my turn to cook dinner.
LEADMALE:What does everybody want? Nothing for me, thanks.
SUPMALE:I'm not hungry.
SUPFEMALE:Don't let this get to you.
SUPMALE:It's something you can't do anything about.
LEADFEMALE:I've always believed you can fix a problem, no matter how big it is, if you just put your mind to it.
LEADFEMALE:How are you gonna fix nuclear war, write a letter to President Reagan? That would be pretty stupid, wouldn't it, Blanche? Reagan's only responsible for half the problem.
LEADMALE:I'll have to write to Gorbachev, too.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, honey, you can't be serious.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, I'm taking my troop on a camp out in two weeks.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want this nuclear nonsense spoiling our fun.
SUPMALE:A well written, thoughtful, intelligent letter to Reagan and Gorbachev might just do the trick.
LEADFEMALE:Anybody know how many Z's there are in "czar"? Oh I don't know why I bothered to make this.
LEADFEMALE:Rose could've sat on my hand.
SUPMALE:To this day the ghost of the headless Indian roams the forest crying out, "Where is my head? Where is my head?" If the Indian doesn't have a head, how can he cry out? Maybe he talks out of his behind like Cadet Master Rose.
LEADMALE:Well, the Indian cries out from his heart.
SUPFEMALE:That's the worst kind of cry.
SUPFEMALE:My father's a surgeon.
LEADMALE:That's physiologically impossible.
SUPFEMALE:How can we be drawn into the story if you're misrepresenting the facts.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, it's a make-believe, scary camp out story.
OTHERMALE:Ooh, real scary.
OTHERMALE:You want scared, kid? You keep it up.
SUPFEMALE:My mother's a lawyer.
SUPFEMALE:Threaten me again and I'll own your house.
OTHERFEMALE:Your father's a doctor, your mother's a lawyer.
LEADMALE:What are you, one of the Cosby kids?
LEADFEMALE:This is boring.
LEADMALE:I want to watch MTV.
LEADFEMALE: Yeah! You can't watch television, we're on a camp out.
LEADFEMALE:No we're not.
LEADMALE:We're in your living room.
LEADFEMALE:The camp out was called off, remember? The rain doesn't have to spoil our fun.
OTHERFEMALE:There's nothing we can do outside that we can't do right here.
LEADMALE:You promised us we could pee in the woods.
SUPFEMALE:Get away from that couch.
OTHERFEMALE:I have an idea.
LEADFEMALE:Who's in the mood for some real camp out food? I have beans, I have beef jerky, marshmallows We want pizza.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, with artichoke hearts and shitake mushrooms.
LEADMALE: Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, would you be terribly disappointed if I took the troop down the block for some pizza?  No! All right, in an orderly fashion head for the station wagon.
OTHERFEMALE:That's not the way to get your good behavior badges.
OTHERMALE:Come on, now, you all know you use both fingers for the sunshine salute! I'm so glad those little heathens finally left.
SUPFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:I am exhausted.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think I'd have the energy to raise more children.
LEADMALE:Although I am still in my childbearing years.
LEADMALE:Sure, Blanche, you and Emma Jean Cocoa.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, my God, they're back.
SUPMALE: Now I know how the family in Poltergeist felt.
LEADFEMALE:Does Rose Nylund live here? I'm sorry, you missed her.
OTHERFEMALE:She left with her cadet troop.
SUPMALE: Can we help you? I am Alexi Bovanov from the Russian embassy.
SUPMALE:Premier Gorbachev read Rose's letter and would like to meet with her.
LEADMALE:I'm so sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so sorry It's Coca Cola, no? No need to apologize.
LEADFEMALE:In Moscow I stand in line six hours for half as much.
SUPFEMALE:Would you please make sure Rose receives this note? Wait, you can't be serious.
OTHERFEMALE:Why would the premier of Russia want to see Rose? He was quite moved by her letter.
SUPFEMALE:He wishes to extend an invitation to her and her family to visit Moscow and discuss nuclear disarmament and world peace.
LEADMALE:We'll be in touch.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this has to be some kind of joke.
SUPMALE:No, it isn't.
SUPMALE:Look at this.
LEADFEMALE:This is an official document to Rose from the premier of Russia.
LEADMALE:But why would he want to meet the same woman who once said, "If the city of Atlantis is lost, how can Bobby Vinton appear there twice a year?" Rose, the most unbelievable thing has happened.
OTHERFEMALE:Remember that letter you wrote to Gorbachev?
LEADFEMALE:He's answered it.
LEADFEMALE:He wants to see you!
SUPFEMALE:What did Reagan say? Well, nothing.
SUPFEMALE:He didn't send a letter.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that is unbelievable.
LEADFEMALE:I wrote him two days earlier.
SUPMALE:I did the dumbest thing.
SUPMALE:I walked out of this house and completely forgot it's a full moon.
SUPFEMALE:Under those conditions a Sunshine Cadet Master must wear full headdress.
LEADFEMALE:Here I come, girls!  Kemosabe, I think the world is in heap big trouble.
OTHERMALE:   We interrupt this dream for a special news report.
LEADFEMALE:Good evening, I'm Edwin Newman.
LEADFEMALE:The eyes of the entire world were on Moscow today as Rose Nylund continued her mission of peace.
LEADFEMALE:It was 15 days ago that Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Nylund wrote the now historic letter that captured the attention of Premier Gorbachev.
SUPMALE:Today she was in Red Square capturing the hearts and minds of the Russian people.
LEADFEMALE:We switch now to Moscow.
LEADMALE:  Rose.
OTHERMALE:Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Rose.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to know Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Zhivago is my favorite movie of all time.
SUPMALE: Now I'd like to introduce my friends.
LEADFEMALE: No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:This is Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:You have a very beautiful country and I have enjoyed my stay here.
SUPFEMALE:When it comes down to it, your lives aren't really that different than ours.
SUPFEMALE:Except for your toilet paper.
LEADMALE:No wonder you people always look so grouchy.
LEADFEMALE: And this is my friend Blanche.
LEADMALE:Hello, you all.
LEADMALE:I have had such a great time here that I would like to express my appreciation to Premier Gorbachev on this special day.
SUPMALE: Happy birthday to you  Happy birthday to you  Happy birthday Mr.
LEADMALE:Number One Communist  Happy birthday to you   Ma, what are you doing here? Thanks a lot for leaving me home.
LEADMALE:Lucky I found this nice German kid who flew me to Red Square.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
LEADMALE:I know you're dying to hear my act, so I'll get right to it.
LEADFEMALE:I just flew in from Miami and boy, I've got to tell you, your Moscow was one clean town.
OTHERFEMALE:No litter on the streets and all the bugs are in the American Embassy.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:And thank you all.
OTHERFEMALE:Remember, give peace a chance.
LEADFEMALE:The Moscow audience is the best audience in the world.
LEADMALE: The best audience in the world.
LEADMALE:The best audience in the world.
LEADFEMALE:The best audience in the world.
SUPMALE:The best audience in the
OTHERFEMALE:Rose.
SUPMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Are you all right, honey? Oh, I'm fine.
LEADMALE:I just had a dream.
OTHERFEMALE:We were all in Moscow.
LEADFEMALE:It was snowing and we were all wearing fake furs.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I'm just nervous about that press conference tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:I've never had a press conference before.
LEADFEMALE:The idea of all those reporters coming to the house to ask me questions scares me to death.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, relax.
LEADMALE:Reporters are just people.
LEADMALE:They put on their pants one leg at a time.
OTHERFEMALE:Except for that sports writer Steve Maxwell.
SUPFEMALE:He likes to jump into both legs all at once, with a little hop step.
OTHERMALE:Rose, honey, there is nothing to be nervous about.
SUPMALE:Honey, the press wants to meet you because Gorbachev really respects your views on world peace.
SUPMALE:Boy, when you say it out loud it really sort of lays there.
LEADMALE:Pay attention.
OTHERMALE:You're in for a treat.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Ma, not another act.
LEADMALE:No, Dorothy, not just another act, the act.
LEADMALE:I've taken a classic and reworked it Sophia-style.
LEADMALE:  Thanks for the Medicare  For Blue Cross and Blue Shield  For a hip that finally healed  Remember on prescriptions Generic is a steal  We thank you so much  What do you think? Don't hold back.
OTHERFEMALE:I can take the criticism.
OTHERFEMALE:Depressing.
SUPFEMALE:Awful.
LEADFEMALE:Stinky.
LEADMALE:Go to hell, all of you! Actually, she took it better than I had expected.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, I've been talking to that good-looking reporter.
LEADMALE:He just got back from Russia.
LEADFEMALE:He told me some very interesting things.
LEADMALE: It snows there in the summertime and they don't have very many attractive women.
OTHERMALE:Do you realize what that means? When we go to Russia, I will have my pick of any man in the country and you can make a snowman in June.
OTHERMALE:We can start the press conference now.
OTHERFEMALE:Where is Rose? She left to pick up her cadet troop.
LEADMALE:That's adorable.
LEADFEMALE:She wants to share this moment with friends her own age.
LEADMALE:You must very proud of your daughter.
LEADFEMALE:My daughter?
OTHERMALE:Friends her own age? Why, how old do you think Rose is? Well, based upon her letter, we figure nine or ten.
SUPMALE: To be perfectly honest, she's closer to ten.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, could I see you in the kitchen for a moment? Was there anything we could get you? Coffee, tea, pair of Levi's? Well that solves the mystery.
OTHERMALE:They think Rose is a little kid.
LEADMALE:What are we going to do? If she reads that letter to the press she'll humiliate herself.
OTHERMALE:We can't tell those Russians the truth.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? Because they will use it as a propaganda ploy to convince the whole world that all Americans are as dumb as Rose.
LEADMALE:That would rock the very foundation of our government, undermine our great leaders and potentially topple our entire democracy.
LEADMALE:Rocky IV had a profound effect on you, didn't it? Oh, come on, we have to tell them the truth.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, girls.
SUPFEMALE:I hope I'm not late.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Rose, listen, we have something to tell you.
SUPFEMALE:This is amazing, this is so amazing.
SUPFEMALE:To think I'm giving a press conference and next week we all go to Moscow.
LEADFEMALE:Can you believe it, Dorothy? No, but then again, I can't believe that God wanted Jerry Falwell to go down that water slide in a cheap suit.
LEADFEMALE:Rose I'm babbling, but it's because I'm so excited.
OTHERMALE:Maybe I should open up with a joke.
LEADMALE:No, my jokes are boring.
SUPMALE:Maybe I should just tell a story.
SUPFEMALE:Like the time my Uncle Gustav got drunk and tried to milk a porcupine.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, we have to tell you something.
LEADFEMALE:There has been a misunderstanding.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, we just found out today that everybody thinks the letter you sent to Gorbachev was written by a nine-year-old girl.
LEADMALE:You can't be serious.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, the troop is back.
LEADMALE:Which one is little Rose? This one! This is little Rose right here.
OTHERMALE:I will inform the press we are about to begin.
LEADFEMALE:This is so embarrassing.
SUPFEMALE: Don't worry.
LEADMALE:We'll let Linda read your letter.
OTHERFEMALE:No one will be wiser.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Is it all right, Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Nylund? Gee, I don't know.
SUPMALE:I guess so.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:I was afraid I wouldn't get my moon beam badge because you said a Sunshine Cadet never lies.
OTHERFEMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, several weeks ago I brought a letter to the attention of our premier.
SUPMALE:He was so moved by it's child-like simplicity, he requested to meet with the little girl who wrote it.
LEADMALE:I would like to introduce you to that extraordinary nine-year-old girl, Rose Nylund.
LEADFEMALE:Uh
LEADMALE:I'm Rose Nylund.
LEADMALE:Oh, boy.
LEADFEMALE: I'm the one who wrote the letter.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, boy.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess there's been some kind of misunderstanding, but a Sunshine Cadet never lies.
LEADFEMALE: I have two announcements.
SUPFEMALE:This press conference is canceled, and I am proud to be the newest citizen of Miami.
LEADMALE:If anyone wants to reach me, my name is Dave.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, that took a lot of courage.
SUPMALE:You all right?
LEADMALE:No! This is the worst day of my life.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on, honey.
LEADFEMALE:It's not that bad.
SUPMALE:I made a total fool of myself in front of the press.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the laughingstock of the entire country.
LEADFEMALE:What am I going to tell my mother? Your mother's from St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf.
LEADMALE:She'll understand.
SUPMALE:I'm just stupid.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a dimwitted, dumb, simpleminded, grade-A, Minnesota chucklehead.
SUPFEMALE:But, the important thing is you're our chucklehead, and we wouldn't trade you in for any other chucklehead in the whole wide world.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you take it, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE: Listen to me.
LEADMALE:What you did was great.
SUPFEMALE:It was historic.
LEADMALE:Honey, your words managed to move the heart of a major world leader.
OTHERMALE:I would like to hear those words, too.
LEADMALE:You promised us you would read us that letter.
LEADMALE:I never will.
LEADFEMALE:It's too embarrassing.
SUPFEMALE:You said today was the worst day of your life.
LEADMALE:What have you got to lose? I'll never read this letter.
SUPFEMALE:Never.
LEADMALE:All right, then will you let me read it? Oh, fine, kick me while I'm down.
OTHERFEMALE:I might as well get used to it.
LEADFEMALE:"Dear Mr.
OTHERMALE:Gorbachev.
LEADFEMALE:My name is Rose Nylund.
SUPMALE:I'm writing to you because I'm worried about nuclear war.
OTHERFEMALE:I hear there are enough bombs to blow up the world 100 times and it scares me.
SUPMALE:It scares the girls in my cadet troop, too.
LEADMALE:They talk about what they want to be if they grow up, not when they grow up.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I'm asking you to please unplug your bombs.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet my bottom dollar, or in your case, your bottom ruble, that if you called President Reagan, he'd do the same thing.
LEADMALE:It's just someone has to be first.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Your friend, Rose Nylund.
OTHERFEMALE:P.
SUPMALE:S.
SUPMALE: Don't call the president in the afternoon.
LEADMALE:That's when he takes naps.
LEADMALE:" Honey, that was really beautiful.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a shame that more people don't think like nine year olds.
LEADMALE: Oh.
OTHERMALE: Hello? Yes, she is.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, for you.
SUPMALE:Hello? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:It's the president! Yes, Mr.
SUPMALE:President.
LEADFEMALE: Thank you.
SUPMALE:Goodbye.
LEADMALE:The president loved my letter! I've got to write this down in my diary right now.
LEADMALE:I just figured out what I'm gonna do for the talent contest.
LEADMALE:What, Sophia?
LEADMALE:What? My Reagan impression.
OTHERMALE:
