LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:It's your cab, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Have a wonderful time at the wedding.
SUPMALE:Be sure to give Phil and the family my love.
SUPFEMALE:Before I go, I need your opinion on something.
OTHERFEMALE:What should I give Phil's daughter as a wedding gift? Your grandmother's lace tablecloth, or 50 bucks towards getting a neck? Give her the tablecloth.
OTHERFEMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:She's got a husband.
OTHERFEMALE:He doesn't care that she looks like Abe Vigoda, why should I? See you in a couple of weeks, pussycat.
OTHERMALE: So, what with our busy careers and full social lives, we felt we really needed a full-time housekeeper.
SUPFEMALE:What do you think of our home?
LEADMALE:Lovely.
LEADMALE:Last place I was had bars in the windows and a big wall with guard dogs.
SUPMALE:Sounds like quite a security system.
SUPFEMALE:The best.
SUPMALE:San Quentin.
LEADMALE:Fifteen years I spent in that stinking hole.
LEADFEMALE:I saw violence, I saw despair, I saw Johnny Cash eight times.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess that concludes the interview,
LEADMALE:unless there are any questions.
LEADMALE:I have a question.
SUPFEMALE:Does Johnny Cash ever wear plaid? It's not her fault.
SUPFEMALE:She's from Minnesota.
LEADFEMALE:We'll be in touch.
SUPMALE:Oh, girls, we have interviewed dozens of people, we haven't met one likely candidate.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe our standards are too high.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:May I help you?
LEADFEMALE: Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Does the mean-looking white woman I just passed live here?
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Then I come to apply for the housekeeping position.
LEADFEMALE:Please, please, come right in.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:I'm Marguerite Brown.
SUPMALE:I'm Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:These are my roommates, Blanche, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADMALE:Well, why don't you begin by telling us a little about yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there isn't much to tell.
LEADFEMALE:I'm hardworking and honest, and I'll work for a reasonable wage.
SUPFEMALE:That's it? All right, I won't go on with this charade any longer.
LEADMALE:There is something else.
SUPMALE:I'm black.
SUPMALE:Now, if that's a problem for you, I'm white.
LEADMALE:Now, of course, that'll cost you extra.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Marguerite, I could kiss you.
SUPFEMALE:And I don't go for that freaky stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Neither do Dorothy and I.
LEADFEMALE: Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Hello? Hello, Norman, darling.
OTHERFEMALE:Are we still on for tonight? But you said we But you promised I see.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Bye-Bye.
SUPMALE:I don't understand.
LEADMALE:That's the second time Norman has canceled.
LEADMALE:Maybe he's not interested.
LEADFEMALE:Not interested? Don't be silly.
SUPFEMALE:I am the most attractive and available woman in all of Miami, now that Miss Donna Rice has moved to Hollywood.
LEADFEMALE:I don't mean to pry, but maybe I know a way to get Norman's attention.
OTHERFEMALE:If it involves silk sheets and a parochial school outfit, I've already tried it.
OTHERFEMALE:Here, take this.
OTHERFEMALE:It's worked for my grandmother, it's worked for my mother.
LEADMALE:Dab a little behind your ears and whomever you desire will come to you.
LEADFEMALE:What is it?
LEADMALE:It's a gift.
SUPFEMALE:Keep it.
LEADFEMALE:Marguerite, there's no need to bribe me.
SUPMALE:As far as I'm concerned you have the job.
LEADMALE:Fine with me.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
SUPMALE:Can you start tomorrow?
LEADFEMALE:I'll be here bright early.
LEADMALE:We'll see you then.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Be sure and use that just like I told you now.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, ma'am.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE: Bye.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, what an absolutely charming woman.
SUPMALE:I wonder what this is.
LEADMALE:I'll bet it's a love potion.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, Rose, come on, honey.
OTHERMALE:There's no such thing as a love potion.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure there is, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:My grandparents got together because of a love potion.
LEADFEMALE:Well, actually it was a foot salve Gramps accidentally swallowed.
LEADMALE:You see, Grandma was the nurse who pumped his stomach, but she was new and she attached the nozzle to the wrong place.
LEADFEMALE:Next thing you know, they were engaged.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't care what's in this.
SUPFEMALE:It's worth a try.
LEADMALE:I'll do anything to get Norman's attention.
LEADMALE:If you get Norman's attention, it won't be because of what is in that bottle.
LEADFEMALE:But if it does, I'll sell my mother for an ounce.
LEADFEMALE:Girls.
SUPMALE:Girls, look what I found under my bed.
OTHERMALE:Gee, that's the most colorful dust ball I've ever seen.
OTHERFEMALE:This is no dust ball, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:What do you think it is? It's a rock.
LEADFEMALE:I think it may be some kind of charm.
OTHERMALE:It is.
OTHERMALE:I learned it from my grandmother.
LEADFEMALE:You see, you put a specially-painted rock beneath a person's bed to bring them a restful sleep.
LEADMALE:Are you saying that you put this under my bed? But I was only trying to be helpful.
SUPFEMALE:I figured with those terrible bags, you needed the rest.
LEADMALE:Dorothy always looks like that.
OTHERMALE:Besides, it would take a lot more than rest to get rid of those babies.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you all take turns hitting me with a two-by-four? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cause any trouble.
LEADFEMALE:I think Marguerite's been inhaling a little too much Pine-Sol.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Weren't you just saying this morning how much better you're sleeping lately? That's right, you said you hadn't slept so well in years.
SUPMALE:It has nothing to do with this rock.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I like Marguerite as much as you do, but she's been here a week and she is not doing a very good job.
LEADFEMALE:I think she's doing a terrific job.
SUPMALE:Why, ever since she gave me that potion, Norman's been on me like white on rice.
LEADMALE:I'm talking about White on rice? All right, maybe she's lax on the housework.
LEADFEMALE:She is more than a little lax.
SUPFEMALE:She's habitually late, she's broken a number of glasses and she threw out People Magazine before I could read it.
LEADFEMALE:Look at all the wonderful things that have happened since Marguerite started working here.
OTHERMALE:Blanche is dating Norman, you're sleeping better than you have in years and Sandy Duncan is finally back on TV.
SUPFEMALE:I think we should have a little talk with her.
SUPFEMALE:You know Sandy Duncan? Look, Marguerite didn't throw out People.
LEADMALE: Oh, good.
LEADMALE:Morning, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:Why are you cleaning the kitchen? This is Marguerite's job.
LEADFEMALE:I know exactly what you're going to say, but I talked to Marguerite on the phone and she has a good excuse for being late.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine, what is it?  She had to go pluck a hair from the chin of a dwarf.
LEADFEMALE:And you fell for that old excuse.
LEADFEMALE:Has either of you girls seen Marguerite?
LEADMALE:She's not here yet.
SUPMALE:I wished you'd look at this.
LEADMALE:She melted my buttons with the iron.
LEADMALE:Now I'll never be able to open my blouse again.
LEADFEMALE:It's a dark day in the history of mankind.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we'd better have another talk with Marguerite.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I think we've had enough talks.
LEADMALE:It's time we did something about this.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dorothy, you don't think we ought to fire her.
LEADMALE:Look, Marguerite is a lovely person.
LEADMALE:She just cannot do the job.
LEADFEMALE: I hate to admit it, but you're right.
LEADFEMALE:We had a similar situation back in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf, with Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Gunderson, our grade school teacher.
OTHERMALE:Oh, she was the nicest woman you'd ever want to meet, but as the years went by, she got her facts a little confused.
LEADFEMALE: In biology class she started telling kids While we were studying WWI, she told us mustard gas was something you got from eating too many hot dogs.
LEADMALE:That's why to this day in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf, everyone celebrates the 4th of July with a thin omelet on a bun.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you say after we fire Marguerite, we each chip in and get Rose a CAT scan.
SUPMALE:Rose, is there a point to your story? Well, of course there's a point to it.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Gunderson was a really sweet woman but she just couldn't do the job anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Then it's settled.
LEADMALE:We fire Marguerite.
SUPFEMALE:Couldn't we wait just a few more days? I think Norman's going to invite me to the premiere of Give 'em Hell, Harry! Starring Mr.
OTHERMALE:Father Mulcahy from MASH.
OTHERFEMALE:What does that have to do with Marguerite? It was her potion that brought us together.
LEADMALE:Blanche, you still think that Marguerite has some kind of mystical powers?  Oh, well, all right.
LEADMALE:I guess I'm just being silly.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, go ahead and fire her, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Why should I be the one to fire her? You're the meanest.
LEADMALE:Blanche, that's not true.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy just looks the meanest.
OTHERFEMALE:We hired Marguerite together, we fire her together.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Rose.
LEADMALE:And by the way, you look the dumbest.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, everyone.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Marguerite, I feel so terrible.
LEADMALE:What's the matter with her?
LEADFEMALE:She's a little upset.
LEADMALE:She just found out Gene Shalit wants his hair to look that way.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry I'm late, but I had to go downtown to get some special herbs.
SUPMALE:I'm throwing together another little aphrodisiac for Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I better get to my work.
LEADMALE:Girls, we can't fire her now, she's making me an aphrodisiac! Use vodka and black underwear like everyone else! Can we just get this over before I lose my nerve? Oh! I hate to interrupt your work, but we have to talk to you.
SUPMALE: I just want you to know that Tootie is my favorite on The Facts of Life.
SUPMALE:You're firing me, aren't you? Marguerite, we think very highly of you as a person, but we're going to have to let you go.
SUPMALE:We we just don't feel you're right for this job.
LEADFEMALE:But you certainly did when you hired me.
SUPMALE:Marguerite, you're fired! Rose, we just did that part, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:I'm not very good at this sort of thing.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, we'll pay you for the rest of the week.
LEADMALE:Oh, Marguerite, I hope you understand.
LEADMALE:I've never been fired from any job.
LEADMALE:We're really awfully sorry.
SUPMALE:Well, you should be, because I think you're making a very big mistake.
LEADFEMALE:She seemed pretty upset.
LEADMALE:We just fired her.
OTHERMALE:What do you think she meant, "we're making a big mistake?" She meant that she's unhappy that she lost her job.
LEADFEMALE: Or that she's going to blow up our kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Oh!  Nice hit, Tracy.
LEADMALE:Now, why don't you throw one into the Schiller's yard? This has been the worst day of my life.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, what happened to you? First, my alarm didn't go off so I was late to work.
LEADMALE:Then I had a flat tire on the way.
OTHERFEMALE:When I finally got there, I smashed my hand in the door.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I feel like crawling under the covers and eating Velveeta right out of the box.
LEADFEMALE:I hear B.
LEADFEMALE:B.
LEADMALE:King does that when he's tired of singing the blues.
LEADMALE:Honey, why don't you sit down.
LEADMALE:I'll give you some lemonade.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE: Something weird is going on around here, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be silly.
LEADFEMALE:You're just having a little bad luck.
LEADMALE:Do you really think that's all it is? Of course.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Need any help?
LEADMALE:Get away from me, you jinx.
LEADMALE:I mean I mean, no thank you, Rose.
LEADMALE:Girls, you'll never guess what happened.
OTHERFEMALE:Norman threw me over for a fat woman.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Rose, but Dorothy ought to be sorry, it's all her fault.
LEADMALE:What? What did I do?
SUPMALE:You made us fire Marguerite.
LEADFEMALE:Now she's put a curse on us.
LEADFEMALE:Come on now.
OTHERFEMALE:You're just upset.
LEADMALE:You're talking nonsense.
LEADFEMALE:It makes perfect sense to me.
LEADFEMALE:I rest my case.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, you have to admit terrible things have been happening since we fired Marguerite.
SUPMALE:Our plumbing went bad, the refrigerator broke down.
OTHERFEMALE:We've all had car trouble.
LEADFEMALE:You haven't slept a wink, and now Blanche's boyfriend's dumped her for a porker.
LEADFEMALE:Marguerite said we were making a big mistake when we fired her
LEADMALE:and she was right.
LEADFEMALE:I am not listening to this.
LEADFEMALE:You better listen, 'cause we're in big trouble here.
LEADFEMALE:Now, what are we gonna do? I think we should get Marguerite to take off the curse.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we should ask her if she wants her job back.
SUPMALE:That's a great idea.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna call her now.
SUPMALE:Wait, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody is calling anybody.
LEADFEMALE:Now, look, this whole thing has gotten way out of hand.
SUPFEMALE:First of all there is no such thing as a curse.
OTHERFEMALE:No! All right, we've had a little bad luck, but, ladies, that's life.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, when you look at it, has anything that out of the ordinary really happened? This isn't the Orange Bowl, is it? Gee, I hope Marguerite likes champagne.
SUPMALE:Don't you think we may be going a little overboard with this? Dorothy, remember the crow man.
SUPMALE:Do we have any caviar to go with this champagne?  Oh, that must be Oh, girls, I'm scared.
LEADMALE:Now, now, just take a deep breath and relax.
LEADFEMALE:There's nothing to be scared of.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Okay, Dorothy, get the door.
LEADMALE:Go on.
LEADMALE:Oh, Marguerite, how lovely to see you again.
SUPFEMALE:Please come in.
LEADMALE:Hello, ladies.
SUPFEMALE:Welcome back, Marguerite.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you sit down and make yourself comfortable.
LEADFEMALE:I must say I was a little bit surprised when you called me to give me back my job.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I wanted to explain There's nothing to explain.
LEADMALE:It was all a silly mistake.
SUPMALE:Champagne.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, thank you.
LEADMALE:Ladies
LEADFEMALE:These are for you.
LEADFEMALE:Ladies, this is all very nice, but, please, there's something I must say.
SUPFEMALE:You see, when you fired me Oh, now, we don't have to go into that.
LEADFEMALE:Here, a little gift from us to you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, uh  Well Well, isn't that nice? A tiara? Well, you said to get something I'd buy for myself.
LEADFEMALE:You see, I've always wanted a tiara.
SUPFEMALE:Ever since I was a little girl back in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf.
SUPMALE:Every year I'd blow out my birthday candles and wish for one.
LEADMALE:And every year I'd get a freshly-carved pair of wooden shoes.
SUPMALE:Except for one year, during the Depression when I just got a block of coal, which I carved into a pair of high-top Keds.
LEADMALE:You can do anything you want to her, just don't hurt us.
LEADFEMALE:Here, Marguerite.
LEADFEMALE:Let me put this on for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my! You look stunning.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't she just look stunning? Sophia! What are you doing here? I live here, remember? What is this, the Miss Black America contest? Marguerite, I'd like you to meet my mother.
SUPMALE:This is my mother, Sophia Petrillo.
LEADMALE:Ma, this is Marguerite.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I'm pleased to meet you.
OTHERMALE:Won't you join us? Yeah, and pour me some of that champagne.
LEADMALE:I never know if I'm gonna make it to New Year's.
LEADMALE:So, what are we celebrating? Did The Supremes get back together? Ma, you know, I really think you should go and lie down.
SUPFEMALE:You look exhausted.
LEADMALE:Hey, I'm 80.
LEADFEMALE:I look like this in the middle of a dead sleep.
LEADFEMALE:So, what's your claim to fame?
SUPMALE:I'm the housekeeper.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? You always wear a tiara to clean the toilet? Ma, could I see you in the kitchen? Hey, take it easy! I'm not Gumby! What's going on? Ma, I want you to be especially nice to Marguerite.
LEADMALE:Please, Dorothy, I wasn't brought up in a cave.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, I was brought up in a cave.
SUPMALE:Listen, Ma, I am serious.
LEADFEMALE:You are not to ask her to lift a finger.
LEADMALE:And if there's anything you need, you let me or one of the girls know.
LEADMALE:Let me get this straight.
LEADMALE:She's the housekeeper, right?
LEADFEMALE:Right.
OTHERFEMALE:She's not to lift a finger?
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Anything needs to be done, you take care of it? Right.
LEADMALE:Where are you going, Ma? To get a job as a housekeeper.
SUPMALE:Ma, Ma, be serious now.
SUPMALE:Marguerite is dangerous.
SUPMALE:She put a curse on us.
LEADMALE:And I'm the one that got put in a home? I know it's unbelievable but we fired her, she put a curse on us, so we had to hire her back.
LEADFEMALE:Now, if we can just keep her happy, maybe she'll leave us alone.
SUPMALE:You really are afraid of her? Ma, Ma, it's unbelievable but please go along with it, okay? I mean, do it for me.
OTHERFEMALE:If it means that much to you, pussycat, you got it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks.
SUPMALE:Now, remember, not a word.
SUPMALE:So, what's all this crap about you putting a curse on my daughter?
SUPFEMALE:Sophia.
OTHERMALE:We'll be turned into kumquats.
LEADMALE:What is she talking about?
SUPFEMALE:Don't play dumb with me.
SUPMALE:I've been known to cast a curse myself.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think Shelley Long was really tired of playing in Cheers? Wrong, baby.
OTHERMALE:I was tired of her.
LEADFEMALE:Is that what this is all about? You think I put a curse on you? It's true, you got mad at us for firing you.
SUPMALE:That's why you reversed that love potion you gave me.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, that wasn't love potion.
LEADFEMALE:That was Chanel No.
LEADMALE:5.
SUPMALE:I'm not buying that.
LEADMALE:Dorothy uses Chanel No.
SUPFEMALE:5 all the time and she never attracts men.
LEADFEMALE:What about this painted rock that you put under my bed? Oh, thank God you found it! This is very special to me.
LEADFEMALE:It was the first wage I ever earned.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, they paid you in rocks? Hey, don't knock it.
OTHERMALE:To this day in some parts of Sardinia, two of these will get you a veal and pepper sandwich.
LEADMALE:Then you lied to me about it's helping me to sleep.
LEADMALE:Okay, I figured that you'd be angry because I didn't sweep under the bed.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, you're really a good liar.
LEADMALE:I know, that's why I'm studying to be a lawyer.
SUPMALE:See, I'm going to school at night and the only time I have to study is when you all go out in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:That's why the toilets don't get the attention they probably deserve.
LEADFEMALE:Then everything was just a misunderstanding and Norman really did dump me for a fat woman.
LEADMALE:No kidding? Fatter than you? I hate to burst your bubble but I just wanted a job.
SUPMALE:The truth is I don't have any magical powers.
LEADFEMALE: Boy, have I been stupid.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't felt this dumb since I found out William Conrad wasn't one guy in a jacket and another guy in a pair of pants.
LEADMALE:Well, Marguerite, I guess we just let our superstitions get the best of us and I think we owe you an apology.
LEADMALE:No, no, I owe you an apology.
LEADFEMALE:You're right, I'm a lousy housekeeper.
LEADMALE: I feel like such a silly goose.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye, ladies.
OTHERMALE:And I'm really sorry for all the trouble, but thank you for being understanding.
SUPFEMALE:And thank you for taking care of that Shelley Long.
OTHERMALE:I'm tired of that thin, uppity white woman, too.
LEADMALE: Well, that's that.
SUPFEMALE:Anything else you need me to straighten out for you? No, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:So, tell me, how was the wedding? Beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Until the bride lifted her veil.
LEADFEMALE:I shudder to think what was under that dress.
SUPMALE:
