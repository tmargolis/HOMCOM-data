SUPFEMALE:Oh, it's a mess! This place is just a mess! Rose, what am I gonna do? She's gonna be here any minute.
LEADFEMALE:- This place is a pigsty! - Oh, Blanche, it looks gorgeous.
OTHERMALE:Don't sit! I just fluffed! - Honey, dust the table.
LEADFEMALE:- I just did.
LEADFEMALE:Well, do it again.
LEADMALE:God, I wish she wasn't coming.
OTHERMALE:I just hate her.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you hate your sister.
LEADFEMALE:I despise her.
LEADMALE:Oh, I wish I'd gotten a decorator.
LEADFEMALE:Nancy Reagan's decorator.
LEADFEMALE:That'd kill my sister.
LEADFEMALE:She's your sister.
LEADMALE:How can you hate your sister? Because she made me and my big sister Charmaine miserable our entire lives.
LEADFEMALE:I never heard of such a thing.
OTHERFEMALE:You never heard of anybody hating their sister? Never.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe it's Southern.
SUPMALE:Sleeping with your brothers is Southern.
SUPFEMALE:Dust, Rose, dust! We're running out of time.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia if you hated your sister, would you clean the house? I'd put Vaseline on the tips of her walker.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody, look what I have.
LEADMALE:- Where did you find? - Oh! Don't sit! Don't sit! - Oh, what is our name? - This is Danny.
OTHERMALE:- Dorothy, what in the world is that? - It's a flounder, Blanche.
LEADMALE:- What do you think it is? - What's that baby doing here? It's Lucy and Ted's baby.
LEADMALE:Ted had a little accident waterskiing, and Lucy's taking him to the hospital.
LEADMALE:Now, we cannot have a baby in this house.
LEADMALE:My sister's coming.
LEADMALE:Does she eat them? I have cleaned this house from top to bottom.
LEADFEMALE:I have killed myself for two days.
LEADFEMALE:Babies make a mess.
LEADMALE:In diapers.
LEADMALE:And unless we use them as placemats, your sister will never know.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, Lord.
OTHERFEMALE:- Boochie-boochie-boo.
SUPFEMALE:Oochie-oochie-boo-boo.
SUPFEMALE:Finally - someone she can talk to.
SUPFEMALE:I just hope it doesn't make a fuss when my sister's here.
SUPMALE:- I thought you hate this sister.
LEADFEMALE:- I do.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna put him to bed.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, the ba-bas.
LEADMALE:Why do you hate your sister? That's what I wanna know.
LEADMALE:Because when she was born, I ceased to exist.
SUPFEMALE:I never saw my mama and daddy again.
LEADMALE:Where did they go? They never looked at me again, Rose.
SUPMALE:She was the adorable one, the gorgeous one, the brilliant one.
LEADMALE:She sat in my daddy's lap for 16 years.
LEADMALE:Oh, and she was hateful.
SUPFEMALE:You know what she used to do? She used to bite herself on the arm and then run crying to Daddy that I had done it and he'd punish me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, she got me in trouble all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy used to call me the bad seed.
SUPMALE:- Once, she even electrocuted me.
LEADMALE:- Oh, no! Oh, yes.
SUPMALE:It was the day before Christmas and we were playing and she jiggled the tree and the star fell off and broke.
SUPFEMALE:So she told me to pick it up and put it on my finger.
LEADMALE:And I did.
LEADFEMALE:Then she plugged it in.
LEADMALE:And wham! My eyes bugged out, my hair shot straight up.
OTHERMALE:I did a crazy rubber dance all over the room.
SUPMALE:I'm sure my heart stopped beating for a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Then she ran to Daddy and told him I'd broken the star and almost electrocuted her.
OTHERFEMALE:And he sent me to my room for all of Christmas Eve and told me that the baby Jesus was mad at me for ruining his birthday.
OTHERMALE:- Blanche, that's horrible.
SUPFEMALE:- And that's not the worst part.
LEADFEMALE:That darn electricity straightened my hair.
LEADMALE:I used to have curly hair.
SUPMALE:That was a lovely lunch, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:A lovely lunch in a lovely house with your lovely friends.
LEADFEMALE:Stop making fun of me, Virginia.
SUPMALE:Making fun of you? Honey, I was complimenting you.
SUPFEMALE:- I heard the way you said "lovely.
SUPFEMALE:" - How did I say "lovely"? Oh, you know very well how you said "lovely.
LEADFEMALE:" You said "lovely" the same way you say "lovely" to a date who's just shown up in a light-blue tuxedo.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I meant "lovely" no matter how it came out.
SUPFEMALE:I guess maybe I just didn't think you'd recognize good taste.
OTHERMALE:You know, this house was done by Nancy Reagan's decorator.
SUPMALE:- Really? - Yes.
LEADFEMALE:But never mind about that.
SUPFEMALE:Let's talk about you.
LEADFEMALE:- You look like you lost weight, sugar.
LEADFEMALE:- I have.
LEADFEMALE:Hm.
LEADMALE:You know, at your age, when you lose weight, your skin just hangs there.
LEADFEMALE:Like leaves on a willow.
SUPMALE:I haven't lost that much.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think that's happened yet.
OTHERMALE:Well, I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:But if I were you, I sure wouldn't wave goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:And if I were you, I sure wouldn't jog without a muumuu.
LEADFEMALE:Is that so? Well, just let me tell you something! Oh, Blanche, please.
LEADFEMALE:Let's not do this.
LEADMALE:Let's grow up.
SUPFEMALE:For God's sake, we have done this our whole lives long! Let's call an end to it, OK? Sure, whatever.
LEADMALE:So you thinking about getting a face-lift? For your - how do I put this delicately? - turkey wattle or what? There, there.
LEADFEMALE:It's colic.
LEADMALE:My children had it.
SUPFEMALE:- You give them brandy.
OTHERFEMALE:- For colic? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:After dinner with a cigar.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, you give brandy for teething.
OTHERMALE:You rub it on their gums.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:I thought I gave it to them for colic.
SUPFEMALE:In their bottles.
LEADMALE:Well, my babies were very happy.
LEADFEMALE:Put it in my bottle.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be happy too.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this - pop-ups.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that wonderful? Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Remember when we had to use cotton and fish ointment? That's nothing.
LEADMALE:In Sicily, we use a leaf and the river.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you never had a baby in Sicily.
OTHERFEMALE:I was a baby in Sicily.
LEADMALE:Disposable bottles and formula.
SUPMALE:We had to sterilize our bottles and make our formula.
LEADMALE:I nursed.
OTHERMALE:Your brother was 12 when he stopped.
SUPFEMALE:He wanted to come home from school at lunchtime.
SUPFEMALE:- I got nothing left up here.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, she's gone.
OTHERMALE:That's it? That's why we couldn't sit on the couch for two days? No.
LEADFEMALE:I have to have dinner with her tonight.
LEADMALE:Why is that baby still here? They're still at the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:It's taking a little longer than they thought.
LEADFEMALE:- Blanche, your sister seemed very nice.
LEADMALE:- She was nicer than she's ever been.
LEADMALE:She was interested, charming, caring, loving.
LEADMALE:Just couldn't have been more wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:I just wonder what she wants, the conniving little witch.
LEADFEMALE:You're welcome, Maurice.
LEADMALE:- Let's make a toast.
LEADMALE:- With water? - Well, I can't drink.
SUPFEMALE:- You never could.
LEADMALE:One Jack Daniel's and you'd disappear with half a fraternity house.
OTHERFEMALE:- We said we weren't gonna do this.
LEADMALE:- Well, what else can we do? We never held a real conversation our entire lives.
LEADMALE:- Then it's time for us to start, OK? - Fine with me.
LEADMALE:To us.
LEADMALE:To the beginning of a new and wonderful relationship.
SUPFEMALE:- To sisters.
LEADMALE:- That's very sweet, Virginia.
LEADFEMALE:Now, what do you want? What is it with you? You just step on any kind of tender moment.
SUPMALE:Oh, tender moment, my foot.
LEADMALE:All my life you've taken everything that ever meant anything to me.
OTHERMALE:What did I take? A couple of cashmere sweaters and a poodle skirt? You took my poodle skirt? Was that you? Blanche, that was over 40 years ago.
SUPMALE:Oh, shut up.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe that you are still crazy about that.
LEADFEMALE:It's not over that.
LEADMALE:- It's over Tom.
SUPFEMALE:- Tom? Don't act so surprised, Virginia.
LEADMALE:You knew I was dating him.
SUPFEMALE:Then I had to go to the country to visit Aunt Augusta and when I got back, I had poison ivy and you had Tom.
LEADFEMALE:I loved that boy.
SUPMALE:I wanted to marry him.
LEADFEMALE:We were serious.
LEADMALE:- You only had two dates with him.
LEADMALE:- I was fast.
LEADFEMALE:I swear I didn't think that you liked him at all.
SUPFEMALE:Then I had to be maid of honor at your wedding.
LEADFEMALE:I had to stand there and watch you marry Tom.
SUPMALE:And I had to wear that green dress, which you knew was my most awful color.
SUPFEMALE:I looked just like a swamp frog.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone I ever loved, you took.
OTHERFEMALE:Would it help you to know that Tom fooled around? No.
LEADFEMALE:With who? - Everyone.
LEADMALE:- Huh.
LEADMALE:Serves you right.
SUPFEMALE:- Blanche! - Well, it does.
SUPFEMALE:What goes around, comes around.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, I must have been really bad.
SUPMALE:- What do you mean? - Well, it's the reason I'm here.
OTHERMALE:I knew it.
SUPFEMALE:I knew you had a reason.
SUPMALE:Better be a good one.
LEADMALE:I'm dying.
LEADFEMALE:What? I'm dying.
LEADFEMALE:Well my God.
SUPFEMALE:That explains it, then.
LEADMALE:What? Why you're looking so much older than I am.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, could you eat a little more quietly, please? These are Fritos.
LEADFEMALE:You want me to swallow them whole? - Hi, everybody.
LEADMALE:- Hi, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Oh, the baby gone? No, Rose is driving him around to get him to sleep.
LEADMALE:- Why is he still here? - Ted needs some minor surgery, so they're still at the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:- What about Virginia? - Well - Shh-shh-shh-shh.
LEADFEMALE:- Is he asleep? - You need any help? - No.
OTHERMALE:- We're gonna have that baby till college.
LEADFEMALE:- Shh.
SUPFEMALE:- So how was dinner? - I'm still in shock.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? - I just can't believe it.
SUPMALE:- What? - You never think you're gonna hear that.
SUPMALE:- Blanche, tell me.
OTHERMALE:- She's dying.
LEADFEMALE:- What? - My sister's dying.
SUPFEMALE:- What? - Dying, she's dying.
LEADMALE:- Oh, my God, Blanche! Oh, honey, I didn't even know you were sick! - Not Blanche.
LEADMALE:Her sister! - Oh, thank God! Oh! And she came here to tell you.
LEADMALE:Is that it? No, please.
LEADMALE:She could've done that over the phone.
LEADFEMALE:- It was like I said.
LEADMALE:She wanted something.
SUPMALE:- Enough already! I mean, the woman is dying.
LEADMALE:What could she possibly want from you? My kidney.
SUPMALE:Your kidney? My kidney.
LEADMALE:- Why would she need a kidney? - To feed the cat, Rose! She's going into renal failure, so a transplant is her best hope.
SUPMALE:Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
SUPFEMALE:What happens if she doesn't get your kidney? She'll die.
LEADFEMALE:You hold her life in your hands? - What are you gonna do? - I don't know.
OTHERMALE:I'm glad you're not my sister.
SUPMALE:- I need something to eat.
LEADMALE:- Didn't you just have dinner? Oh, I couldn't eat.
OTHERMALE:I was just too stunned.
OTHERFEMALE:- What are you gonna do, Blanche? - I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, it's not as if she were my daughter.
OTHERFEMALE:She's my sister.
LEADMALE:My sister that I hate.
LEADMALE:I wish I could give her my kidneys, let her get up all night.
LEADMALE:And what if I give her my kidney and then the one good kidney I have left stops working? - What'll I do then, ask for my kidney back? - You'd be an Indian giver.
SUPMALE:I need both my kidneys.
LEADFEMALE:You know what'll happen if I give her one? My ankles will swell, my eyes will puff up.
SUPMALE:I'll look just like the Pillsbury Doughboy.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, that does not happen.
LEADMALE:You can live just fine with one kidney.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't eat this food.
LEADMALE:I'm going to bed.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just think about it tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:All I know is, girls, I'm in a no-win situation here.
LEADMALE:I lose a sister or a kidney.
LEADMALE:Either way, no matter what I do, I'm gonna lose something.
SUPMALE:What would you do? For my children, I wouldn't even have to think.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I'd give them both of my kidneys.
SUPFEMALE:I'd cut 'em out myself.
LEADFEMALE:Me too.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd give them my heart.
SUPFEMALE:I'd give to all my children, except Phil.
OTHERMALE:- Why not Phil? - Because he never calls, he never writes.
LEADMALE:I only hear from him at Christmas when he sends me a cheddar cheese nativity scene.
OTHERMALE:I'm Catholic.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't spread a wise man on a Ritz cracker.
LEADMALE:If I still had my dog Fluffy, I'd give to him.
LEADMALE:- You'd give what to Fluffy? - My kidney.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:You'd give a kidney to a dog? - Absolutely.
SUPMALE:- So he could whiz on your rug? I would give to him because of everything he gave to me.
OTHERFEMALE:He was loving, he was loyal, he was fun.
LEADMALE:He never left my side.
LEADFEMALE:I wish my ex had been like Fluffy.
SUPFEMALE:Would've solved a lot of problems.
SUPFEMALE:You could've had him fixed.
LEADMALE:Oh, poor Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I know you need some time to think it over.
LEADMALE:You're damn right I do.
SUPMALE:We're talking about a vital organ in my body here.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:- You gonna give it to her or not? - Sophia.
OTHERFEMALE:What does it mean - a little less bourbon? It's a big decision, Sophia.
OTHERFEMALE:She's got to think about it.
LEADMALE:She's family.
SUPFEMALE:If you can't count on family, who the hell can you count on? She's Italian.
LEADMALE:I'll understand, you know, if you decide not to.
LEADMALE:How come you didn't ask Charmaine for her kidney? You were always closer to Charmaine.
SUPFEMALE:Charmaine's kidneys are attached to each other.
LEADMALE:- What do you mean, attached? - The two are joined.
LEADMALE:It's like having one big kidney, and you can't separate 'em.
LEADMALE:Leave it to Charmaine.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:She never could help Mama because she had heart flutters, and she never could take gym class, no, because she had a tipped uterus, and she never did any housework because she had a spastic colon.
LEADMALE:Now, she has attached kidneys.
LEADMALE:That girl is some kind of mutant.
LEADMALE:I'd give you one of my kidneys, but I'm sure you'd rather have one you can control.
LEADFEMALE:- Thank you, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:- Welcome.
OTHERMALE:Look, if you decide not to, I'll understand.
LEADMALE:I swear.
LEADMALE:Sure, you'll be dead.
LEADFEMALE:And everybody will say Blanche killed her.
SUPFEMALE:What I'm trying to say is it's a terrible choice I've given you.
SUPFEMALE:I don't even know what I would do under the same circumstances.
LEADFEMALE:Are you saying you don't know if you'd give me a kidney? No, I don't.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm not surprised.
LEADFEMALE:You never even lent me a Kleenex.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, I'm a size eight - your kidney wouldn't fit me.
LEADFEMALE:There's not room in my body for your kidney.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I guess I'd better be going, and if you decide to go ahead with it, I'll see you in Atlanta in a few days.
LEADMALE:- Are you scared? - Terrified.
OTHERFEMALE:- I guess anybody would be.
LEADMALE:- I guess.
SUPMALE:Blanche, whatever happens I love you.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
OTHERFEMALE:The doctor says it's the first time he'd ever been called because a baby was sleeping in the day.
LEADFEMALE:And then I think he called me an idiot.
SUPFEMALE:He sleeps in the day because he has four women who won't let him sleep at night.
SUPMALE:Now, who went in there last night? Was it you? - Well, I went in once.
LEADFEMALE:- Why? - I was working.
LEADMALE:I hadn't seen him all day.
LEADFEMALE:- And was he sleeping? At first.
SUPFEMALE:This has got to stop.
LEADMALE:No wonder that baby didn't sleep.
LEADFEMALE:He wasn't the only one who was up all night.
OTHERMALE:- You were too? - Yes.
LEADFEMALE:- I had time to do a lot of thinking.
LEADFEMALE:- And? - And of course I'm gonna do it.
LEADFEMALE:- Aw, Blanche, you're a brave lady.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, you really are, honey.
LEADFEMALE:- No, I have to.
LEADMALE:I don't want my sister to die.
SUPMALE:I want her to live.
OTHERMALE:And not just for her, for me.
LEADMALE:I wanna get to know her like a grownup.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I want us to have a chance to be friends, sisters.
LEADFEMALE:After all, she's the only family I have.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you had a sister, Charmaine.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you can't count her! Why, she's an awful, selfish, neurotic woman who made me and Virginia miserable our entire lives.
LEADMALE:I gotta go pack.
SUPMALE:- I hate to give him back.
OTHERFEMALE:- Goodbye, Danny.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, pussycat.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, little fella.
LEADFEMALE:What are you carrying on? It's like talking to a salami.
LEADMALE:Well, he has to leave.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADMALE:- Say bye-zee-bye! - Bye, darling.
LEADMALE:You be good now.
LEADMALE:I'm worried about Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:I wish she'd let one of us go with her.
SUPFEMALE:Not me.
LEADMALE:I hate hospitals.
LEADMALE:My friend Matty Fishbein went into the hospital a healthy guy.
OTHERFEMALE:Then boom, boom - dead, just like that, in his sleep.
SUPFEMALE:I don't like hospitals either.
LEADFEMALE:They're full of germs.
LEADFEMALE:I always hold my breath in the elevators 'cause there are sick people in the elevators and it's such a small space.
SUPMALE:Once, I had to go to the eighth floor in a hospital, and the elevator stopped on every floor, and I had to hold my breath all that time.
SUPFEMALE:And I finally fainted and I hit my head and I had to stay there because I had a concussion, and I had to hold my breath all the way down in the elevator to the emergency room.
SUPMALE:Then I had to hold my breath in the x-ray, where they ask you to hold your breath anyway.
OTHERMALE:And then after I have great news.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:We'll get back to your fascinating hospital story later.
LEADFEMALE:Ted and Lucy said that we could have the baby again next month - when they go away for a weekend.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, that's wonderful.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm so excited.
OTHERMALE:Hello, everybody.
LEADMALE:Blanche, what are you doing here? Is something wrong? I mean, we didn't expect you back so soon.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, the best possible thing has happened.
SUPFEMALE:I still have both my kidneys and my sister's fine.
LEADMALE:Blanche, how is that possible? They couldn't use my kidney - my blood vessels were too small.
SUPMALE:Of course they're too small.
LEADFEMALE:I've always been very petite.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, Virginia.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, the most wonderful thing happened.
SUPFEMALE:They found a donor, an excellent match.
LEADMALE:She was a retired Mormon schoolteacher.
LEADMALE:Virginia's so lucky! Oh, I'll say.
SUPMALE:That kidney was showroom-new.
LEADMALE:Why, the wildest thing that ever passed through there was Ovaltine.
LEADFEMALE:But the best part of it was that hunk of a doctor who examined me - he's gonna be in Florida in a few weeks.
LEADFEMALE:Wherever she goes, she finds a man! So do hookers.
SUPFEMALE:But the most wonderful thing about all this is Virginia and me.
OTHERMALE:All that time we wasted hating each other from when we were kids.
LEADFEMALE:Now we're getting to know each other, and I just love her.
OTHERMALE:I finally have a sister to love.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't it funny? Sometimes you have to almost lose somebody before you realize how much they really mean to you.
SUPMALE:Let's go out and celebrate life.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go out and do something crazy! Let's fly to Freeport and gamble all night.
LEADMALE:Ma, we can't afford it.
LEADMALE:Let's drive to Disney World and ride the Teacups! Oh, too wild, Rose.
LEADMALE:Hey, I know a bar over in Coco Beach where you can pick up over-the-hill astronauts.
LEADMALE:Ow! Or there's some Rocky Road in the freezer.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, great! 
LEADMALE:
