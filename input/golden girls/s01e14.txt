SUPFEMALE:Who was known as the world's fastest human being?
SUPMALE:Dominic Tansey.
LEADMALE:It says Jesse Owens here.
LEADMALE:Trust me, it was Dominic Tansey.
SUPMALE:He got four women pregnant in one night.
LEADMALE:Two in New York, two in New Jersey.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, I am so excited! I am finally going to do something you've heard me talk about doing for years! You decided to install a trapeze over your bed.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Actually, I'm talking about this car.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, it's beautiful!
SUPFEMALE:Can you afford a car like this?
LEADMALE:Only if I can unload my old one.
LEADMALE:Oh, that won't be any problem.
LEADFEMALE:That's a wonderful car.
OTHERMALE:Rose, you need a car.
LEADMALE:Why don't you buy it? No, no, I couldn't sell my car to Rose.
LEADFEMALE:She's my friend.
LEADMALE:My great granddaddy always used to say, there are two things you never sell to a friend
LEADFEMALE:a car and a slave.
OTHERFEMALE:'Cause if either one of them quits working, you'll never hear the end of it.
LEADFEMALE:" 'Course they hanged my great granddaddy.
LEADFEMALE:He said a lot of things he shouldn't have.
LEADMALE:What'll you give me for it?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I couldn't buy your car.
LEADFEMALE:It's not my type.
SUPMALE:I want a car that says "practical.
LEADFEMALE:" Your car says "available.
LEADMALE:" Well, just take off my personalized plates! Rose, I'll tell you what.
SUPFEMALE:Take the car for two weeks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh
LEADFEMALE:Just try it out.
LEADMALE:If you don't absolutely love it, I'll take it back.
SUPFEMALE:Well
LEADMALE:No questions asked.
LEADFEMALE:What the heck, you only live once.
LEADFEMALE:Might as well be daring! Rose, it's a used car
LEADMALE:it's not a seat on the space shuttle.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I need you to give me a manicure.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, I need you to lend me your pearls.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, I need you to stay off my back.
SUPFEMALE:What? What'd I do? I am going out with a new man tonight and he is not Italian.
LEADMALE:Oh, who is he, Dorothy?
SUPMALE:Oh, his name is Glen O'Brien.
LEADMALE:Where'd you meet him?
LEADFEMALE:His name is O'Brien.
LEADMALE:Two to one, she met him at a gin mill.
OTHERMALE:He's a teacher at the school where I've been subbing.
LEADFEMALE:A gorgeous gym teacher.
LEADMALE:Ooh I noticed him a few times and today, as luck would have it, I found myself right behind him in the line in the cafeteria.
LEADFEMALE:After I butted ahead of 25 students.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, we started talking and in 30 seconds, I was in love.
SUPMALE:And he asked you out?
OTHERMALE:Yes! We're going out to dinner tonight! I cannot believe how excited I am! I mean, he's practically a stranger, and I am crazy about him! I haven't felt this way about a man ever before.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, you've been hit by the thunderbolt! Love at first sight! It happened to me once.
LEADMALE:Once? You've been hit by more lightning than the World Trade Center!
OTHERMALE:I was hit by the thunderbolt once.
SUPMALE:Probably a direct hit to the forehead.
LEADMALE:It was the first time I saw my Charlie.
LEADFEMALE:I was seven and he was eight.
LEADMALE:It was a hot Minnesota summer and he had put up one of those little stands on the sidewalk.
LEADMALE:Selling lemonade.
OTHERMALE:Insurance.
LEADFEMALE:And I bought a nickel policy on my red wagon.
OTHERMALE:And right after that, my wagon was destroyed.
LEADMALE:How?
OTHERMALE:Some hogs trampled it.
OTHERFEMALE:I was hauling home a smoked ham for Mama and I think it set them off.
SUPMALE:Anyway, that's when I fell in love with Charlie.
LEADMALE:He paid for a new wagon
OTHERFEMALE:even though my policy didn't cover acts of swine.
LEADMALE:"Acts of swine.
LEADFEMALE:"
LEADFEMALE:It's amazing.
LEADFEMALE:What's amazing? Oh, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:A lot of things.
LEADMALE:Like?
LEADMALE:Like you.
SUPFEMALE:Hardly.
OTHERMALE:Like me.
OTHERMALE:Definitely.
LEADFEMALE:Like us.
LEADMALE:These past three weeks have been amazing.
LEADMALE:They have been pretty amazing.
LEADFEMALE:It's amazing that I just made love in the daylight.
OTHERMALE:Why is that amazing? Can't hide anything in the daytime.
LEADMALE:At night, I could be Godzilla, you'd be thrilled.
SUPFEMALE:I'm thrilled, period.
SUPFEMALE:Everything about you thrills me.
SUPFEMALE:And that's amazing.
LEADMALE:You know, every time you tell me you love me, I turn around to see who you're talking to.
LEADMALE:I can't believe it.
SUPMALE:Believe it.
LEADMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:And everything that I used to worry about in you know I didn't worry about with you.
LEADMALE:Like? Like, like, how do I look, how do I sound is my breath bad what's jiggling.
SUPFEMALE:Well, let's see.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, and you.
LEADFEMALE:You are amazing.
SUPMALE:You are warm and loving and caring and smart and funny and I don't have to wear flats when I go out with you.
LEADMALE:I have an idea.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's cut school tomorrow and go to the Bahamas and not leave our hotel room until the board of health threatens us.
LEADFEMALE:I can't do it.
LEADMALE:Forget the Bahamas.
OTHERFEMALE:How about dinner? Dorothy, listen.
SUPMALE:What?
SUPFEMALE:I have to tell you something.
LEADFEMALE:What? What, what, what?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, boy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, God.
LEADMALE:I'm married.
LEADMALE:What? It's not a good marriage, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:It was over years ago.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe this.
LEADMALE:You lied to me.
OTHERMALE:No, I didn't lie.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling you now.
LEADMALE:I'm getting out of here.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Let go of me.
SUPMALE:No, you got to listen.
LEADFEMALE:Please, you have to listen!
SUPFEMALE:Listen to what, listen to what? How your wife doesn't understand you? How you stayed because of the children? I did stay for the children.
SUPMALE:My wife would have moved them back to her home.
LEADMALE:My kids would have been clear across the country.
LEADMALE:I couldn't bear to lose them, so I stayed.
LEADFEMALE:Your children are over 30.
LEADMALE:You're still staying for them? I couldn't leave her because of all the things Look, I don't want to hear about it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God, I'm storming out to the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:Will you look at what we have? We make each other happy.
SUPFEMALE:You lied to me.
LEADMALE:I couldn't lie to you, that's why I told you.
LEADMALE:Don't end this, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:You mean everything to me.
LEADFEMALE:It's over with my wife.
SUPFEMALE:It's just hard to walk out, is all.
LEADFEMALE:Well, not for me it isn't.
OTHERMALE:Hi, girls.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Rose.
SUPMALE:Oh, Blanche, you remember a few days ago when I said your car was making a funny kind of a noise sometimes?
SUPMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:It's making it all the time now.
LEADFEMALE:It's nothing serious, I'm sure.
LEADMALE:It started making a wheezing, coughing, rattling kind of a sound
LEADFEMALE:every time it goes up a hill.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's a bad sign.
LEADMALE:Those are the sounds Tony Triano made the night they wheeled him out of the home on a gurney.
OTHERMALE:That car's in terrific condition.
SUPMALE:Sometimes it's a little hard to turn over in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:Tony Triano to a T.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe I should have a mechanic check it out.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Rose, wake up and smell the coffee.
LEADFEMALE:An auto mechanic is the last person to take a car to.
LEADMALE:They only make money if they tell you there's something wrong with it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's a good point.
OTHERMALE:Boy, I wish I had a car to sell.
LEADMALE: I'll get it.
OTHERMALE:Hello? It's for Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I think it's Glen.
OTHERMALE:That's the fourth time he's called today.
LEADMALE:Well, you know what we're supposed to tell him.
OTHERFEMALE:Go on.
SUPMALE:Hello? Dorothy's not home and she's never coming home again.
LEADMALE:Now, don't call here anymore.
OTHERMALE:This is Rose, who's this? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Yamamoto from the school district?
LEADMALE:Rose.
LEADMALE:I'm so sorry.
LEADMALE:I thought you were the man Dorothy's having the affair with.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, the man Dorothy said is always so fair with her.
LEADMALE:Of course, I would expect you to be fair.
SUPMALE:And polite.
OTHERMALE:And good at math.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so glad you got your own Disneyland.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, ah, thank you.
SUPMALE:Goodbye.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, Dorothy? Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Yamamoto just called about a teaching job.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm not ready to go back to work yet.
LEADFEMALE:Are you depressed about Glen? No, I'm depressed because Phyllis George left the morning news.
SUPMALE:Of course I'm depressed about Glen.
SUPMALE:For three weeks he made me the happiest woman in the world.
OTHERMALE:This past week without him has just been miserable.
SUPMALE:At least you have the comfort of knowing you did the right thing.
LEADFEMALE:Then why do I feel so rotten? Dorothy, he's married.
LEADMALE:You have to forget him!
LEADFEMALE:I can't just forget him!
SUPFEMALE:Rose, come on.
LEADFEMALE:None of us is a schoolgirl anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Although, quite frankly, I am sometimes mistaken for one.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:As long as Glen and Dorothy are realistic and discreet about their situation,
SUPMALE:who are they really hurting?
LEADFEMALE:No one.
SUPFEMALE:That's who.
LEADMALE:Blanche, are you condoning their behavior? No, I'm just not passing judgment.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes life doesn't work out the way we'd like it to.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes we have to just grab our happiness where we can get it.
LEADFEMALE:That's the same attitude that broke up Debbie and Eddie Eddie and Liz.
SUPFEMALE:Liz and Dick.
SUPMALE:Martin and Lewis.
OTHERMALE:Rowan and Martin.
LEADMALE:Shut up.
LEADMALE: Hello? Oh, hello Glen.
LEADMALE:Hang up on that bed-hopper.
OTHERMALE:Don't hang up on him.
LEADMALE:That man cares for you.
LEADFEMALE:Hop, hop.
LEADFEMALE:Go with your feelings.
LEADMALE:Glen, I thought I told you I don't want to talk to you.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:If he wants to talk or hop, let him do it with his wife.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't deny your passion.
OTHERFEMALE:It's unnatural.
LEADMALE:Look, Glen, you are making this very difficult for me! No, I will not change my mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Goodbye, Glen.
SUPMALE:Oh, Dorothy, I'm proud of you.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll see, it's not the end of the world.
SUPFEMALE:No, just feels like it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I hope I'm doing the right thing.
LEADFEMALE:You are if you really meant it when you said you never want to see him again.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Let's start supper.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:I'll be with you in a minute.
LEADMALE:Glen? Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I miss you.
LEADMALE:I think we have to talk.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, yes, Mr.
LEADMALE:Yamamoto, yes.
SUPFEMALE:Fine, I'll see you there.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm so glad you're going back to work.
LEADMALE:Yeah, he was thrilled, too.
LEADMALE:Dorothy?
LEADFEMALE:What is this, the Spanish Inquisition? Look, I don't have to defend myself.
LEADFEMALE:If I want to see Glen, I'll see Glen.
LEADMALE:You're seeing Glen? I don't want to hear about it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I don't want to talk about it.
LEADMALE:Good night.
OTHERMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing up so late?
SUPMALE:I was hungry.
SUPMALE:I was making myself a sandwich.
LEADFEMALE:Do you want one?
LEADFEMALE:No, thanks, we went out to dinner.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's nice.
LEADFEMALE:So you spent the evening at dinner.
OTHERMALE:No, we spent dinner at dinner.
LEADMALE:We spent the evening at a motel.
SUPFEMALE:A motel? Dorothy! A cheap, tawdry, bare-bulb den of iniquity? We didn't drive to Sodom and Gomorrah, Rose.
LEADMALE:It was a very pleasant place over on Biscayne Bay.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to hear about it!
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to talk about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I'll have something.
LEADMALE:I was too nervous to eat much at dinner.
LEADFEMALE:But I suppose the rest of the evening really built up an appetite.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi! I didn't expect to see you girls up so late.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just having a snack.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy's the one having an affair at a motel.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I just want to keep the record straight.
OTHERMALE:Besides, Blanche has had experience in that area.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe she can give you some advice.
LEADFEMALE:I certainly can.
SUPMALE:In the first place, never check in as Mr.
LEADFEMALE:and Mrs.
LEADMALE:Smith.
LEADMALE:Always check in as Mr.
SUPMALE:and Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Don Shula.
LEADFEMALE:What? That way, you always get a complimentary fruit basket and a bottle of champagne.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy's seeing Glen again.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:And I don't need any advice.
LEADMALE:I can handle it.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I had a third cousin who ran around with a married man
LEADFEMALE:for 15 years.
OTHERFEMALE:Are they still together? Well, they would be, but his wife shot him in the boxer shorts.
OTHERFEMALE:And after that, he just kind of lost interest.
OTHERFEMALE: Iost interest.
SUPFEMALE:Evil is as evil does.
SUPMALE:Oh, will you stop being so judgmental! This is a situation you know nothing about! At least Blanche has been there and she knows what I'm going through.
OTHERMALE:Well, not exactly.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, I've never been with a married man.
OTHERFEMALE: Get out of here! No, it's true! I just never figured a relationship with a married man was worthwhile.
LEADMALE:Good for you, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm no fool.
LEADFEMALE:The husband's always so guilty, he ends up giving the really expensive gifts to the wife! Look, I didn't choose for things to happen this way.
LEADMALE:I tried to do the right thing, but the right thing was not right for me.
LEADMALE:I'm in love.
OTHERFEMALE:And if there are sacrifices that have to be made, I can accept them.
LEADMALE:I'm happy and that's what matters.
LEADMALE:Hi, Ma.
LEADMALE:So, you started up with your married man again.
OTHERFEMALE:How did you know?
OTHERMALE:I'm the Amazing Kreskin.
LEADMALE:I was listening outside the door.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I can't put my ear to the door, but you can put your Ma! I raised you to have respect for yourself.
LEADMALE:Not be somebody's floozy.
SUPFEMALE:Purple rain Sophia, Sophia, where's Blanche? I have to talk to her about her car! Purple rain
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, about your car.
LEADMALE:I went to the bank to get the money.
LEADFEMALE:I can't sell you that car.
LEADFEMALE:But, Blanche
SUPFEMALE:Honey, I can't sleep from all the worry and guilt I have been suffering.
LEADMALE:I wasn't totally honest with you.
LEADMALE:I told you that car was in perfect condition.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's not.
SUPFEMALE:It's a piece of junk.
SUPFEMALE:It's the noisiest thing to come out of Detroit since Martha and the Vandellas.
SUPMALE:When I went to trade it in, they only offered me half the blue book price.
LEADFEMALE:I need the whole amount to put down on my new car, so that's why I tried to sell it to you.
SUPFEMALE:But I can't go through with it! I cannot sell you that car! You can't sell it to anyone.
LEADMALE:Somebody stole it.
LEADMALE:What?
OTHERFEMALE:Somebody stole Blanche's Very nice, Rose! I lend you a perfectly fine automobile, no strings attached, and you let some thief drive off in it! Rose Nylund, I will never forgive you! Wasn't it insured? They'll pay you full blue book.
LEADFEMALE:All is forgiven! I'm gonna go call the car dealer right now and tell him he made a sale.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, was the gist of what you were saying before
LEADFEMALE:that you intended to cheat me?
LEADMALE:Cheat you? Rose, you just analyze everything to death! Ma, where are my shoes? Another date with Mrs.
SUPMALE:O'Brien's husband? Now look, don't you start with me.
LEADMALE:I will continue to see Glen for as long as I please! Is he gonna leave his wife? Ma, Ma, for the first time in a long time, I am really happy.
LEADMALE:So please, leave me alone! If you're so happy, how come I hear you pacing in your room night after night? I can't sleep.
LEADMALE:I have a lot on my mind.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you what's on your mind.
OTHERMALE:You hate yourself.
LEADMALE:I do not.
SUPMALE:My mistake.
OTHERMALE:I've only known you since the day you were born.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I've heard enough, Ma.
SUPMALE:I'm leaving now to meet Glen
LEADFEMALE:and have a perfectly marvelous time.
OTHERFEMALE:I hope he's taking you bowling.
LEADFEMALE:Bowling?
SUPMALE:Yeah, you could rent shoes there.
LEADFEMALE:If you want to grab some dinner, we'll have to take separate cars.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna have to leave for home right from the restaurant.
SUPFEMALE:Glen, forget dinner.
LEADMALE:We need to talk.
LEADMALE:Things aren't working out anymore and I don't know what to do to make them any better.
LEADMALE:You can't leave your wife and I'm not cut out to be the other woman.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, you know I love you.
SUPMALE:I know that.
SUPFEMALE:But it's not enough.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to lose you.
LEADMALE:I don't want to lose you either.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I came back.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you understood.
LEADMALE:I can't break up my marriage! Not now, not at this stage of my life.
SUPFEMALE:If things didn't work out between you and me, I'd be alone.
LEADFEMALE:That kind of risk is fine when you're 40, but I couldn't do it today.
SUPFEMALE:I'm too old for that, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Glen, the risk shouldn't scare you at any age.
SUPFEMALE:And at any age, the loving would make it worthwhile.
LEADFEMALE:You want a safe, easy, comfortable home life and a romance and excitement on the side and it's not for me.
LEADFEMALE:Please think about what you're throwing away.
SUPFEMALE:If I stay, I am throwing away my future.
SUPFEMALE:Now I'll go home.
LEADMALE:I'll hurt.
LEADFEMALE:But after awhile, I'll feel better and I'll go on with my life.
LEADMALE:If I continue this, I'll end up alone.
LEADMALE:And I care too much about myself to let that happen.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, I love you.
SUPMALE:I love you too.
SUPFEMALE:Goodbye.
LEADMALE:Hi, Ma.
LEADMALE:You're home early.
LEADFEMALE:I broke up with Glen.
LEADMALE:I told him I couldn't see him anymore.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I thought you'd be happy.
LEADFEMALE:You want me to be happy? Help me put away the dishes.
SUPMALE:You still angry with me?
SUPMALE:I was never really angry.
LEADFEMALE:I was worried.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like seeing you in pain.
OTHERMALE:Still angry with me?
LEADFEMALE:What for? For trying to stop your daughter from making a mistake? Somebody has to.
LEADFEMALE:You kids get to be middle-aged, you think you know everything! I don't care what you say, you were speeding! I tell you, that is not why that highway patrolman was following us!  Oh, Blanche, please.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy? Oh, I thought you were out.
SUPMALE:No, we ended the evening early.
SUPFEMALE:You and Glen have a disagreement?
SUPMALE:Yeah, he thinks he should stay married.
SUPMALE:You mean it's over? Look, we just came back to pick Sophia up.
SUPMALE:Blanche got her new car! Yeah, and we're gonna all pile in and go cruising.
LEADMALE:Do you want to go with us?
LEADFEMALE:No, I think I'll just stay home tonight.
LEADMALE:I feel, you know, just like sitting.
LEADMALE:Me too.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'll have a cup of tea.
LEADMALE:It's kind of late.
LEADMALE:I'm a little tired.
LEADMALE:I think I'll just stick around.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what the heck.
LEADMALE:That car will still be there tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Boy, this is depressing! Girls, let's go cruising.
LEADMALE:I know a place where guys wrestle naked in the mud! 
SUPFEMALE:
