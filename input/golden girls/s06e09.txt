SUPMALE: Blanche, look at all these flowers! Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:Who died? Did one of us die? They're mine, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:They're from a secret admirer.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, look.
LEADMALE:I got flowers.
LEADFEMALE:Two bouquets of lousy, stinking flowers.
LEADFEMALE:They're from my secret admirer, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Do you like 'em? Every single one of 'em? Oh, it just figures.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, you mustn't feel so bad.
LEADFEMALE:Why, this is a big day for you, too.
LEADMALE:A girl always remembers the first time she gets flowers.
SUPMALE:Rose, I am a woman in my 50s.
LEADMALE:I mean, common sense says that I have gotten flowers before.
SUPMALE:So, Dorothy, tell me.
LEADFEMALE:Are those flowers from men? Are they? Huh? Are they? It doesn't matter.
LEADFEMALE:It's not important that men find your daughter attractive and send her gifts as a token of their affection.
OTHERMALE:What is important is that you know it.
LEADFEMALE:Write it down, all of you.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, these are from celebrities! Oh, Rose, that's private.
LEADMALE:Lyle Waggoner and Sonny Bono! Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:My poor, sweet, dead-end Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:You're sending flowers to yourself again, aren't you? Why is it so hard to believe that I am being chased by two men? Shut up, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Last week, I didn't have anything to do one night/n shut up, Ma.
LEADMALE:So I went to the dinner theater and I saw Lyle and Sonny in a production of Equus.
SUPMALE:Uh.
LEADFEMALE:Our six eyes met, Sonny fell into the orchestra pit, Lyle forgot his lines and went into Under the Yum Yum Tree.
LEADFEMALE:Except for the reviews, it was a magical night.
LEADMALE:Sonny Bono and Lyle Waggoner! Dorothy, this is an embarrassment of riches! I wanted to tell you sooner, but, well, I was afraid that you might not believe me.
SUPMALE:And why should we, Miss Junior Prom 1946? Ma, you promised.
LEADMALE:"Dating the quarterback," she says.
SUPFEMALE:Buys her own corsage, spends the evening hiding in the basement, slow-dancing with a rake.
SUPFEMALE:Would've gotten away with it, too, but while giving herself hickeys with a vacuum cleaner, she stepped into a puddle.
LEADFEMALE:To most mothers, that would be a cry for affection.
SUPMALE:To you, it's just ammo.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just change the subject, OK? If we're done with our journey to the land of make-believe, my secret admirer wants me to meet him for lunch.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, I can't believe you're gonna do it.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, sure, the flowers are nice, but are you sure you know what you're getting yourself into? Oh, come on, Dorothy, how much trouble can I get into in a public place? How soon we forget the Greyhound terminal incident.
SUPFEMALE:Here's a good idea, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:If you really want to be safe, why don't you let us come with you? OK, you can all come.
SUPFEMALE:But you have to promise me you won't do anything to embarrass me.
OTHERMALE:I promise.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I promise.
LEADMALE:I'll try, but if they serve me cauliflower, it's in God's hands.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, girls, there are just shivers up my spine.
LEADMALE:His eyes could be on me right now.
LEADMALE:The tension's unbearable.
SUPFEMALE:Can you feel it? Yes, I can.
LEADFEMALE:It's unbelievable.
LEADMALE:Where's the damn waiter? Dorothy? Lyle! I hope I'm not intruding.
LEADFEMALE:Not at all.
SUPFEMALE:What're you doing here? Well, it's just that we did so many restaurant sketches on  The Carol Burnett Show.
LEADMALE:I was waxing sentimental.
LEADMALE:Oh, by the way, I'd like you to meet my mother Sophia, Blanche, and this is Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, it's me.
SUPMALE:Lyle Waggoner.
OTHERMALE:No autographs.
OTHERFEMALE:No problem.
LEADFEMALE:Ma! If this is true, I'm rooting for Sonny/n you know, the paisan.
SUPMALE:Besides, there's something about this guy that just honks me off.
OTHERFEMALE:So, Dorothy, can I see you later tonight? Oh, I'm sorry, Lyle.
LEADMALE:I'm busy.
LEADMALE:Busy? It's Sonny, isn't it? No.
SUPMALE:I'm just confused.
LEADMALE:I need time to think.
LEADFEMALE:You take all the time you need.
OTHERFEMALE:But before I go, I want you to know 
LEADMALE:I'm so glad we had this time together Just to have a laugh or sing a song Yes, it's me.
SUPMALE:Hey! Seems we just get started, and before you know it Oh, go ahead, finish your meals.
OTHERMALE:Comes the time we have to say, "So long" I hate it when he does that.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Devereaux? There's someone in the bar for you.
SUPMALE:Oh, God.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, girls, this is it.
LEADMALE:Can you see him, Rose? Yes, I think I can.
SUPMALE:He's coming this way.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! He's very handsome.
LEADFEMALE:OK, here I go.
LEADMALE:Hello Oh, my God! No! All right, so he's not a ten.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, honey, please.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
SUPFEMALE:What in hell? Why do you look like that? I don't believe this! What? Blanche, Blanche, who is this? If I didn't know better, I would say my dead husband, George.
LEADFEMALE:Well, George.
SUPMALE:We've heard so much about you.
LEADMALE:Blanche, George followed you all the way home.
SUPFEMALE:You have to talk to him.
LEADFEMALE:He's alive, all right.
LEADMALE:I poked him with a stick.
LEADMALE:Blanche, Blanche, I know this is crazy.
SUPFEMALE:But I talked to him and I really think it is George.
SUPMALE:And I think you should talk to him, too.
LEADMALE:I'm scared.
SUPFEMALE:If you need us, we'll be on the lanai.
LEADFEMALE:And miss this? Like hell we will.
LEADMALE:Shady Pines, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:You're bluffing.
LEADFEMALE:The west wing.
OTHERFEMALE:Right behind you.
LEADFEMALE:Shady Pines, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:This really shouldn't work on me.
LEADFEMALE:George, is that really you? It's me, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:But you're dead.
OTHERMALE:At least you're supposed to be.
LEADMALE:I buried you nine years ago.
LEADFEMALE:What in hell is going on? Well, I guess the best thing to do is just give it to you plain and simple.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I staged my death.
LEADFEMALE: He stained his desk?! But, George, I arranged your funeral.
LEADMALE:The eulogy, the flowers.
OTHERFEMALE:I even watched 'em put you in the family mausoleum.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what can I say, Blanche? Thanks.
LEADMALE:What a day.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know if I can take much more.
SUPFEMALE: Hi-ho, everybody.
OTHERFEMALE:It's me, Sonny.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, God! Is Dorothy around? She's out on the lanai.
LEADMALE:I suppose you're wondering why a man like Sonny Bono Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:On the lanai.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, that is Sonny Bono.
LEADFEMALE:He's a major television star.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, you have been gone a long time.
SUPMALE:I know you're shocked and that this has caused you incredible pain.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you might say that.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't do it to be cruel.
SUPFEMALE:It may seem cowardly, but I didn't know how to tell you that I just couldn't be married to you anymore.
LEADMALE:How could you say that?! It's Lyle, isn't it? I'm just confused.
LEADMALE:I need time to think.
OTHERFEMALE:What's there to think about? Sonny has the eyes of a poet, the soul of a poet.
LEADMALE:Hey, you're through with those furry vests, aren't you? Oh, yes, ma'am.
OTHERFEMALE:Take her.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche! Are you OK? No, I'm not OK! I feel like I'm goin' insane.
SUPMALE:My life's been turned upside down.
SUPFEMALE:Just so we're in sync, it's this husband-back- from-the-grave thing, right? Yes, you twit! My husband who abandoned me nine years ago, and shows up now just to tell me he couldn't stand being married to me.
LEADMALE:Blanche.
SUPFEMALE: Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:I've had some experience in marital discord myself.
SUPFEMALE:Sonny Bono, get off my lanai.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, before I go, can I make just one more plea for your heart? Oh, all right, Sonny.
SUPFEMALE:Go ahead.
LEADMALE:That was it.
OTHERFEMALE:Goodbye, Sonny.
LEADMALE:Blanche, you didn't hear me out.
SUPMALE:I've heard all I have to hear.
LEADMALE:I know this is rough for you, but it's been rough for me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Now you're gonna listen! Nine years ago, I found out that my partner was embezzling from the family company.
LEADFEMALE:He was a clever man.
LEADFEMALE:All the signs pointed to me.
LEADFEMALE:My business was collapsing.
LEADMALE:I was facing disgrace, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I could've stayed and faced the music, but it's just this damn Southern pride.
SUPMALE:It's the same Southern pride that kept me from being a dancer.
LEADMALE:George, please, I've had enough surprises for one day.
LEADMALE:Blanche, faking my death was a mistake.
SUPFEMALE:For the last nine years, every day without you has seemed longer than the one before.
OTHERFEMALE:Now you just say the word and I'll go back where I came from, but I guess what I'm really trying to say is Blanche, will you be my wife again? No, Sonny, I haven't made a decision yet.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, Blanche needs me now.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I have to go.
LEADFEMALE:No, Sonny.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:All right, if I do it, will you hang up? I got you, babe I got you, babe Babe Blanche, can I get you something? No, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, damn.
LEADFEMALE:I just can't believe how much my life has changed these past six hours.
LEADFEMALE:George is back.
LEADFEMALE:He wants to get together.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, pick Lyle! Pick Lyle! Oh, that's Dorothy's problem, isn't it? I just feel so horrible.
LEADFEMALE:Why do men do this? Why do they deceive us? Picture it/n Germany, 1922.
LEADFEMALE:Germany? Were you on vacation, Sophia? Spy.
OTHERFEMALE:Eh, it was a summer job.
LEADMALE:Anyway, while in Heidelberg, XQ-37/n that's me/n meets a man of science.
LEADFEMALE:He gives me classified documents, I give him, well, a peek at the hinterland.
LEADMALE:It's an epic love till it falls to shambles in utter deception.
LEADMALE:He wasn't a man of science? He wasn't a man.
OTHERMALE:You're making this up, XQ! I can't believe that you were ever a spy.
SUPMALE:I can't believe I told you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess I'm gonna have to kill you.
SUPFEMALE:Someone was actually able to deceive me once.
OTHERMALE:Do tell, Rose.
LEADMALE:St.
SUPMALE:Olaf's most famous OB/MAG.
LEADFEMALE:What's that? Obstetrician/magician.
LEADFEMALE:The Amazing Shapiro.
LEADFEMALE:He delivered Bridget.
SUPMALE:But it was so confusing.
LEADMALE:"It's a girl! Now it's a dove! Now it's a glass of milk!" I don't know how he got her in that deck of cards, but there she was, right after the King of Hearts.
LEADFEMALE:"Is this your baby?" You know, ever since the funeral I've had this dream where it's all a mistake and George is really alive.
LEADMALE:And I just feel so happy.
OTHERMALE:We see each other, we run to embrace, but just before we hug/n always just before we hug/n I wake up.
LEADFEMALE:And I lie there for a split second thinking George is asleep beside me.
LEADFEMALE:Until it dawns on me one more time that he's really gone, and I grieve again.
LEADFEMALE:I grieved for that man nine years! How can I forgive that? Blanche, honey, you need to get ahold of yourself.
SUPMALE:What I need is for things to be like they were this morning, before any of this ever happened.
LEADMALE:You know, as far as I'm concerned, George Devereaux is better off dead.
LEADFEMALE: Sonny! Sweetheart! My little cannoli! Sophia! Honey! My Mama Celeste! Of course you remember me, Lyle Waggoner.
LEADFEMALE:Nah, I don't think I do.
OTHERMALE:Sophia, you must remember Lyle.
SUPFEMALE:Sonny, Lyle.
OTHERMALE:What're you doing here? Dorothy, we need a decision now.
SUPFEMALE:So, who's it gonna be? Me or pizza man? Oh, insults from Lyle Waggoner, huh? How many gold records do you have? None.
OTHERFEMALE:I was never married.
LEADFEMALE:Put 'em up! Oh, now, this is ridiculous.
SUPMALE:I do not want two grown men fighting over me.
SUPMALE:Pussycat, how many chances are you gonna get? Proceed.
SUPFEMALE:Lyle Waggoner? You're under arrest.
SUPMALE:Arrest? What's the charge? I don't have time to list all of them, but he's a prime suspect in a major crime spree.
SUPMALE:Where? Palm Springs, California.
LEADFEMALE:It's good to be mayor.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:No, wait.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, have you made a decision? Yes, I have made a decision.
OTHERMALE:Sonny, I think that Lyle is the sweetest, kindest man I have ever met.
SUPFEMALE:What you have done here is a totally underhanded, inexcusable abuse of power.
LEADMALE:Oh, Sonny, the power.
LEADFEMALE:But, Dorothy! Gumba! Ma! All right, now, you kids go out, have fun.
SUPFEMALE:I won't wait up.
OTHERMALE:Do anything you want to her.
SUPFEMALE:Will do.
OTHERMALE:Well, Mel Bushman is picking me up in 15 minutes.
LEADMALE:Blanche, George called again.
LEADMALE:I told you, when he calls, take the message and throw it out.
LEADFEMALE:I'm back to my old self.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche Devereaux has returned! Oh, boy, strike up the gland! How rude.
OTHERFEMALE:You think she'd feel sorry for me.
LEADMALE:To tell you the truth, I don't feel sorry for you, either.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, why should I? My Charlie is dead and nobody's giving me a second chance.
LEADMALE:Listen, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I know what it's like to have a husband suddenly taken.
LEADMALE:I never had a chance to say all those things I would've wanted to say.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you must know how that feels.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:But after what he did to me Blanche, this isn't about getting even.
LEADFEMALE:For nine years you've been missing George.
SUPMALE:Well, he's here and I'm jealous of you.
SUPMALE:Tell him you love him, tell him you hate him, I don't care.
LEADFEMALE:But just see him before he leaves.
OTHERFEMALE:Do it for yourself.
LEADMALE:Do it for all of us who wish we had the chance.
LEADFEMALE: Hi.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Dorothy said you wanted to talk to me back here.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Sonny and Rose and Dorothy are making so much noise in the living room.
LEADFEMALE:So, did you make a decision? Before I can even think about that, there's something I gotta do for me.
SUPMALE:I know this is gonna sound crazy, but I need to ask for your forgiveness.
LEADFEMALE:What? I'm the one who should be down on my knees after what I did.
OTHERMALE:George, the day you died/n or didn't die/n I was home alone when the phone rang.
SUPMALE:I ran to answer it and I tripped over your damn shoes, and I said, "Oh, George, I hate you.
SUPFEMALE:" It was the police telling me you'd been in an accident.
OTHERFEMALE:Never thought I'd have the chance, but I'm so sorry my last thoughts of you were "I hate you.
LEADFEMALE:" Well, honey, you always were fiery.
LEADMALE:I love that about you.
SUPFEMALE:There's more.
SUPFEMALE:Since the funeral, I've been with other men.
LEADFEMALE:Many, many men.
LEADFEMALE:I always felt like I was cheating on ya.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, every day I was gone, I always wished you'd find somebody who could make you happy.
LEADMALE:How-how many men? Two.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, you don't have to ask my forgiveness for anything.
OTHERMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:Good God, you're as pretty now as the day we met.
LEADFEMALE:Remember that first day we met? The University Club Cotillion.
LEADFEMALE:Our eyes met and I knew you were the only man for me.
LEADFEMALE:So when it was ladies' choice, I sent my fiancÃ© off for some punch, and I strutted up to you and I said, "May I have this dance?" And I said, "The pleasure would be all mine.
LEADMALE:" And I said, "I know it.
OTHERFEMALE:" Oh, those damn eyes.
SUPFEMALE:I still haven't seen in anyone else's what I see in yours.
LEADMALE:Oh! Oh.
LEADFEMALE:  Blanche? You OK? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:I was just checking.
LEADFEMALE:Would you sit with me for a minute? Well, sure, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you were doing a lot of talking in your sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:You had that dream again, didn't you? I told you, I heard voices in here, and Oh, God, it's Dorothy! I tell you, she takes one tennis lesson Ma, Blanche had her dream.
SUPFEMALE:Are you all right? I think so.
SUPFEMALE:Usually I feel empty when I realize George isn't here, but this time, it's different.
SUPFEMALE:How? I don't know, the dream was diff Oh, wait.
LEADMALE:I got to hug him.
LEADMALE:You know how always wake up before I get to hug George.
LEADMALE:This time I didn't.
SUPMALE:Oh, Blanche, that's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:It was wonderful, Rose.
OTHERMALE:When he died, I thought, "Oh, the worst part is I'll never get to hold him again.
LEADMALE:" Tonight I did.
SUPMALE:I could actually feel him.
LEADMALE:Still can.
SUPMALE:And you're gonna be all right? Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
OTHERMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Get yourself a good night's sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, just out of curiosity, were "they" in the dream? As crazy about you as ever.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry I'm laughing, but the idea of me with one of those two is just so silly.
LEADFEMALE:You picked Sonny this time.
LEADFEMALE:Yes! Well, good night.
LEADMALE:Good night, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:Good night, George.
SUPFEMALE:
