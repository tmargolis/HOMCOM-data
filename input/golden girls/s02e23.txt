OTHERFEMALE:A few more snacks like that, the only thing you'll fit into is a saddle.
LEADMALE:I'm not going to eat it all at once.
LEADMALE:There's an I Love Lucy marathon on tonight.
SUPFEMALE:I'm setting up for 12 straight hours of classic TV.
OTHERFEMALE:I never liked it.
LEADMALE:Every episode Lucy said the same thing.
SUPFEMALE:"Ricky, why can't I be in the show?" Why couldn't she be in the show? She was a riot at home.
LEADMALE:His show with the club stank.
LEADMALE:What's entertaining about a Cuban beating a drum? Rose, there's an I Love Lucy marathon on tonight.
LEADMALE:You wanna watch it with me?
LEADFEMALE:That sounds great.
LEADMALE:Who's in it? Who's in it? Um Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.
OTHERFEMALE:The Ricardos and Mertzes.
LEADMALE:Don't tell me you never saw I Love Lucy.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I never watched much TV until I moved in here.
OTHERMALE:Charlie and I never had a TV.
SUPMALE:We talked about getting one, but he said it wasn't perfected yet.
LEADMALE:It sounds like to me Charlie was a little on the cheap side.
LEADFEMALE: I'll say.
LEADMALE:Charlie was a wonderful man, but he could squeeze a nickel till the buffalo pooped.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll tell you, there's something to the power of suggestion.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, would you like to stay up and watch I Like Lucy? I Love Lucy.
SUPMALE:I haven't seen it yet, so I don't know how I'll feel.
SUPMALE:I won't have time with my daughter coming tonight.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna be talking about the
SUPFEMALE:Nothing.
SUPMALE:What's the nothing? The nothing is a nothing.
LEADMALE:If it were something, I'd call it something.
LEADMALE:There are more important things to talk about.
LEADMALE:Is that rumaki? Dorothy, you're keeping a secret from us.
LEADMALE:I tell you everything.
LEADFEMALE:I told you a secret last night.
SUPMALE:You're not a natural blonde?
OTHERFEMALE:I am a natural blonde.
OTHERFEMALE:Right, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:You and Tina Turner.
SUPMALE:Did Dorothy tell you she's gonna be a grandma? Oh, Ma, that was a secret! Oh, Dorothy, why didn't you tell us? Because we're not 100 sure.
LEADMALE:I didn't talk to Kate.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma did.
SUPMALE:She had something she wanted to tell us in person and then she had to throw up.
LEADFEMALE:Call me Kreskin.
OTHERFEMALE:She and Dennis have been trying to have children.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dorothy, this is so exciting.
OTHERMALE:But, honey, we're not sure yet.
OTHERMALE:
LEADFEMALE:That's Kate.
LEADMALE:I am so nervous all of a sudden.
LEADFEMALE:I am also very excited.
OTHERFEMALE:I have dreamed about this moment all my life.
SUPMALE:Oh, honey.
SUPMALE:Darling.
SUPFEMALE:Is it my imagination, or was that my ex-husband Stanley? Dorothy, it's me, your ex-husband Stan.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:With that new toupee I thought you were Ted Danson.
LEADFEMALE:I just got it today.
SUPMALE:It hasn't had time to settle.
LEADMALE:Oh, wow, is that rumaki?
SUPFEMALE:Why are you here?
SUPMALE:I just came to see Kate.
OTHERMALE:How did you know she was coming? She left a message.
LEADFEMALE:I was in Lauderdale.
OTHERMALE:Oh, of course, I forgot.
OTHERMALE:It's spring break.
SUPMALE:Do you know why she's coming?
LEADMALE:No, I don't.
LEADMALE:Look at Dorothy's nose grow.
OTHERMALE:Oh, shut up.
SUPMALE:The yutz has a right to know.
LEADMALE:What should the yutz know? Well, we're not sure, but we think that Kate may be pregnant.
OTHERFEMALE:Wow! That's incredible.
LEADFEMALE:That makes me A yutz.
SUPFEMALE:Some things never change.
LEADMALE:You're gonna be a granddaddy, Stanley.
LEADMALE:Wow.
SUPMALE:Isn't life a gas? This is amazing.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me again.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it.
OTHERFEMALE:I am going to be a grandfather.
OTHERMALE:Think about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Part of me will be passed on to that child.
LEADMALE:But we'll learn to love it.
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh, Kate, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Hello, Princess.
LEADMALE:Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:It's so good to see you again.
LEADMALE:You look wonderful.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess you have some big news, huh? Rose, we'll give them their privacy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you don't have to go.
SUPFEMALE:I can speak in front of you.
SUPFEMALE:I knew it.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it.
SUPFEMALE:I just knew it.
LEADFEMALE:Stanley, I'm so happy.
LEADFEMALE:Dennis had an affair and I've left him.
LEADFEMALE:Stan, take your damn hands off me! I'll be honest, I never liked him.
SUPFEMALE:I knew that worm was no good.
SUPFEMALE:What kind of a man has so little respect for marriage that he can cheat on a wonderful woman and jump into bed with the first available bimbo? But enough about you, Stanley.
SUPFEMALE:Let's talk about Kate's problems.
LEADFEMALE:We had no problems, Mom.
SUPMALE:That's why this was all such a shock.
LEADMALE:Not even in bed?
SUPMALE:Oh, Stanley.
LEADMALE:Hey, I'm just trying to help.
OTHERFEMALE:Most men cheat on their wives because what they have at home is less than satisfying.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really, Mr.
LEADMALE:30 Seconds? Mom, Dad.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:We're both being very insensitive.
LEADFEMALE:How are you feeling, kitten? Fine, Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay.
OTHERMALE:A brave front is the first step back.
SUPFEMALE:Bertrand Russell said that.
SUPMALE:Or was it Nipsey Russell? They're both so witty.
LEADFEMALE:You're right, Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not fine.
LEADMALE:He really hurt me.
OTHERFEMALE:I feel so alone.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you are not alone.
LEADFEMALE:You have your family with you.
SUPFEMALE:Your grandma, mother and father will see you through this.
SUPFEMALE:Absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:I have a business appointment tonight.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna call now and cancel and be here for you.
LEADMALE:I don't want you to do that.
LEADFEMALE:I'm fine.
SUPMALE:Alright.
SUPFEMALE:But I'll only be gone an hour.
OTHERMALE:Less than half an hour if she doesn't want dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:Keep your chin up, princess.
SUPMALE:Your chins too, Dorothy.
SUPMALE: You know, I'm still a little confused.
SUPMALE:Now, who exactly is Ricky? Lucy's husband.
LEADMALE:I thought Desi was.
LEADFEMALE:Not on the show.
SUPFEMALE:Desi wasn't on the show?
LEADFEMALE:Desi played Ricky.
SUPFEMALE:Who did Lucy play?
SUPFEMALE:Lucy.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:But who did she play?
SUPFEMALE:Lucy.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:But who did she play? Lucy played Lucy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then, why didn't Desi play Desi? He wasn't tall enough.
SUPMALE: I have never seen Kate so upset.
OTHERMALE:I am a wreck.
LEADMALE:I feel like this has happened to me.
SUPMALE:Like I am the one who had my heart stomped on.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you for all your support.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:It's just that Lucy doesn't know that that's really Fred dressed up as a burglar.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't realize this was more important.
LEADMALE: Rose, Blanche, this is the part where my good friends are supposed to shut off the TV.
SUPFEMALE:So shut off the TV or it's out the window.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:I'm touched.
SUPMALE:How you holding up?
SUPMALE:I threatened to hurl the TV.
LEADMALE:That should give you some indication.
OTHERMALE:Kate seems to be handling things pretty well.
LEADFEMALE:That's tonight.
LEADFEMALE:She's still in shock.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I remember when Stanley told me he was having an affair.
LEADFEMALE:It was at least 24 hours before I cut the crotches out of all of his slacks.
LEADMALE:You didn't.
LEADMALE:I was teaching English Lit at the time.
LEADMALE:Symbolism was my life.
LEADFEMALE:I remember how I felt when I thought Charlie was cheating on me.
SUPFEMALE:Charlie? We'd been married for 18 years.
LEADMALE:And up until then, everything had seemed so perfect.
LEADMALE:Then one night it happened.
LEADMALE:He came home, had dinner, walked upstairs and went to sleep.
OTHERFEMALE:I went in the bathroom and cried my eyes out.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, I don't want to encourage long stories, but it seems in this story you left out the
LEADFEMALE:The story.
OTHERMALE:That's the word.
LEADMALE:Well, Charlie went right to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:We didn't, well you know And he'd promised? No! It's just that that was the first time it had happened in 18 years of married life.
SUPMALE:Get out of here.
LEADMALE:You mean to say that every night without fail for 18 years, you and Charlie Of course.
OTHERMALE:Right after dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Well, no wonder you never heard of I Love Lucy.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, as it turned out, I was just overreacting.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it was a freak, one-time thing.
LEADMALE:By the next morning, everything was back to normal.
LEADMALE:By morning? You mean to tell me, that every morning? Charlie said that's why we didn't have headaches and we both had really shiny hair.
LEADMALE:Listen, Rose, no offense, but I find that story a little hard to believe.
SUPFEMALE:You don't even like to talk about sex.
LEADMALE:In my experience, people who talk about it don't do it very often.
SUPFEMALE:Coffee, anyone?
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:That must be Stan.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, why do they do it? Why do men do it and think they can get away with it? Same reason a dog licks himself, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Because he can.
SUPFEMALE:Where's Stan?
SUPMALE:It wasn't Stan at the door.
LEADFEMALE:Who was it? Just stay calm.
SUPMALE:Just relax and don't do anything you'll be sorry for.
LEADFEMALE:Dennis.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Mother Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe you'd show your face.
LEADMALE:I think you should leave.
LEADMALE:Mother Dorothy
SUPMALE:Do not call me that.
LEADFEMALE:I hate it when you call me Mother Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I feel I should be handing out rice on the streets of Calcutta.
LEADMALE:Where is Kate?
LEADMALE:She's not here.
LEADFEMALE:She said she was coming here.
LEADFEMALE:She left.
SUPMALE:Where did she go?
SUPFEMALE:To meet with Marlo Thomas.
LEADFEMALE:They're going to drink white wine spritzers and figure out how to fry your wandering male behind.
LEADFEMALE:Dennis.
LEADMALE:Kate, we have to talk.
SUPMALE:She has nothing to say.
LEADMALE:Get out.
LEADMALE:Mom, you don't have to speak for me.
OTHERMALE:Dennis, get out.
SUPMALE:Kate, please.
SUPMALE:You don't owe it to me and I'll go if you want.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just asking to speak to you.
OTHERMALE:I wonder how he's going to talk his way out of this one.
LEADMALE:No matter what he says, she'll see right though it.
SUPMALE:Good for Kate.
SUPMALE:That bum deserves everything he gets.
LEADMALE:I'm glad he showed up.
LEADMALE:She can get it over with.
OTHERMALE:You think she'll still see Marlo Thomas? 'Cause I'd sure like an autograph.
SUPFEMALE:Oh  I can't stand it anymore.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you said everybody loved Lucy.
LEADMALE:She's talking about Kate and Dennis.
SUPMALE:How long have they been in there? Since Lucy went to Scotland.
LEADFEMALE:That would make it over 30 years.
SUPFEMALE:It's been an hour, but Kate had a lot to get off her chest.
LEADMALE:You think he'd have the courtesy to say goodbye.
SUPMALE:He's coming back, Mom.
LEADMALE:What? He's getting a suitcase out of the car.
SUPFEMALE:We talked things over.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's okay.
LEADMALE:Okay? Everything's okay?
SUPMALE:Come on, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:What about Lucy? We'll watch it on the portable.
LEADMALE:But that set's black-and-white.
LEADMALE:Dennis explained everything.
SUPMALE:Explained? Explained what? How he did it? I explained that when you were 12.
SUPFEMALE:I can live with his apology.
SUPMALE:He's very sorry.
SUPFEMALE:He'll never do it again.
LEADMALE:I don't want to end my marriage over this.
OTHERFEMALE:I think you're making a mistake.
LEADMALE:Mom, Dennis is my husband and if I forgive him, you should, too.
LEADMALE:Forgive him?
LEADFEMALE:Look, it's my marriage.
OTHERMALE:I never should have come here.
SUPMALE:That was a big mistake.
SUPFEMALE:We'll be out of here in the morning.
SUPMALE:Ma.
OTHERMALE:Ma.
LEADMALE:What's going on? I'm sorry, but I have to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:Dennis told Kate he was sorry for what he did
LEADMALE:and they've made up.
LEADFEMALE:Marvelous.
SUPFEMALE:Get the hell out! Dennis had an affair.
LEADFEMALE:How could she forgive him? Dorothy, please, let me go back to sleep.
LEADMALE:I was dreaming I was being held captive on a desert island by Cesar Romero in a loincloth.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, Kate and I had a fight.
LEADFEMALE:I have to talk to you.
LEADMALE:You know that washcloth in my bathroom? That's how big Cesar's loincloth was.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Ma!
LEADFEMALE:Alright.
LEADMALE:What did you and Kate have a fight about? About advertising condoms on TV.
SUPFEMALE:About Dennis.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe she would go back to him.
OTHERFEMALE:I told her it was a big mistake.
LEADMALE:Who's asking you? It's none of your business.
SUPFEMALE:Kate came to me.
SUPMALE:She came to you to listen.
LEADFEMALE:You should stay out of it.
SUPMALE:I don't know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:Alright, alright.
SUPMALE:Sit.
LEADMALE:Listen.
OTHERMALE:Learn.
SUPMALE:Picture this.
SUPFEMALE:Brooklyn, July, 1949.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, put a sentence together.
LEADFEMALE:You sound like a sportscaster.
SUPMALE:Oh, shut up.
LEADMALE:Anyway, it was the night of your first anniversary.
LEADMALE:You showed up at my house at two in the morning, crying.
LEADFEMALE:You looked like hell.
LEADFEMALE:You told me you had cooked an anniversary dinner for Stan.
LEADFEMALE:He came home late and there was lipstick on his shirt.
LEADFEMALE:You kept saying to me, "Ma, what should I do?"
LEADMALE:Remember what I told you?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Thank God.
LEADMALE:What was it? I forgot.
LEADMALE:You said that if you could erase this one day, is this still the man you want to be with? And you said yes.
SUPFEMALE:I thought to myself, "Idiot", but I kept my mouth shut.
SUPFEMALE:I knew this was a decision you had to make.
LEADMALE:You're saying I should stay out of this mess between Kate and Dennis.
LEADMALE:I said it, used it in a story.
LEADFEMALE:You want me to embroider it on your underwear? Stay out of it! I don't know if I can do that.
LEADFEMALE:Then you're gonna lose Kate.
SUPMALE:And someday Stan is gonna call you up and tell you you have a grandchild who you're never gonna see.
SUPMALE:Good night, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Not tonight, Cesar.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not in the mood anymore.
OTHERMALE:That last episode of I Love Lucy was hilarious.
SUPMALE:It sure was.
SUPFEMALE:I never realized you could have that much fun staying up all night.
SUPFEMALE:Oh? Not even with Charlie? Oh, we never stayed up all night.
LEADMALE:Just seven till midnight and five to seven every morning.
OTHERMALE:And, of course, till noon on Sundays.
OTHERMALE:Lord, no wonder you still mourn that man.
LEADMALE:Morning.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:How are you doing? Much better.
LEADFEMALE:Ma and I talked and I know what I want to do.
SUPFEMALE:For once you'll keep your mouth shut.
LEADFEMALE:If I want things to be okay, I must get it off my chest.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:You'll feel better, but you'll lose your daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, everyone.
LEADMALE:How did you get in? The key under the mat.
LEADFEMALE:Do I smell waffles?
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:Could I smell waffles? What does this look like? The House of Pancakes?
SUPFEMALE:So, how's Kate doing?
LEADFEMALE:Better than I am.
LEADMALE:Dennis is here and she's forgiven him.
SUPMALE:He's here? Somebody hold my hair.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna kill him! Oh, sit down and shut up.
OTHERFEMALE:Good morning, everybody.
LEADMALE:Hi, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I hear that you and Dennis are back together.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:We're leaving for the airport now.
SUPMALE:Kate, I want to say something.
LEADMALE:Yeah? Not to you, to Dennis.
LEADFEMALE:Dennis, I want to speak with you.
LEADMALE:Mother.
OTHERFEMALE:It's alright, Kate.
SUPMALE:Is your name Dennis? I have a right to be there.
LEADMALE:One sperm with a sense of direction and I pay for it for the rest of my life.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I
LEADFEMALE:Please, Dennis.
LEADMALE:I just want you to listen.
LEADFEMALE:Yesterday, Kate came to me, crying.
OTHERMALE:She was more hurt than I had ever seen her before.
SUPMALE:Dorothy
SUPMALE:Please.
SUPMALE:I want you to understand what that does to a parent.
LEADFEMALE:Seeing your child hurt is worse than any pain you can possibly feel yourself.
SUPFEMALE:When they're little, you protect them from the bullies on the playground, and then later you suffer with them through acne and puppy love.
LEADFEMALE:Then the first date, then the first time alone in a car.
LEADFEMALE:Finally they meet someone who will love them and take care of them and they don't need you.
LEADFEMALE:You're not thrilled, but you get used to it.
SUPMALE:And then something happens and you find out there's still bullies on the playground.
LEADMALE:And the old instincts come back.
LEADMALE:That's what happened yesterday.
OTHERFEMALE:I know you have made up, but I still have the same feelings.
LEADFEMALE:Do you understand? Yes, I do.
LEADMALE:I did a very stupid thing that can't be undone.
SUPMALE:I'm going to do everything to make it up to Kate.
SUPFEMALE:I love her.
LEADFEMALE:I promise you that nothing like this will happen again.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Because if it does, I will break every bone in your hand.
LEADMALE:You'll spend your life selling newspapers out of a wagon.
OTHERMALE:Keep it zipped, buddy.
SUPFEMALE:She's not kidding.
LEADMALE:Dennis, is everything okay? Everything is fine.
LEADFEMALE:You'd better hurry.
OTHERMALE:You'll miss your plane.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Mom.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:If you're not doing anything around Memorial Day, visit us.
SUPMALE:How about me?
SUPFEMALE:Of course, Dennis.
LEADMALE:Of course.
SUPFEMALE:You're always included.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, you're hurting me.
SUPMALE:Goodbye again.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, darling.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Dorothy, I'm so glad things worked out.
LEADFEMALE:Me too.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe you're not a grandmomma, but you're still a darned good momma.
SUPFEMALE:Kate's gonna be a darned good momma too sometime.
LEADMALE:How do you know? 'Cause it runs in the family.
SUPMALE:Well, I guess I'll be going, too.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Dorothy, out on the lanai out there, it was like old times.
LEADFEMALE:You and me, a team, united.
LEADFEMALE:Partners.
OTHERMALE:It felt pretty good, didn't it? It sure did.
SUPFEMALE:Where did it go wrong, Dorothy? Oh Who knows? These things happen.
LEADMALE:I remember.
OTHERMALE:I wasn't happy at home under the sheets.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, you're hurting me.
LEADMALE:I mean it.
LEADMALE:You're really hurting me.
LEADMALE:
