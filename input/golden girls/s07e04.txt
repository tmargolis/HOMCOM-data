SUPFEMALE:Morning, Rose, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:What a night.
LEADMALE:Did you hear that racket out front? I didn't sleep at all.
LEADFEMALE:I think Dreyfuss has the hots for our lawn flamingo.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, we don't have a lawn flamingo.
LEADMALE:In that case, we'd better tip the paperboy.
OTHERFEMALE:What's with the photo albums? Oh, I'm doing a family history.
SUPMALE:And I'm gonna need your help.
LEADMALE:You know, I think it's important to tell the grandchildren about their ancestors.
LEADFEMALE:Give them a sense of pride in those who came before them.
SUPFEMALE:Even Uncle Nunzio? Even Uncle Nunzio, but we call the goat a pet.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, Ma, I want you to drag out anything that'll jog your memory about the old days.
LEADMALE:You know, people in St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf are lucky.
OTHERFEMALE:We all had the same family tree.
LEADFEMALE:You can trace each of us back to the same brother and sister.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think that completes the puzzle.
LEADMALE:Wait a second.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you asking me questions about our family? Uh-oh.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna die.
SUPFEMALE:You talked to my doctor.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna die.
SUPMALE:Ma, the doctor says you're healthy as a horse.
LEADFEMALE:Well, actually, the doctor in our pre-paid health plan says you're healthy as a camel.
SUPFEMALE:I assume in his country it's the same as a horse.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Dorothy, for an extra $5, we can get a doctor who sees patients one at a time.
LEADMALE:Wonderful news.
LEADFEMALE:The contractor says he can start building the hot tub tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Oh, this is so exciting.
LEADMALE:So, Blanche, you must be paying extra to get a building permit that quickly.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I'll tell you one thing, the damn government isn't gonna see one red cent of my money.
SUPMALE:But, Blanche, the city requires a permit on any new home construction built within five feet of a standing structure used as a primary dwelling.
LEADMALE:Rose, all this technical information, it doesn't sound like you.
LEADFEMALE:And if Blanche doesn't get that permit, I think they could make her live in a shoe.
OTHERMALE:Welcome back, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:It all happened so fast.
LEADFEMALE:He grabbed her.
LEADFEMALE:She bit him.
SUPFEMALE:He stuffed her in his calamari wagon and sped away.
SUPMALE:And that, dear grandchildren, is how my parents met.
SUPMALE:How romantic, a roll in the squid.
LEADFEMALE:May I remind you, the purpose of these stories is to give the kids family pride.
OTHERMALE:Hey, I'll have you know it was my father who single-handedly invented the ransom note.
SUPMALE:If you're not gonna take this seriously, I'm just gonna do the history by myself.
LEADMALE:Hey, keep away from that.
LEADFEMALE:What are you What's in the box? Mexican jumping beans.
OTHERMALE:Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, Hispanic jumping beans.
LEADMALE:You don't want me to know, fine.
SUPFEMALE:I wouldn't dream of infringing on your privacy.
OTHERMALE:Look, Rudy Vallee! Where? Where? Dorothy, I'm gonna give you till the count of three to give me back that box.
OTHERFEMALE:One By the way, your reflexes are a joke.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, guess what I have under my robe? That guy from the circus? No, Dorothy, my new swimsuit.
OTHERMALE:I'm wearing it to entice the muscular young men who are coming over to install my hot tub.
OTHERFEMALE:Would you like to see it? Is it a two-piece? Yes.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this is just so exciting.
SUPMALE:I love construction workers.
OTHERMALE:Good with their hands, dumb as stumps, and don't mind showing their buns when they bend over.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look what I found.
OTHERMALE:The box! Rose, where did you get it? Oh, I was just under my bed playing, and then there it was.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you know whose it is? Oh, Rose.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Rose, how can I look at that face and lie? It's mine.
LEADFEMALE: Hi, I'm Don Benson.
LEADMALE:I'm here about the hot tub.
LEADMALE:Oh, my goodness, word does travel fast.
OTHERMALE:It's not in yet, Don.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, I'm not here to soak in it.
LEADMALE:I'm a city inspector.
SUPMALE:You can't come in here.
LEADMALE:This house has been quarantined.
LEADFEMALE:We all have, uh Quick, Rose, give me a deadly disease.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:I don't have a deadly disease.
LEADMALE:Well, get one.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Well, we're off to a bad start.
LEADFEMALE:Won't you come in? May I help you? Yeah, I got a call from a Lois Nylund.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's Rose Nylund.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, as in a series of seats in a movie theater.
LEADMALE:Or the flower? Well, yeah, that, too.
OTHERMALE:Rose, can I see you in the kitchen? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you go in and find out? Get in there! Go, go! Excuse us.
LEADFEMALE:I ought to have you horsewhipped.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't even opened the damn box! I'm-- I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I cannot believe you called the city after I specifically asked you not to.
LEADMALE:Well, I couldn't just sit there and be party to a lie.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Rose, come on.
LEADMALE:There're times it's all right to lie.
SUPMALE:Dorothy will back me up on this.
LEADMALE:Right, Dorothy? No, it is not right to lie.
LEADFEMALE:Anybody got a bobby pin? Look, Rose, I have calculated the cost of this hot tub right down to the last penny.
LEADFEMALE:I cannot afford any useless permits.
LEADFEMALE:Now, if he insists I have to have them, it's gonna be on your head.
LEADMALE:Period! Well, I can't believe she said that.
LEADFEMALE:Exclamation point.
LEADMALE:Well, who's to say? Question mark, new paragraph What the hell am I saying? Rose.
SUPMALE:Rose, this isn't my box, it's my mother's.
SUPMALE:I was gonna open it, but I can't.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I'm proud of you.
OTHERMALE:I can't with a bobby pin, maybe with a butter knife.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, you're off the hook.
LEADMALE:Don just made a quick, five-minute inspection and guess what? The permit's only $40.
LEADMALE:You were right about tellin' the truth.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, if there's one thing I'm good at, it's citizenship.
LEADFEMALE:That and guessing the weight of brood sows.
SUPFEMALE:Shut up.
LEADMALE:Well, it's just nice to know there's still people out there who don't think the city's out to get them.
SUPMALE:Somebody moving in? Oh, hardly.
SUPFEMALE:With the three of us renting from Blanche, we're practically sleeping on top of each other.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you can't do that.
LEADMALE:Well, we all wear pajamas.
SUPMALE:No, I mean you can't rent to more than two people unless you have a boarding license.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, well, what the hey? Put it on my bill.
LEADMALE:What is it, another $40? Well, the permit's $80.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, that's not so bad.
LEADMALE:But the improvements you'll have to make will run you about $10,000.
SUPMALE:$10,000? I can't afford that.
LEADFEMALE:Not even if I use up all my hot tub money.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess you'll just have to lose a renter.
SUPMALE:Hey, you got 48 hours.
LEADMALE:For Hey, uh, Don, wait! All right, I'm gonna catch him, but you're gonna sleep with him.
LEADMALE:Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, you're not going to believe what I found in that box.
SUPFEMALE:Look at this photo.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it's Sophia as a young bride.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but that's not my father.
SUPFEMALE:Ma was married to someone else before she married Pop, and she never told me.
LEADMALE:I mean, she lied to me.
SUPMALE:I don't know this woman.
SUPMALE:I--I don't know my own mother.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, here you are, Ma.
SUPMALE:I still have a couple of questions about our family history, if that's okay.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:As long as you don't ask me about the box.
OTHERFEMALE:The box? What box? Oh! It completely slipped my mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:That kind of thing happens to me all the All the All the shrimp you can eat.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice try, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Let's talk about 1920.
LEADMALE:Bad year.
LEADFEMALE:Now, 1918 I said 1920.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, 1920 it is.
OTHERMALE:The year I sailed for America.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, America.
SUPMALE:The land of opportunity, where the streets were paved with gold, and a young man named Irving Berlin was writing songs like this.
OTHERFEMALE:Hit it.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, where's our piano player? Ma, get back on the track.
LEADMALE:Did you date much? Not really.
LEADFEMALE:Then what about this picture of you in a wedding gown with someone who is identified as Guido? Oh, World's Fair, at the "Have your picture taken with a Guido" booth.
LEADMALE:Ma, you were married to somebody else.
LEADMALE:I have a right to know about it.
OTHERMALE:Wrong.
LEADMALE:There are some things a daughter should not know about her mother.
LEADFEMALE:You're always sticking your nose in where it doesn't belong.
SUPMALE:Just like that old dog Sandy we used to have.
LEADMALE:God, your father loved that dog.
OTHERMALE:Can you believe that? After I've bared my heart and soul to that woman.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dorothy, you hide things from her all the time.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but she doesn't know that.
LEADMALE:I am the smartest woman in the whole world.
SUPMALE:And I am the Pygmy queen.
LEADMALE:No, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, what would you say if I got a permit that would let you have as many people stay here as you want? What? Oh, that's terrific.
SUPMALE: Rose, this says I'm going to turn my home into a halfway house for recently released criminals.
SUPMALE:Yes, Rose, you are the smartest person in the world.
SUPFEMALE:Burger World.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, if I use this permit, any kind of scum could walk through the door.
LEADFEMALE:Thieves, murderers, men who haven't seen a woman for 10 years, who've been doin' nothin' but liftin' weights and countin' the days.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, remind me again why this was a bad idea.
SUPMALE:Oh, Blanche, be serious.
LEADMALE:Now, if we want to stay together, we're gonna have to raise $10,000.
SUPMALE:Well, I don't see why I should have to raise any money.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't create this problem.
LEADMALE:I think the moronic Scandinavian nitwit ought to pay it.
LEADMALE:She's talking about me, isn't she? No, Rose, she's talking about Spike Lee.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't get smart with me, Dorothy, just because you're out $10,000.
SUPMALE:Me? Well, face facts.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, we were already roommates when you brought your mother in.
SUPMALE:So either pay up, or Sophia should move out.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, thank you very much, but if anybody is going to put my mother out in the cold, it's going to be me.
LEADFEMALE:No, Rose, forget it.
LEADMALE:She did sort of just dump the old lady on us, didn't she? Oh, now you're buddy-buddy with the moronic Scandinavian nitwit? Jealous, are we? Fine.
OTHERMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:I try to come up with a solution, the two of you don't even try to help.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Just count me out of this.
SUPFEMALE:Well, fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Just count me out of it.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:But it's your funeral.
LEADFEMALE:Nice try, Dorothy, but she'd probably need a permit for that, too.
SUPMALE:Oh, here you are.
LEADMALE:All right, Rose, I have something to say to you now, and I want you to pay attention.
LEADMALE:Listen to me, honey Oh, Blanche, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, I'm sorry, too.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, but I'm really sorry.
LEADMALE:Oh, girls, I am so sorry.
SUPFEMALE:No, we're the ones that are sorry.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, sweetie, get over here.
LEADFEMALE:We're sorry, too.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, we are.
SUPMALE:We're really sorry.
LEADFEMALE:It's our fault, too.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, how were you supposed to know I had an accident in the hall.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, why were you guys sorry? Oh, well, this isn't solving anything.
LEADFEMALE:This whole thing was my fault.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna be responsible.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll move out.
LEADMALE:Rose, you are not going to move out.
LEADFEMALE:Well, somebody has to.
LEADFEMALE:How else are we gonna choose? We could do what they do in Russia.
SUPFEMALE:We could vote.
SUPMALE:Here, it's the only fair way.
LEADFEMALE:I would just like the panel to disregard that accident-in-the-hall thing.
LEADFEMALE:All right, everybody, just write down who you think ought to leave.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know this is a waste of time.
LEADMALE:I'm just gonna write down myself.
LEADMALE:Don't tell us that.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, maybe we should do this.
OTHERFEMALE:It's the fairest way.
LEADFEMALE:All right, but it's just gonna end up being me.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:Good luck, ladies.
LEADMALE:Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE: Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's that.
SUPMALE:Let's eat.
SUPFEMALE:I'm starved.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:How did this happen? We all voted for you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Dorothy, it's your own damn fault.
OTHERMALE:Why did you have to vote for yourself? I just assumed that everyone was gonna vote for Rose, and I--I didn't want a sweep to hurt her feelings.
LEADMALE:I guess that would hurt.
LEADMALE:It does! Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait, I cannot allow this to happen.
SUPMALE:Now, this whole thing was my fault.
LEADMALE:I am the one who must go.
SUPFEMALE:No! Nobody is gonna go anywhere.
LEADMALE:Now, there's gotta be another way.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what choice do we have? I mean Oh, I'll miss you, and you know I love you.
LEADMALE:But it's the only way.
SUPMALE:I'll just have to find some other place to rent.
OTHERMALE:Oh, would you stop saying that.
LEADMALE:Hey, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:The city says you can't have three renters, but what if What if we're all co-owners? Co-owners? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You sell us each a share of the house and we pay you every month, like we always have, but instead of paying rent, we'll be paying the mortgage.
LEADFEMALE:I tell you what.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't we just forget all about the mortgage, and I'll just give you all the house as a present? Yeah! Then I'll just buy all your clothes, pay for all your food, set up trust funds for all your grandchildren.
LEADFEMALE:Throw in a piano player, you got yourself a deal.
LEADFEMALE:Like hell! This is my home we're talking about here.
LEADFEMALE:And it's more than a home.
LEADFEMALE:It's memories.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, this is where I lived with my husband.
LEADMALE:It's-- It's my past, and it's my future.
LEADMALE:As I move on towards middle age, it's all I have.
SUPMALE:You're right, Blanche, it's a lot to ask.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, but it really is.
LEADFEMALE:I just could never sell it.
OTHERFEMALE:Not even to you all.
OTHERFEMALE: I know what you're gonna say, Dorothy, you can't stand to see me go.
LEADMALE:But I've made up my mind.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, listen Now you're going to tell me, "I'll miss you.
LEADMALE:God, how I'll miss you.
LEADFEMALE:" Rose, you have to listen to me.
LEADFEMALE:"You know, Rosie," you're thinking.
SUPMALE:"I sure could use one last St.
LEADMALE:Olaf story before you leave.
SUPMALE:" And then I'd ask, "Shall I tell you about how the St.
SUPMALE:Olafians "were one of the original lost tribes of Israel?" Taxi! I knew you were gonna say that.
SUPMALE:Look, Rose, sit down.
LEADMALE:Now, you are not going to leave.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, we need you here.
LEADMALE:Really.
LEADFEMALE:You're too important here! Okay, that's not believable.
SUPFEMALE:We love you.
LEADMALE: So, who's leaving? Oh, we were just discussing that, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Benson.
SUPFEMALE:I'm afraid that no one's leaving.
LEADMALE:You see, we're a family here.
LEADMALE:Well, not the conventional one, but we love each other and Excuse me, snoop.
LEADMALE:Liar.
LEADMALE:Rhino.
SUPFEMALE:Lizard.
SUPMALE:It's real love, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Benson.
LEADMALE:It's an honest love.
LEADFEMALE:And, yes, we might have secrets that we stubbornly try to hide from each other Python.
LEADFEMALE:Swamp insect.
LEADMALE:But we're a family nonetheless, and you can't break us up.
SUPMALE:Well, as moving as all this is, I can't help you.
LEADMALE:I gotta file my report, and either Mrs.
SUPMALE:Devereaux has to bring the house up to code, or somebody's gotta leave.
LEADFEMALE:Wait just a minute.
LEADMALE:These women no longer live in my house.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, what are you saying? I'm saying that it's not just my house anymore.
SUPFEMALE:It's our house.
SUPFEMALE:I've decided to share the title with you.
LEADFEMALE:We'll sign the deed tomorrow.
LEADMALE:That way you'll have equity and nobody can make you leave.
LEADFEMALE:By golly, you got me.
SUPMALE:Say, Don, why don't you drop back by after the hot tub's in.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:Land.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a landowner.
LEADFEMALE:I've made it.
OTHERFEMALE:And it only took 80 years.
LEADFEMALE:Finally, property.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be planting soon.
LEADFEMALE:Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, this was so generous of you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so touched.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, I just got to thinkin'.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, this house was the home of my family.
LEADFEMALE:But you're right, you're family now.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:So, now it's our home.
SUPMALE:Rabbits.
LEADFEMALE:Gonna raise me some rabbits as big as your head.
LEADFEMALE: Ma, we have to talk.
LEADMALE:I think it's time we settled this.
SUPFEMALE:Get off my property.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, that's enough.
LEADMALE:Now, look, Ma, this isn't our relationship.
SUPFEMALE:Not talking to each other.
OTHERMALE:Ma, I'm sure you had your reasons, but it can't have felt good hiding this man from me all these years.
LEADMALE:Well, no.
LEADMALE:Then unburden yourself, Ma.
LEADMALE:Not just to your daughter, but to your friend.
OTHERFEMALE:Here goes.
LEADMALE:The man you saw in that picture was Guido Spirelli.
LEADFEMALE:He was my first husband through an arranged marriage, which I had later annulled.
SUPFEMALE:And? And I shot him just to watch him die.
LEADMALE:What do you mean, "And?" I mean, that's all? That's all you're gonna tell me about it? We were promised to each other when we were nine.
LEADFEMALE:By most Sicilian standards, he was considered quite a catch.
SUPMALE:And he was supposed to inherit the family business.
OTHERMALE:Oh, what was the family business? Getting even.
LEADFEMALE:So, what was the problem? What, you didn't love him? No, he was a workaholic.
SUPMALE:I had the marriage annulled, and two days after it was official, I left for America.
SUPMALE:Ma, why couldn't you tell me this? Dorothy, I went against centuries of tradition.
LEADMALE:You don't leave an arranged marriage.
LEADFEMALE:I disgraced my family's entire way of life.
SUPFEMALE:I think I'm finally beginning to see.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Then you'll have the decency to lie if anyone asks you about it.
SUPMALE:Of course not, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:It all has to go in the family history.
OTHERMALE:Don't do this, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Don't do something we'll both regret.
LEADMALE:I have to, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:In 1920, your great-grandmother, Sophia Petrillo, became a pioneer in the women's rights movement.
LEADFEMALE:She single-handedly dragged her family into the 20th century by refusing to be thought of as property and demanding instead to marry a man she loved.
LEADMALE:To do so, she had to leave behind everything she'd ever known.
LEADMALE:And that is the kind of courage and strength that flows through your veins.
LEADMALE:Pussycat? Yeah, Ma? You make me very proud.
LEADFEMALE:No, Ma, you make me proud.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you're not waiting for a hug.
SUPMALE:Oh, come here, you tramp.
LEADMALE:
