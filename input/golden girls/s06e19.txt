LEADMALE: Well, it's unspeakable, that's what it is.
SUPFEMALE:Absolutely unspeakable.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, are you pretending you just found your first gray hair again? Dorothy, just because you have to walk around lookin' like an English lawyer doesn't mean everybody has to.
SUPFEMALE:For your information, I'm upset because I had a date, and he canceled.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Was it anybody special? Well, that's not the point.
LEADFEMALE:He might have taken me someplace where I'd meet someone who is.
SUPFEMALE:You know, it's amazing.
LEADMALE:Beneath that thin veneer of superficiality, somehow, miraculously, there is another even thinner veneer.
LEADFEMALE:What am I gonna do? What on God's green earth am I gonna do? You can stay home tonight.
SUPMALE:We're gonna watch one of those John Bradshaw specials on PBS.
SUPMALE:Yeah, we're gonna see if we can't get Dorothy's inner child to shut up.
OTHERMALE:Good luck.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call Mel Bushman.
SUPMALE:Of course.
SUPMALE:Mel Bushman.
SUPMALE:Old reliable.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:Backup.
SUPFEMALE:How long has it been? What, three years that the two of you have been insignificant others? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yes, it has been.
LEADFEMALE:Mel and I have something really unique.
OTHERFEMALE:We're like/n I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:What do you call it when two people get together when they need somebody but don't make demands on each other when they're apart? Out-call massage.
LEADFEMALE:That's odd.
OTHERMALE:He's usually home by now.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he is the zipper king.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe he got stuck in traffic.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha! Tell me the truth.
OTHERMALE:Do these glasses make me look stupid? Let's just say they don't hide it.
OTHERMALE:The consumer show asked me to test these chemically treated lenses.
LEADFEMALE:The theory is they don't fog up when you come in from the cold.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, you wanna run that looking stupid question by us again? I'm just doing my job.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, leave the glasses in the refrigerator, close the door and keep your head out here with us.
SUPMALE:How will I know if they fog up? The little man who lives in there who turns the light on and off, he'll tell you.
LEADMALE:I'm not in the mood for jokes, especially about the little man.
SUPFEMALE:You know he scares me.
SUPFEMALE:It's really been hitting me lately.
LEADMALE:Everybody's job down at the TV station is exciting but mine.
LEADMALE:Well, then why not look for a more challenging position? I did hear something about an opening for a weekend news reporter.
SUPMALE:Oh, what am I talking about? I don't have any experience.
LEADFEMALE:You don't need experience.
OTHERFEMALE:You've got the one thing every TV reporter needs/n hair that doesn't move.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, Sophia, I told the news director I was interested in the reporter's position, and guess what he did.
LEADFEMALE:A Danny Thomas spit-take? No, he's giving me an actual news story to cover as an audition.
LEADMALE:So I was hoping you could help me get comfortable on camera so I'll be ready when he gives me my assignment.
LEADMALE:You know, Rose, that's not a bad idea.
SUPMALE:This'll be the camera, and let me see you interview Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Not me, not me Oh, Dorothy, please.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not good at this.
LEADFEMALE:This is a pretend microphone.
OTHERFEMALE:It's really just a hairbrush.
SUPMALE:All right, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Ready? Go! This is Rose Nylund.
LEADMALE:We're here chatting with my good friend Dorothy Zbornak.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Hello.
OTHERMALE:It's a pleasure to be here.
SUPMALE:So, can you tell me what it/n Oh.
SUPMALE:So tell me, Dorothy, what's it like being a substitute teacher? Rose, honey, excuse me, but I think you should take another tack.
OTHERMALE:I'm not saying that my job is boring Say it, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Say it.
LEADFEMALE:No, I just feel you should ask more probing questions.
OTHERFEMALE:Okey-dokey.
LEADMALE:Let's see.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
OTHERFEMALE:Isn't it a fact that you have a drawer full of retirement home brochures and you're just waiting for the first sign of dribble on your mother's chin to lock her away forever?  She/n She's kidding.
SUPMALE: Your sock drawer, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:You know, the/n the one you-know-who can't reach? I knew you were keeping pictures there, but I had no idea.
LEADFEMALE:You disgust me.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, I don't have to stand for this.
LEADFEMALE:Nail her, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Nail her.
OTHERFEMALE:Remember, a good reporter always gets her story, no matter what.
SUPMALE:That sock drawer is my business.
SUPFEMALE:Look, those times that Ma makes me crazy, I go into my room and have some pretend time, OK? This is Rose Nylund signing off in a sad, sad situation.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:That was fun.
SUPFEMALE:Girls, I do not know what I'm gonna do.
LEADMALE:I called Mel all last night and all of today.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't gotten through to him yet.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, the nerve.
OTHERFEMALE:If you wind up having to read a book because of that man Where can he be? He never leaves the house, not even for me.
LEADMALE:What is this Bushman-ia all of a sudden? This is a man you see, what, five times a year? A man you yourself describe as "Fred Flintstone with a better car.
OTHERFEMALE:" Well, I may say things like that, but the truth is Mel makes me feel young and beautiful and special.
SUPFEMALE:When we're together, we laugh a lot.
SUPMALE:Why wouldn't you? You're both naked.
LEADFEMALE:There's more to Mel and me than just the physical, Sophia.
OTHERFEMALE:We share things.
LEADMALE:I couldn't be intimate with just anybody.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah? What about the guy who painted our address on the curb? You make it sound like it was a one-night stand.
OTHERFEMALE:He'll be back when it's faded.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, Mel's probably just busy with work, not answering the phone.
OTHERMALE:You'll reach him.
OTHERMALE:You always do.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy's right.
LEADMALE:You're worrying for nothing.
LEADMALE:I remember back in St.
OTHERFEMALE:Ol- Hold it right there, Will Rogers.
LEADFEMALE:None of us is in the mood to hear one of those St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf stories.
SUPMALE:Well, then, here's one against your will.
OTHERMALE:But to show you I'm a good sport, I'll get right to the part that'll make Blanche feel better.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway everybody in the village hated Ingmar.
SUPMALE:So we grabbed our torches and climbed the hill to his castle and pounded on the great oak door, but there was no answer.
SUPFEMALE:So we got a ladder, climbed up to the window, and we peeked in, and to our relief, there was Ingmar lying on the/n Oh, wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:He was dead.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God, Dorothy, what if she's right? What if something's happened to Mel? Good going, Rose.
SUPMALE:Girls, I'm frightened.
LEADFEMALE:You gotta go with me.
LEADFEMALE:I gotta go check on Mel.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, of course, honey.
SUPMALE:But I'm telling you, you have nothing to worry about.
OTHERMALE:Way to go, Rose.
LEADMALE:I thought you said that story would help.
LEADMALE:Well, it did.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know how long I've been waiting to get that one off my chest.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:There must be two weeks' worth of papers here.
LEADMALE:Now calm down honey.
OTHERFEMALE:This doesn't say "dead.
LEADMALE:" It says OK, let's get this over with.
LEADMALE:Maybe we better think this over.
LEADFEMALE:We don't have any right to go breaking into somebody's home.
OTHERFEMALE:We're not breaking in.
LEADFEMALE:I have a key.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's see.
LEADFEMALE:"Baldwin," "Baxter" Ah, here it is.
SUPFEMALE:"Bushman.
SUPMALE:" No.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's Al Bushman.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:"Mel Bushman.
SUPMALE:" You know, girls, I've been thinkin'.
SUPMALE:Ever since Mel and I met, I always figured he'd be around when I needed him, but I never thought about his needs.
SUPFEMALE:All I cared about were mine.
SUPFEMALE:I just always figured he'd be available, and he was.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, girls, he's always been there for me.
LEADMALE:I just took him for granted.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, honey, don't do this to yourself.
SUPMALE:You take everyone for granted.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, so far nothing seems out of place.
OTHERMALE:Look at this Exercycle.
SUPFEMALE:It's never been used.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, we've been on it.
SUPFEMALE:Don't ask, Ma.
SUPMALE:Oh, Dorothy, look.
LEADFEMALE:The zipper king's one millionth zipper.
LEADMALE:Ohh.
LEADMALE:I will never be able to look at another zipper without thinkin' of Mel.
LEADFEMALE:Let it go, honey.
LEADMALE:Let it go.
OTHERFEMALE:Mel, is that really you?! No, it's Claus Von Bulow.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mel, it's great to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche thought you were dead.
OTHERFEMALE:She did? I love it.
OTHERFEMALE:What makes you think something could kill Mel Bushman? Where have you been? I was on a vacation.
OTHERMALE:What's the big deal? What made you think I was dead? If Mel Bushman doesn't answer my call, then something must be wrong.
SUPMALE:You weren't there when I needed you.
LEADFEMALE:You're always there when I need you.
OTHERMALE:Well, when you deliver such services, every once in a while, a man's gotta take a vacation.
OTHERFEMALE:All that matters now is you're alive.
LEADFEMALE:You're alive, and we're together, and I'm never gonna let you go.
SUPMALE:Tell me she's being dramatic.
LEADMALE:When I thought I would never see you again, I began to realize just how much you meant to me and how much I've taken you for granted and how many things I never had a chance to say to you.
LEADFEMALE:What I'm trying to say is I realize how much you mean to me and that I don't need anybody else.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna be a one-man woman, and you're it.
LEADFEMALE:Mel Bushman, I love you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm all ready for my big date.
SUPMALE:What big date? You're going out with Mel Bushman.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:Isn't it wonderful? Tonight, Mel and I are starting a brand-new relationship.
LEADMALE:Do you realize how rare it is to find out the person you've been sleeping with is the person you love? No, but you can't go by me.
LEADMALE:I have morals.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, great news.
LEADFEMALE:I got my assignment, and it's a biggie.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, a biggie.
LEADMALE:Real big.
LEADFEMALE:Big, big, big.
LEADFEMALE:Cat show? Dog show.
LEADMALE:Miami's 13th annual.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's right, ladies.
LEADMALE:This afternoon, I'm gonna get the scoop on man's best friend.
LEADMALE:Oh, congratulations, honey.
SUPMALE:I know you're gonna do a great job.
LEADMALE:Oh, I just wish my mother and father were here to see this.
OTHERMALE:Because they'd be so proud of you? No, because they'd be alive.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! My God, I've got goose bumps.
LEADFEMALE:Mel will be here any minute.
LEADMALE:Why are you so jumpy? You've been out with Mel a thousand times.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but now there's more at stake.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's changed.
LEADMALE:It's all new and exciting.
LEADFEMALE:In many ways, I feel just the way I felt when I was a virgin.
LEADFEMALE:You mean, the feeling isn't gonna last long? Are you implying I lost my virginity at an early age? I'm just saying you're lucky Jack and Jill magazine didn't have a gossip column.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma! Please, Pussycat, I'm on a roll.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, Sophia, but I am not gonna let your skepticism ruin my entire evening.
LEADFEMALE:Mel and I were meant to be together.
SUPFEMALE:I wish I could say the same for your thighs.
LEADMALE:God, I'm hot tonight.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna stand for this.
SUPFEMALE:Take it, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:But I'll bet you'll lay down for it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that was just plain rude.
SUPFEMALE:Some people just don't know when to quit.
SUPMALE:Look how they pamper these dogs.
OTHERMALE:They eat when they want to, sleep when they want to, go to the bathroom anywhere they/n Hey, I do have it pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:Now, if I could just get you to crack the window when you lock me in the car Ma, stop it.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I want you to behave yourself.
LEADFEMALE:We're here to give Rose moral support on her big day, and I don't want you doing or saying anything to embarrass her.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, girls.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi, Rose.
LEADMALE:This is Andy.
OTHERFEMALE:He's my cameraman.
LEADFEMALE:Andy, these are my friends.
OTHERFEMALE:Where do you think we should set up? I'm not sure, Mrs.
SUPMALE:Nylund.
OTHERMALE:To tell you the truth, this is my audition, too.
SUPMALE:How about over there? Whatever you say.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever you say.
SUPMALE:The blind videotaping the blind.
SUPMALE:Here goes.
LEADFEMALE:And we're rolling.
SUPMALE:We're here at the 13th annual Miami Pet Dog Expo, where you're going/n All right, everybody, hands up! All right, you, behind the desk, I want the cash.
SUPFEMALE:Everyone else, I want wallets and jewelry! Move it! For God's sake, we've gotta do something.
LEADFEMALE:But he's got a gun.
SUPFEMALE:What are we gonna do? I'm gonna do the only thing a good reporter can do.
LEADMALE:Get the story no matter what.
LEADMALE:All right, now you just point your camera and do exactly as I say.
LEADMALE:Give me the ring.
LEADMALE:Yes! Hurry up! This'll be far enough.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks very much for making this evening a total disaster.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart, give yourself some credit.
SUPMALE:It wouldn't have been a total disaster without you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh really, Mr.
SUPMALE:"No Guy With an Earring Parks My Car"? My God.
OTHERMALE:You'd think an elegant restaurant like that would bring out the best in a man.
LEADMALE:What it brought out was $250 from my wallet.
LEADMALE:It was a special occasion.
LEADMALE:Where I come from, $250 is 5 special occasions and a bottle of Scotch.
LEADMALE:You'd think for all that money, they'd hang a picture on the wall.
LEADFEMALE:The minimalist dÃ©cor is designed to enhance conversation.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing to look at, what's to talk about? I would think I would be enough.
LEADFEMALE:Talk about you? We didn't have to go out on a date to do that.
LEADMALE:You think I'm borin'? No, sweetheart, I think you're fantastic.
LEADMALE:With a guy like me, a little fantastic goes a long way.
SUPMALE:I mean, look what we got now.
LEADMALE:Every couple of weeks you call me when one of your boyfriends don't show up.
LEADFEMALE:I tell ya, "Bushman awaits.
SUPMALE:" We rent a movie, we order some takeout, we talk about you.
SUPMALE:That's entertainment.
SUPMALE:I love that.
LEADMALE:And we cuddle.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes we do more than cuddle.
SUPMALE:Sometimes you stay.
LEADFEMALE:That's the part I like the best/n when you stay.
SUPMALE:Every couple of weeks, you bring a little class to Bushman's place.
SUPMALE:Why, Mel Bushman, are you sayin' you love me? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:I love you the way we are now.
OTHERMALE:But, sweetheart, you start with relationships and love, and I gotta put on a tie twice a week to eat food I can't even see I mean, we got a problem.
LEADMALE:I guess that without thinkin' about it, you've become a very comfortable part of my life.
LEADMALE:When I thought you were gone, suddenly life wasn't so comfortable anymore.
LEADMALE:I really missed you.
OTHERMALE:Nah, you missed knowing Bushman awaits.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I haven't spent this much time thinking about feelings since we rented the Alan Alda collection.
OTHERMALE:Mel, I think it's pretty obvious our new relationship just isn't gonna work out.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think so.
OTHERMALE:Why don't we call it off and go back to being friends? I got a great idea.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you come over to my place? I'm hungry.
OTHERMALE:I'll go to Wolfie's, get some pastrami.
SUPFEMALE:We can rent Out of Africa.
OTHERMALE:We've rented it five times and never made it through to the end.
SUPMALE:I know, but it always works.
OTHERMALE:I do love you, Mel, as a friend.
SUPFEMALE:Like I said, sweetheart, you got a lot of class.
LEADMALE:Life sucks.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mel.
SUPMALE:You run on home, and I'll be over soon as I check on Rose.
LEADMALE:Bushman awaits.
LEADMALE:I didn't get it.
LEADFEMALE:What? I didn't get the job! Oh, Rose, your little dog show not go well? I'm so sorry.
LEADMALE:Let's talk about me, then.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, Rose did something absolutely incredible tonight.
SUPFEMALE:There was a robbery at the dog show.
LEADFEMALE:Ma and I were held hostage.
LEADFEMALE:Rose was the only reporter there.
LEADFEMALE:Well, shoot, I missed everything.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see the tape.
SUPMALE:OK.
SUPFEMALE:This is Rose Nylund for Channel 8 News here at the Miami Pet Dog Expo, and I am an eyewitness to something shocking  people who look like their dogs.
LEADMALE:I said keep quiet and don't move! That handsome fella you see back there with his hand in the air is Brian Kingsley of Boca Raton.
OTHERFEMALE:With him is his best buddy Barney, a basset hound you'd swear was a member of his family.
SUPFEMALE:As we move closer, you'll notice Barney's collar matches Brian's Rolex.
LEADMALE:What do you think so far? I'm glad I wasn't there.
SUPMALE:TV does put 10 pounds on you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm here beneath the information table with Bill Peterson and his similarly profiled bulldog Churchill.
LEADFEMALE:It's amazing.
SUPFEMALE:That bulldog could be your brother.
SUPMALE:But I guess you get that a lot.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, I do.
LEADFEMALE: Uh, could we discuss this later? Wow.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you, Blanche, but there's more.
SUPMALE:The police have just informed me that there was also a robbery by an unidentified man.
SUPFEMALE:Perhaps this little fella knows who he is.
OTHERFEMALE:I did that last part after everything quieted down.
LEADFEMALE:I thought it would kinda tie things together.
LEADMALE: Wow.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't cover the robbery at all? Was I wrong again? I mean, I could have covered the holdup, but it would have seemed like I was giving in to sensationalism.
LEADMALE:I'm a reporter, damn it.
LEADFEMALE:They sent me to cover a story, and that's what I did.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADMALE:Rose, this was the opportunity of a lifetime, a one-in-a-million shot.
SUPFEMALE:How could/n How could/n How could they not have given you the job? Maybe the issue here is one of/n Oh, God, what can we call it? Editorial judgment.
SUPMALE:Really? You think so? Oh, yes, Rose.
LEADMALE:Yes, I do.
SUPMALE:I guess it just isn't the story they wanted.
SUPFEMALE:Damn, you're good.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:That makes me feel so much better.
LEADMALE:To tell you the truth, I'm still not ashamed of what I did today.
SUPMALE:If Deborah Norville stopped for every serious news story that happened around her, she wouldn't be where she is today.
LEADMALE:Well, Bushman awaits.
LEADMALE:You know, I learned something tonight.
LEADMALE:A relationship is more than sex and fun and videos and good times.
SUPMALE:Thank God this isn't a relationship.
SUPMALE:
