LEADMALE:Good mornin'.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, how was your date last night? Oh, it's too soon to tell.
SUPFEMALE:I'll let you know when I send him home.
LEADMALE:Is this for Rose's birthday? Oh, now, look, don't you start with me.
LEADFEMALE:Every Christmas, every birthday, any time we have to give a gift to the same person, you always find something wrong with mine so yours looks better.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't say anything.
SUPFEMALE:But let's face it, those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.
LEADFEMALE:Look at the ducky wrappin' paper.
LEADMALE:And the little stick-on bow.
LEADMALE:Did you get her a Ziggy card? No.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my.
LEADFEMALE:Not Snoopy? I didn't get her a card.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, if you're really so worried about this, well, I'll just let Rose open yours first so you won't be embarrassed.
SUPFEMALE:You know, your ego is so fragile you have to turn everything into a popularity contest.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I have news for you.
LEADFEMALE:Today your worst nightmare happens.
SUPMALE:Today I make you look bad.
LEADMALE:You hate me 'cause I'm beautiful, don't you? There's a man leaving in 10 minutes.
LEADMALE:Be under him.
SUPFEMALE:Coming through.
LEADFEMALE:The Pope's in town and I've got a bus to catch.
LEADMALE:Let's see, I've got my binoculars, my lucky rosary Uh-oh, I forgot my whoopee cushion.
LEADMALE:Ah, who am I kidding? Everyone on that bus will be over 80.
OTHERMALE:It'd be like getting a dog to bark in a kennel.
SUPMALE:What are you talkin' about, Sophia? Oh, the Pope is saying a mass on his stopover here.
OTHERMALE:Ma got two tickets.
LEADMALE:We're going together.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, a papal mass is something people wait a lifetime for.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoops.
LEADFEMALE:"Whoops"? Is that Pope-related, or just another bark in the kennel? The Pope.
SUPMALE:I traded our two bad tickets way in the back for one good ticket way up front.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, Ma, what about me? Uh, I thought about that.
LEADMALE:This is the plan.
SUPFEMALE:We'll get one of those really long overcoats, I'll stand on your shoulders, and And what? Blend in with the circus folk? Dorothy, I need to get close to the Pope so I can ask him to come and bless my friend Agnes in the hospital.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, now, isn't that sweet? But, honey, with all those people, there's no way you're ever going to get the Pope to notice you.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, he'll notice me.
SUPMALE:I'm home.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose, happy birthday, honey! Oh, thanks so much, sweetheart.
OTHERFEMALE:An even happier birthday from me.
SUPFEMALE:You're hurting me, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:Honey, before you do anything else I want you to open my gift.
SUPFEMALE:I think you're gonna like it.
LEADMALE:Oh, isn't that pretty.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy! Oh, a second-hand sweatshirt with my name misspelled on it.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're right, Dorothy, I love it! Rose, that is the original Mickey Mouse Club sweatshirt that Roy wore! I got it at an auction.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my God.
SUPFEMALE:I loved Roy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, there was something about him.
LEADMALE:Woof! Oh, Dorothy, I just can't imagine a better birthday present.
OTHERFEMALE:Neither can I.
LEADMALE:Blanche? Rose, before I give you mine, I just want to ask you one question.
OTHERMALE:It may seem a little odd, but it has a lot to do with your gift.
LEADFEMALE:Has Miles started wearing bikini underwear lately? Blanche, please, the Pope is in town.
LEADFEMALE:I'm serious.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, Miles did buy some bikinis.
LEADMALE:But just the bottoms.
LEADFEMALE:I have been watching Miles for a while, and I think he's going through a crisis.
LEADFEMALE:He is showing all the signs.
LEADFEMALE:Trying to act trendy, trying to be young.
SUPMALE:And if he's also wearing bikinis Just the bottoms.
SUPFEMALE:Mmm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Well, Rose, I'm afraid he may start playin' around on you.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:None of this proves that Miles is even thinking of cheating on Rose.
LEADFEMALE:You're absolutely right, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:And that is why I have hired a detective to follow Miles and find out for sure! Happy birthday, honey! A detective? You're giving the gift of suspicion? That's right.
LEADMALE:He's gonna follow Miles everywhere he goes for the next two weeks.
LEADMALE:Oh, and if you really love any of the pictures, you can get 'em in wallet size.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I can't use this.
LEADMALE:She's right.
SUPMALE:This violates the privacy of her relationship, and I think you should take it back.
LEADMALE:You're just trying to make that old stupid sweatshirt of yours look better.
LEADMALE:Besides I can't take it back.
LEADMALE:I paid in advance.
SUPFEMALE:Can't you get a refund? Well, no.
SUPMALE:I paid with nature's credit card.
SUPFEMALE:You never leave home without it.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, I'm not sure.
LEADMALE:Miles has never given me the slightest reason to distrust him.
OTHERMALE:Rose, he was in the Witness Protection Program.
OTHERFEMALE:He lied about his job, his past, his name.
OTHERMALE:Everything! Well, it is already paid for.
LEADMALE:We're going out now! Outside on the lanai! Uh, yes! Yes, here we are!  We're probably gonna sit in these chairs.
LEADMALE:Rose? Why did we do that? Did it seem odd to you? Well, well, yes, a little.
OTHERFEMALE:But, hey, you're the birthday girl.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I got an idea.
LEADFEMALE:I'm-- I'm feeling a little frisky.
SUPMALE:Did you ever make love in the out-of-doors? Miles, no.
LEADMALE:Well, just once.
OTHERFEMALE:Charlie and I went to St.
OTHERFEMALE:Olaf's most romantic outdoor trysting place.
SUPMALE:Mount Pushover.
LEADFEMALE:But that place was sacred.
OTHERMALE:Not out here, Miles.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Rose.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's not like anybody would be watching us.
LEADMALE: But the others are just inside.
SUPMALE:Yeah, they're right inside.
LEADFEMALE:That's what makes it exciting.
LEADMALE:Come on, live for the day, hmm? Miles, there's a detective in the bushes.
LEADFEMALE:A detective A detective in the bushes! Oh, that's-- that's perfect, and--and you make believe you're the farmer's daughter hanging clothes on the line, see? Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:Places, everybody! Miles! No, no, no, make up a detective name.
SUPMALE:No, Miles, there is a detective in the bushes.
SUPFEMALE:Come on out! Right now! 
LEADMALE:I'm not really supposed to let you see me.
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:It's like a rule.
OTHERFEMALE:Out!  Sorry.
LEADMALE:Rose, what is going on here? Blanche gave me a detective for my birthday.
OTHERFEMALE:How you doing? She was afraid you might be cheating on me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, I see.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, Blanche is a good friend.
OTHERMALE:I suppose Well, I suppose she was just looking out for you.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm so glad you're not mad at her.
LEADMALE:I'm not.
LEADMALE:I'm mad at you! Hey, as long as it's your birthday, how about I get one of the two of you together, huh? Do you mind? Me? Why are you mad at me? Oh, Rose, you should have known you could trust me.
LEADMALE:This is an insult to me and our whole relationship! Miles? Miles!  Miles, big news Later.
SUPMALE:Rose, I've got I'm busy, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I can't breathe! Not now, Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, but this better be good.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:How good would you consider the Pope's ring? Okay, Ma, squirt me in the eye and get it over with.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:This is his ring.
LEADMALE:Look.
LEADMALE:My God, Ma! This looks real! It is real.
OTHERMALE:You think he'd wear his fakes in public like Zsa Zsa? But, Ma, how did this happen? Picture it.
OTHERMALE:The papal mass.
LEADFEMALE:A few hours ago.
LEADMALE:I want to cop a blessing for Agnes, so I sneak into the crippled and lame section.
SUPMALE:Oh, Ma, how could you? With a pronounced limp.
SUPMALE:The Pope finally arrives, I bend down to kiss his ring.
LEADMALE:Just then, security comes and whisks him away.
LEADFEMALE:He leaves the ring behind as a memento.
OTHERMALE:Ma, you stole the Pope's ring? It slipped off.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, for God's representative on Earth, he sure has sweaty palms.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna take it right back.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, this is a sign.
SUPMALE:Maybe I'm supposed to make a miracle.
LEADMALE:Hey, maybe this is my shot at getting into the Bible.
LEADMALE:Ma, the Bible is a done deal.
SUPMALE:Now, you can't keep it.
LEADFEMALE:We're talking about a millenniums-old symbol of the Pope's authority.
LEADFEMALE:Something so steeped in history and tradition that it makes even you seem middle-aged.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, I don't know what got into me.
LEADMALE:I'll bring it back.
SUPFEMALE:Wine! Worth a shot.
LEADMALE:Well, I finally got Miles to forgive me.
SUPMALE:He must've made me promise a million times that I would never, ever doubt him again.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, I have the detective's report here, I think we ought to read it.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Rose! Dorothy, I want to hear that report because I do trust Miles.
OTHERMALE:And it'll prove that both of you should, too.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to this.
SUPFEMALE:"9:30
LEADMALE:confirmed surgery for the following day.
LEADFEMALE:" Surgery? On what? That's all it says.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, now, honey, don't panic.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it--it may not be anything serious.
LEADMALE:Of course it's serious.
SUPFEMALE:If it was minor, he would have told me about it.
LEADFEMALE:That's why he's been living for the day.
OTHERFEMALE:He's afraid there won't be a tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:This may not be a good time, but has anyone seen a large, jewel-encrusted ring that's steeped in history just lying around lately? That's it, I'm damned.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never make it to heaven to see my Sal.
SUPFEMALE:Now, take it easy, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Let's retrace your steps.
LEADFEMALE:What did you do when you first got home? Who knows? Nap on the couch, nap on the bed, nap on the lanai.
LEADMALE:I do so much, it's all a blur.
LEADFEMALE:Then we just have to search room by room.
LEADFEMALE:It's hopeless.
SUPMALE:We'll never find it.
LEADMALE:I say we just wait and pray it turns up, say in the next day or two.
LEADMALE:What? Those are the exact words you used when my gold bracelet was missing.
OTHERFEMALE:So? So two days later you came back from the dentist saying, "Are these fillings or are these fillings?" What's your point? You didn't lose it, Ma.
LEADMALE:You just said you did so you could keep it.
SUPFEMALE:Absolutely not.
SUPFEMALE:Not in a million years.
LEADFEMALE:I swear on my life I don't have it.
LEADMALE:Do you want me to turn you upside down and shake you? You're bluffing.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Have it your way.
LEADMALE:Here! Here! I'm sorry, pussycat.
LEADMALE:It'll never happen again.
OTHERFEMALE:I really can't believe this, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:You of all people should know the value of this ring.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, please, I was just trying to buy time.
LEADMALE:I can't give up the ring until I know the Pope is gonna bless Agnes.
LEADMALE:It doesn't matter what your reasons are.
SUPMALE:Ma, this ring is important, it was wrong to take it, and I'm going to see that it gets back first thing tomorrow.
OTHERMALE:Forget it, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I'm not going.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, what's the problem? Oh, Blanche thinks I should go to the hospital tomorrow.
OTHERMALE:Well, if Miles didn't tell me about the surgery, doesn't that mean he doesn't want me there? Excuse me, Rose, you're about to make a grave mistake.
LEADMALE:You come to me if you want advice on men.
OTHERFEMALE:You go to Dorothy if there's grammar you want help with.
LEADFEMALE:You ended that sentence with a preposition just to bait me.
LEADFEMALE:What would I do that for? Look, I know how to settle this.
LEADMALE:Let me tell you a story of the steamy South.
LEADMALE:A tale of deception and tragedy.
OTHERMALE:Just a second, Uncle Remus.
SUPFEMALE:Give me the ring and I'll tell the Pope to give you a blessing, too.
SUPMALE:Ma, Blanche is telling a story.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sorry.
LEADMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:I was 19.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:He might have a blessing that gets men.
LEADFEMALE:Ma! What? I thought she was finished.
LEADMALE:She just said she was 19.
LEADFEMALE:Well, look at her now.
SUPFEMALE:You don't call that a tragedy? Ma, it is going back and that's final.
OTHERMALE:Go ahead, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:No, the mood has been ruined.
OTHERFEMALE:Suffice it to say, it involved a men's club, a vine rope, and a large bottle of Absorbine Jr.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, how could you possibly think that this would help Rose decide what to do about Miles being ill in the hospital? Oh, Blanche, God bless you.
LEADMALE:I see it all so clearly now.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care what Miles does, I'm going to be at that hospital tomorrow.
LEADMALE:And she still hasn't worn your sweatshirt.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:I called the diocese like you told me, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:The Pope will be here any minute to pick up the ring.
LEADFEMALE:The Pope's comin' here? This is horrible.
SUPFEMALE:What will I wear? I don't believe I have a thing that doesn't call attention to my bosom.
SUPFEMALE:Try not wearing makeup.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, do you actually think that the Pope makes house calls? He will this time.
LEADFEMALE:I made it crystal clear over the phone, if I don't see a Pope on the porch, they can kiss their ring goodbye.
SUPMALE:You're forgetting one thing, Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:I have the ring.
OTHERMALE:That's the one hole in my plan.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Ma, I know you're disturbed about your friend, but the Pope coming to people's houses Things like that just don't happen.
LEADMALE:That's the difference between you and me, pussycat.
LEADMALE:I believe in miracles.
SUPFEMALE: Excuse me.
OTHERFEMALE:Popes hate to be kept waiting.
LEADMALE:Good evening.
LEADMALE:I'm here about the ring.
LEADMALE:You're not the Pope.
LEADMALE:Well, not yet.
SUPMALE:But like they say, "You never know when the smoke will blow your way.
LEADMALE:" You're not getting the ring.
LEADFEMALE:Father, you'll have to excuse my mother.
LEADMALE:She has a special feeling about the ring.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, take it and go.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:I want His Holiness to visit my friend.
SUPMALE:She's in the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:She's sick and she's scared.
LEADFEMALE:And what is your friend's name, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Petrillo? No miracles, huh? Agnes O'Rourke.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure you'll understand that the Pontiff cannot make individual visits, but I can assure you a prayer will be said.
SUPMALE:A prayer? That's it? Thank you, Father.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma, I'm so sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I know how disappointed you are.
LEADMALE:But believe me, giving that ring back was the right thing to do.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm off to see Miles.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I hope he's all right.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go with you, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Agnes needs me now.
SUPMALE:Goodbye, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:If I'm not home soon, that probably means Agnes is dead.
LEADMALE:And if Agnes is dead, you killed her.
OTHERFEMALE:And if you killed her, that makes you a murderer.
LEADMALE:Enjoy, Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:Miles? Oh, my poor Miles.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Rose? Rose, is that you? Over here.
SUPMALE:Listen to my little soldier, knocking on heaven's door and still throwing his voice to make me laugh.
SUPFEMALE:No, Rose, Rose, over here.
LEADFEMALE:T-T-This bed.
LEADMALE:Miles? Mile Miles! Sweetheart, may I ask, what are you doing here? I didn't want you to see me like this.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I know.
SUPFEMALE:I just wanted a chance to say I love you.
SUPMALE:Oh, and there'll be no other man after.
SUPMALE:After? After what? I'm here for my eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank God you're not going to die.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and don't worry, I can be your eyes.
OTHERMALE:Oh, sweetheart, my eyes are fine.
LEADFEMALE:It's just the bags underneath them.
SUPFEMALE:Then I can be your bags.
LEADMALE:Rose, sweetheart, you don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:I'm I'm here for cosmetic surgery.
SUPMALE:Cosmetic surgery? Why? Because I look old, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Do you have any idea what it's like working on a college campus? Well, I've never worked on one, but I was the subject of a lab experiment once.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, you never told me that.
LEADFEMALE:They doubled my IQ.
OTHERMALE:For three days, I was another Einstein.
LEADFEMALE:Then they pulled out the IV.
OTHERFEMALE:What was in that IV? Smart juice, I guess.
SUPMALE:Oh, honey, you don't have to have your eyes done.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Rose, I know it's-- it's silly.
SUPMALE:But, you know, I'm in a youthful environment and I--I want to feel youthful.
LEADMALE:Well, if it's important to you, I'll support you.
OTHERMALE:But why didn't you tell me about it earlier? Well, for the same reason that those formulas that dye hair do it gradually.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, it's the kind of thing you want people to notice, but not to be able to pinpoint.
LEADMALE:I didn't know you dyed your hair.
LEADMALE:Rose, my hair is gray.
LEADFEMALE:It's been gray since we met.
SUPMALE:Boy, that is gradual.
LEADMALE:Oh, darling, I'm just glad you're okay.
LEADFEMALE:I have had the worst day-and-a-half and it's all because of that dumb detective.
LEADMALE:Oh, sweetheart, let's promise we'll never, ever let something like this come between us again.
LEADFEMALE:I promise.
LEADMALE:From now on, no more fighting.
LEADMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:By the way, how did you know I was here? Well, that didn't last long, did it? Hello.
SUPMALE:
SUPMALE:Hello, Sophia.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Sophia, how's Agnes? About the same.
LEADFEMALE:Is he okay? Oh, yes, he's having cosmetic surgery.
LEADMALE:It's about time.
OTHERMALE:I'll be in the john.
SUPFEMALE:Reading material.
SUPFEMALE: Oh, who could that  Oh, my, it's him! I think.
LEADFEMALE:Father.
OTHERFEMALE:Could that be who I think it is? Oh, indeed, ma'am.
SUPFEMALE:The Pontiff is stopping by to bless the patients of St.
SUPFEMALE:Ignatius on his way to the airport.
OTHERFEMALE:The Pontiff? Oh, no, no, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:Let him go.
LEADMALE:No, no, Father, I wouldn't feel right.
SUPMALE:I'm here for crow's feet.
SUPMALE:Well, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't do that.
OTHERFEMALE:Sophia, you won't believe it! You know who's here? The Pope is here! Sophia! The Pope! 
OTHERMALE:All my life I've been waiting for this! Oh, okay, I won't disturb you.
LEADFEMALE:Pussycat! Pussycat! I witnessed a miracle! The Pope came to the hospital and blessed Agnes.
LEADMALE:He answered my prayers! He answered me! Oh, ye of little faith.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you must feel special, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:You must feel blessed.
OTHERMALE:And hungry.
LEADMALE:Come on, Rose, let's go into the kitchen and whip up some loaves and fishes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he had the most beautiful blue eyes.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:All the cute guys are either married or popes.
OTHERMALE:Ace to the pair.
LEADMALE:No help for the Pontiff.
LEADMALE:Read 'em and weep.
LEADMALE:Full boat.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:High spade in the hole goes to heaven.
SUPFEMALE:So, any chance of me winning back that ring? Nah, I don't have to cut.
OTHERFEMALE:I trust you.
SUPMALE:
