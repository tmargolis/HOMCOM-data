LEADMALE:Why do these things always happen to me? I'm just a wreck.
SUPMALE:I don't know what I'm gonna do! Blanche, we go through this every morning.
LEADFEMALE:Now admit it, you have cellulite.
LEADFEMALE:I am not talking about cellulite which I don't have.
LEADMALE:I'm talking about my daughter Janet.
LEADMALE:I just got off the phone with her.
LEADFEMALE:- She's having marital troubles.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, Blanche, I'm so sorry.
OTHERMALE:But they've decided to try and work things out, so they're going to Hawaii for a second honeymoon.
LEADMALE:Sounds like they're trying to work it out.
SUPMALE:Why are you upset? Don't you listen? She has cellulite.
LEADMALE:Those are dimples.
SUPMALE:- Dimples are on these cheeks! - Ma! I am upset because while they're in Hawaii for two weeks, they're leaving my Oh, Blanche, that's wonderful news! Why, you shouldn't be upset.
LEADMALE:No, I should be upset.
SUPMALE:How am I supposed to study for my French final with a 14-year-old in the house? It's hard enough with an 80-year-old.
LEADMALE:- Are you referring to me? - Of course not, Ma.
SUPMALE:I'm referring to Cary Grant.
OTHERFEMALE:He's living in the broom closet.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, it's Blanche's grandson.
SUPFEMALE:We do for family.
LEADMALE:You're right.
OTHERMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just being selfish.
OTHERFEMALE:- It probably won't be too bad.
LEADFEMALE:- No, I suppose not.
SUPFEMALE:But whatever will we do with him for two weeks? There are plenty of things to do down here.
LEADFEMALE:We can take him to Disneyworld, the Seaquarium, the Everglades, Rambo - Rambo? - The movie with Sly Stallone.
LEADFEMALE:I sat through it twice.
SUPFEMALE:You'll love it! He sweats like a pig and he doesn't put his shirt on! It's not gonna work.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not sharing my room.
LEADMALE:Oh Ma, Ma I'm not thrilled with the arrangement either.
LEADMALE:But for the two weeks that David is here, we'll make do.
LEADMALE:Sure, it's easy for you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not the one who snores.
LEADMALE:I do not snore.
LEADMALE:Please! I'll bet less disgusting noises come out of Ernest Borgnine! I just fixed a special treat for David.
OTHERMALE:It's the same little after-school snack I used to make for my own son - a triple-decker BLT, a hearty helping of homemade potato salad, and a great big slice of double chocolate fudge cake.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, where was he going after school? The electric chair? Oh, girls! What's the matter? Where's David? I don't know where he is.
OTHERMALE:He wasn't on the plane.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I'll help you move your things back to your room.
SUPMALE:Oh, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Please! Come on, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Now calm down, calm down.
LEADMALE:He probably missed the plane.
OTHERFEMALE:It can happen to anyone.
OTHERFEMALE:- I missed a plane once.
SUPMALE:And a train - Rose, you miss a lot of things.
SUPMALE:He got on the plane all right.
LEADFEMALE:I checked with the airline.
LEADFEMALE:You probably just missed each other at the airport.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, I was standing there at the gate from the moment the first passenger got off.
OTHERFEMALE:I paged him.
SUPMALE:I checked with airport security.
LEADFEMALE:- I called the police.
LEADFEMALE:- (doorbell Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:- David! Oh, David! - Grandma! - Is this your kid? - Honey, what happened to you? It wasn't my fault, I promise.
SUPFEMALE:He stowed away in the airplane lavatory when they landed in Miami and the authorities picked him up in the duty-free shop in Freeport.
LEADMALE:- You went to the Bahamas? - I went to the bathroom! The next thing I know, I'm in the Bahamas.
LEADMALE:I figured while I was there, I'd buy some perfume for you and your friends in the duty-free shop.
LEADMALE:- David.
LEADMALE:- I'd keep an eye on this one, lady.
SUPMALE:Oh, I don't know how to thank you, officer.
LEADMALE:But I would like to try.
LEADMALE:I'm usually at Wally's for happy hour on Tuesdays.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche! - Ma'am.
LEADFEMALE:- Bye.
SUPMALE:David.
SUPMALE:I ought to give you a good talking-to, but I'm just so glad you're all right, I'm willing to overlook this little incident.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, I want you to meet my friends.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, David.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Dorothy.
SUPMALE:This is Rose.
LEADFEMALE:- Hello, David.
SUPFEMALE:- Hey, what's happening? This is Sophia.
LEADMALE:Oh, we've just been so anxious to meet you! Yeah, I'll believe that if you believe the Bahamas story.
LEADFEMALE:You know, David, I went to the Bahamas once.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? Was it on the Nina, the Pinta, or the Santa Maria? It was a DC-10.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think it had a name.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's very funny, Rose.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I'm gonna grab a bite to eat.
LEADMALE:I passed this burger joint around the corner.
SUPFEMALE:Looked like there might be some kids there.
SUPMALE:Oh, but David, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:You just got here.
OTHERMALE:- I'd really prefer you to stay.
LEADFEMALE:- I planned a special meal for you, David.
SUPMALE:- Tomorrow.
SUPMALE:I love leftovers.
LEADMALE:- Well, what time will you be back? Hard to say.
OTHERFEMALE:It depends how late the guys from Miami Vice want to party.
OTHERMALE:Later! Well, I don't believe that! But then what can I expect? His father's a Yankee.
LEADMALE:I guess I should've given him some money.
LEADMALE:- You should've given him a smack.
LEADFEMALE:- Ma.
OTHERMALE:I don't believe in hitting children.
LEADMALE:Personally, I like to lay into a kid with a melon baller.
SUPMALE:It's got a nice weight, good balance in the hand.
SUPMALE:And it's portable.
LEADFEMALE:My father used to punish us by sending us to the dairy barn to milk Alice.
SUPMALE:- Well, what's so terrible about that? - You had to milk Alice sitting on a stool.
SUPMALE:I thought you always milked a cow sitting on a stool.
LEADMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:Alice had to sit on a stool.
LEADMALE:You see, she was involved in this nasty plowing accident.
LEADMALE:It was during spring planting and Daddy had hitched her up to the plow 'cause poor old Toby had gotten a fever and gone deaf Rose, Rose, Rose Sweetheart, save the story.
LEADMALE:When David comes back, tell him.
LEADFEMALE:That can be his punishment.
LEADFEMALE:- Ma, what are you doing? - Living.
LEADFEMALE:Pardonnez-moi.
LEADMALE:- I just can't study with the noise! - Fine, I'll stop breathing.
LEADMALE:Look, I haven't studied since David arrived.
SUPFEMALE:My test is My test is in two weeks and I do not want to blow it.
OTHERMALE:- You'll pass.
LEADFEMALE:- I don't want to pass.
LEADFEMALE:I want an A.
SUPMALE:You're the same as you were in grade school - A's.
OTHERFEMALE:You always had to get an A.
LEADFEMALE:You're brother thought a book was to sit on.
SUPFEMALE:You always had to get an A.
OTHERMALE:- Good night.
LEADFEMALE:- Good night, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:If I breathe and it bothers you, put a pillow over my face.
SUPFEMALE:How could I sleep with that racket? - What racket? - Your pencil.
LEADMALE:- My pencil? - You're pressing too hard.
LEADMALE:It's making me crazy! I give up.
SUPMALE:- Look at me.
SUPMALE:- What? - You're getting a cold.
OTHERMALE:- No, I'm not.
OTHERMALE:Yes, you are.
SUPMALE:Tomorrow, you'll have a cold.
LEADFEMALE:What is this? The curse of the catwoman? - I'm a mother, I know these things.
LEADMALE:- Good night, Ma.
LEADMALE:Good night.
OTHERFEMALE:What's that smell? I don't smell anything.
LEADMALE:Are you wearing something? A little Ben Gay on my knees.
LEADFEMALE:A little Vicks on my chest.
LEADMALE:A little Deep Heat on my neck.
LEADFEMALE:What are you trying to do, pickle yourself so you'll live to be 100? Fine, I'll wipe it off.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow, I'll be in a wheelchair.
LEADFEMALE:- Goodnight, Ma.
LEADMALE:- Goodnight.
SUPFEMALE:Keep it up, I'll need a Dramamine.
LEADMALE:I'm trying to get comfortable.
LEADFEMALE:Not me.
SUPFEMALE:You get too comfortable, you don't wake up! - Goodnight, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:- Goodnight.
LEADFEMALE:(snorting and clearing throat - Ma.
OTHERMALE:- What? That noise.
OTHERMALE:What noise? The noise you're making with your nose and throat.
OTHERMALE:I got a postnasal drip.
OTHERFEMALE:What would you like me to do, drown in phlegm? - Good night, Ma.
LEADMALE:- Good night.
LEADMALE:You know, we haven't slept together since I was a little girl.
SUPMALE:Thank God.
SUPMALE:I used to get into your bed whenever I had that dream about the bear.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:The bear dream.
LEADFEMALE:- I hated that dream.
SUPFEMALE:A bear is eating you.
SUPMALE:What's to love? You were so cute.
OTHERMALE:You were always so polite when you woke me.
OTHERFEMALE:"Mommy, I'm having a bad dream.
LEADFEMALE:Could I come in?" I felt so safe with you.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, I felt safe with you when you were three.
LEADFEMALE:And you always used to smell from Midnight in Paris perfume.
SUPMALE:Better than this, huh? - It sure was nice.
LEADMALE:- It still is.
LEADFEMALE:- Good night, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:- Good night, pussycat.
LEADMALE:What in the world is going on here? David, I said, what in the world is going on here? I thought you were in bed! I couldn't sleep, so I went out and got a pizza.
OTHERFEMALE:Made a few friends and we decided to have a party.
LEADFEMALE:David, this is an inconvenience.
SUPMALE:I mean, it is 2:00 in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:Now please, ask your fr friends to leave.
LEADMALE:Come on, girls.
LEADMALE:Relax, loosen up! Hey, life's too short.
OTHERMALE:Especially for you guys.
LEADFEMALE:- David! - I'll get the melon baller.
LEADFEMALE:Take it easy, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:Don't get your support hose in a knot.
LEADMALE:That does it! The party is over! Everybody out, out! Not you.
OTHERFEMALE:Out! It's really been lovely.
LEADMALE:And if anything is missing, I will give your names to every narc in this city.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! David, clean up this mess, then go to bed.
LEADMALE:Hey, why don't you clean up the mess yourself? What's the big deal? We were just having some fun.
LEADFEMALE:You know that those happen to be my friends you just threw out? You know, this really stinks.
SUPFEMALE:What am I supposed to do for the next two weeks, just sit around and listen to your arteries harden? You stop that! You know something? I am having a real problem with your attitude! Oh, really? Well, you can all just kiss my attitude! Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you wouldn't let me get the melon baller, so I improvised.
LEADFEMALE:Is that all you Italians know how to do, scream and hit? No, we also know how to make love and sing opera.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, you had no right to hit him.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, I'm so sorry.
OTHERMALE:She should not have done that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I have to go talk to David.
LEADFEMALE:I feel just awful about this.
LEADMALE:This is like The Long Day's Journey Into Light.
LEADFEMALE:Night.
SUPMALE:Rose.
LEADMALE:Night, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:David, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine.
LEADMALE:It's just that nobody ever hit me before.
LEADFEMALE:I think I should go home.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you can't go home.
LEADMALE:There's nobody there to take care of you.
LEADMALE:That's OK.
LEADFEMALE:I'd rather be there alone than trapped here with you.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, I can take care of myself.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been doing it long enough.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean? All Mom and Dad ever do is fight.
LEADFEMALE:They don't even know I exist.
LEADFEMALE:Have you tried telling them how you feel? - They wouldn't listen.
SUPFEMALE:- I'm listening.
SUPFEMALE:Only because they dumped me on you and you feel you have to.
OTHERMALE:- No, David.
LEADFEMALE:- You don't have to! Just leave me alone! "Trim the hedges, mow the lawn, paint the patio furniture, wash the windows, clean out the garage, scrub the denture cup.
LEADFEMALE:" I added that.
OTHERMALE:I hate doing it.
LEADMALE:This is too much.
LEADMALE:I can't ask him to do this.
LEADMALE:- Of course you can.
OTHERFEMALE:- Idle hands are the devil's workshop.
SUPMALE:God, I wish I'd said that.
OTHERMALE:I don't see how doing all these chores is gonna make him feel loved.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Blanche, the one thing that David has never had in his life is structure.
SUPFEMALE:Doing chores will give him a little responsibility.
LEADMALE:He might even start feeling good about himself.
LEADFEMALE:And start hating me if I ask him to do all this! Listen, Blanche, you do what is best for David, not what is easiest for you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we had chores on the farm.
LEADMALE:Boys and girls.
LEADFEMALE:When we finished, we had such a feeling of accomplishment.
LEADMALE:We had to feed the chickens, slop the hogs, muck the stalls.
LEADMALE:Please, I'm trying to eat here! And after I finished all that, I still had to take care of Larry, my one-eyed pig.
LEADFEMALE:What did you people do, run a farm for handicapped animals? But you grew up in the country.
LEADMALE:David's a city boy.
LEADMALE:Oh, wait now, Blanche, come on.
LEADFEMALE:I'm from New York.
SUPFEMALE:I did chores.
LEADMALE:I made the beds, I washed the dishes, scoured the pots, cleaned the bathroom, folded the laundry, took out the garbage.
LEADMALE:My, my.
SUPFEMALE:Did you attend a military school? No, she lived with me.
SUPFEMALE:- Did they have chores in Sicily? - Are you kidding? They invented chores in Sicily.
LEADMALE:Crossing the street without getting pregnant was a chore in Sicily.
SUPFEMALE:- Rose, never mention Sicily.
OTHERMALE:- Oh I guess when I was little, I didn't have to do anything.
SUPFEMALE:And I raised my daughter the same way.
LEADFEMALE:So that's why David is the way he is now.
LEADMALE:So it's all my fault! Oh, now, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:You can't blame yourself for David.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:It's my mother's fault.
LEADMALE:I am gonna give this list to David and see that he starts right away.
LEADMALE:How is it possible to get pregnant in Sicily just by crossing the street? - Cheap Chianti and narrow streets.
LEADMALE:- Oh If you wait a couple of minutes, I'll make you some sandwiches.
LEADFEMALE:- Where you going? - I don't know.
LEADMALE:How you getting there? - I'll take a bus.
SUPFEMALE:- I see.
OTHERFEMALE:And when the bus gets to you-don't-know-where, - what will you do then? - Get a job.
SUPFEMALE:- Really? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:As what, Secretary of State? - I gotta go.
LEADMALE:- So you're just gonna wimp out, huh? - I'm not wimping out.
LEADFEMALE:- What do you call this? Why should I stay here when I got all this crappy stuff to do? And no one likes me anyway.
LEADFEMALE:You know, first of all, buddy boy, life is full of crappy stuff to do.
LEADMALE:It's everywhere, so you better get used to it.
SUPMALE:The President has crappy stuff to do.
SUPMALE:Second of all, your grandmother happens to like you.
LEADMALE:My mother likes you.
SUPMALE:She doesn't hit anyone unless she really cares.
LEADFEMALE:Take it from me.
SUPMALE:And I happen to like you.
SUPFEMALE:- My life stinks.
LEADFEMALE:- I know.
LEADMALE:Things are tough at home and that really does stink.
LEADMALE:But you have a choice.
LEADMALE:You can tough it out or you can let it beat you.
OTHERFEMALE:But right now you're here, and this doesn't have to stink.
OTHERFEMALE:And if you stay and work at it and everything turns out, you'll have a place to visit when the things at home really get to stink.
LEADFEMALE:- I just can't, like, come here whenever.
LEADMALE:- You can just, like, come here whenever.
SUPMALE:Well, I don't mind the gardening.
LEADFEMALE:But it's, like, the vacuuming I hate.
LEADMALE:- That's, like, for girls.
LEADMALE:- Well, we can renegotiate.
LEADMALE:I'll do the vacuuming if you'II, like, learn English.
OTHERMALE:Come on, I'll fix you something to eat.
LEADFEMALE:All right, now, attention, everyone.
LEADFEMALE:I want to propose a toast.
LEADMALE:To Dorothy Zbornak, who got an A in her French class, proving that you can teach an old dog new tricks.
LEADMALE:- And if anyone knows about tricks - Ma! Thank you, ladies and gentleman.
SUPMALE:Or should I say, merci beaucoup.
LEADMALE:mes amies.
LEADMALE:Oh, my, that was impressive! Jane Goodall once taught an ape to rhumba - that's impressive! Now, I would like to propose a toast.
SUPFEMALE:To David, who in the past week has proven that he is one damn good kid.
LEADFEMALE:Hear, hear.
SUPMALE:You know, it's really been interesting.
LEADFEMALE:I got hit, did chores, learned all about handicapped animals.
LEADFEMALE:All in all, it hasn't been half-bad.
LEADFEMALE:And if it's all right with you, I wouldn't mind living here full-time.
LEADFEMALE:I would certainly have to discuss that with your parents.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mom and Dad will say yes.
SUPFEMALE:They'll be as happy with the idea as I am.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm gonna get some ice cream.
LEADMALE:Wait up! I'll show you where I hide the good stuff.
LEADMALE:Call his mother! - Blanche, what are we gonna do? - Do you think I should call his mother? - I really think you should.
OTHERMALE:- All right, I will.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to send him back to an unhappy home, but we're grandmothers.
SUPFEMALE:It wouldn't be fair to be this old and have to raise children.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, baby, it's Mama! Well, I'm fine, honey, I'm just fine.
LEADMALE:I'm calling you about David.
LEADMALE:No, he's fine.
LEADMALE:Matter of fact, he's so happy here, Janet, that I've decided to keep him and raise him myself.
OTHERFEMALE:You heard me.
LEADMALE:He says that you and Michael spend so much time arguing, that you don't have time for him.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you take that tone with me, missy.
LEADMALE:Yes, I realize you're his mother No, I don't suppose I can stop you if you insist on coming and getting him.
SUPFEMALE:But you let me tell you this.
OTHERMALE:If you and Michael don't straighten up and give that boy the love and attention he deserves, I will kick your uppity butt till hell won't have it again! She'll call us right back.
SUPMALE:She has to wake up the Yankee.
LEADFEMALE:- Well done, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, absolutely.
LEADMALE:Nice bluff.
LEADMALE:That was no bluff.
OTHERMALE:I meant every word of it.
LEADMALE:I would love to have a chance to raise David.
SUPMALE:I might make up for the mess I made with Janet.
SUPFEMALE:I still wish you'd let us drive you to the airport.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my cab's already here.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, I've seen the way you all drive.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! I'm gonna miss you guys.
OTHERFEMALE:It was nice of your folks to let you join them in Hawaii.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, they've never ignored me on an island before.
LEADMALE:David, you listen to me.
LEADFEMALE:They want the three of you to start over from scratch, so the least you can do is meet them halfway.
LEADFEMALE:- I'll try.
LEADMALE:- I bet it'll be easier than you think.
LEADMALE:Especially now that you have an alternative.
SUPFEMALE:If things get too tough at home, you can always come here and live with us.
LEADFEMALE:- Well - Bye, Grandma.
LEADMALE:Bye, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:- Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:- Bye, love.
LEADFEMALE:Rose.
SUPMALE:See ya, slugger.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, darling.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
OTHERFEMALE:Run, run, run! Go.
LEADMALE:Oh, I hope he's gonna be all right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy that was so sweet of you, telling him he could come live with us.
SUPMALE:I meant it! It's gonna be awfully quiet around here without him.
SUPFEMALE:I'll say.
LEADFEMALE:No more listening to Dorothy snore! Ma, I do not snore! Please, I had to turn you from the window so you wouldn't inhale the drapes! 
LEADMALE:
