LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute! Just where do you think you're going? Over to Mildred's to watch the adult movie channel.
LEADMALE:She has a wide-screen TV.
LEADMALE:You are not going anywhere.
SUPMALE:Dr.
LEADMALE:Clayton is coming.
SUPMALE:- Dr.
LEADMALE:Silvano is my doctor! - Dr.
LEADMALE:Silvano is dead.
SUPFEMALE:Trust me, I'm in better shape than he is.
LEADMALE:Goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you have to have an examination.
OTHERMALE:Your blood pressure is up, you're tired, you have absolutely no color.
OTHERMALE:I'm an old white woman.
LEADMALE:I'm not supposed to have color.
LEADFEMALE:You want color? Talk to Lena Horne.
SUPFEMALE:Here we are, Sophia.
SUPMALE:Homemade chicken soup.
LEADMALE:I used to make it for my husband when he wasn't feeling well.
LEADFEMALE:Did you make it for him the last time he wasn't feeling well? - Hello, everyone.
OTHERMALE:- Hi, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I just happened upon the most divine dress sale.
LEADMALE:I would'have called you girls, but all they had left were petites.
LEADMALE:So what did you buy? Shoes? I'm a petite.
LEADMALE:I'd better go there.
LEADMALE:I need a black dress for Dr.
OTHERMALE:Silvano's funeral.
SUPMALE:Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Silvano died two months ago.
LEADMALE:You went to his funeral.
LEADFEMALE:Right, I can't let him see me in the same dress.
LEADMALE:Ma, you're not going anywhere until the doctor comes! You can't go anywhere now.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to see how good I look in my new dress! You know something? We're really lucky we found a doctor who makes house calls.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:When I was growing up in Minnesota, the doctor made house calls all the time for us and the livestock.
LEADMALE:You and the animals had the same doctor? Sure.
SUPMALE:Worked out fine until the doctor started drinking hog liniment and tried to neuter the Swensen brothers.
LEADFEMALE:(doorbell If that's the doctor, tell him I have no insurance and no money! If he still wants to come in, he just wants to see me naked.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, I'm Dr.
LEADMALE:Clayton.
LEADFEMALE:I'm here to see Sophia Petrillo.
OTHERMALE:Oh please, please come right in.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Dorothy, Sophia's daughter, and I usually look much better.
LEADMALE:Now, this is my friend, Rose.
SUPMALE:- Hello, doctor.
LEADFEMALE:- Rose.
SUPFEMALE:And this is Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:- What seems to be her problem? - Her blood pressure is up and she's a little pale and a little tired.
SUPMALE:- She on any medication? - Yes, to control blood pressure.
LEADFEMALE:- How long's she been on that medication? - What am I, two years old? I don't know my own symptoms? I've lived in this body since I was born.
OTHERMALE:If something goes wrong, I'm the first one to hear about it! I'm sorry, Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:What seems to be the problem? What am I, a doctor? Why don't we start by taking your temperature, huh? Temperature, hmm.
SUPMALE:He must have graduated at the top of his class.
OTHERMALE:- Under your tongue.
LEADFEMALE:- Uh, tell me, - are you new to this area, Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Clayton? - Yes.
LEADMALE:I recently moved here.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Miami's a beautiful city.
LEADMALE:I'm sure you'll enjoy living here.
LEADMALE:Yes, and I'm sure your wife, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Clayton, will enjoy it, too.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Clayton and I are no longer together.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I'm so sorry.
LEADMALE:So, tell me, have you had a chance - to see much of the city? - No, not really.
LEADFEMALE:Perhaps I could show you some of the highlights sometime.
LEADFEMALE:That sounds great.
SUPMALE:I'd love it! I'd love to go, too.
SUPFEMALE:Except I have to wash my hair every day for the rest of my life.
SUPFEMALE:It's very oily.
LEADFEMALE:What about dinner tomorrow night, Dorothy? Say, about eight? Perfect! We'll go to Jack's Crab House.
LEADFEMALE:It's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Well, girls, is this dress gonna stop traffic or what? Oh, hello there.
LEADMALE:I don't believe we've been introduced.
SUPFEMALE:My name is Blanche Deveraux.
LEADMALE:That's French for "Blanche Deveraux.
LEADMALE:" - I'm pleased to meet you.
SUPMALE:- Forgive me for staring, but I do declare, you're just about the most attractive man I've seen in Florida since Mr.
LEADMALE:John Forsythe performed Hamlet at the Burt Reynolds Dinner Theatre.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, might I see you a moment? Pardonnez-moi.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, you keep your bloomers on, Scarlett.
LEADMALE:He's taking me out tomorrow night.
OTHERMALE:But he wants me.
SUPMALE:I can feel it.
SUPFEMALE:Let somebody else feel it.
OTHERFEMALE:- I saw him first.
LEADMALE:- But we were meant for each other.
LEADFEMALE:- I'm a woman, he's a man.
OTHERFEMALE:- And what am I, Little Richard? Oh, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Fair's fair.
LEADMALE:But if he has a friend who makes house calls, I can be ill any night this week except Thursday.
OTHERFEMALE:- Well, doctor, how is she? - Her temperature seems to be normal.
LEADMALE:Tell me, Sophia, are you taking your medication as directed? I take my medication every day, if I remember.
LEADMALE:You have to remember to take it every day.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I'll see that she does, Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Clayton.
LEADFEMALE:Elliot.
LEADMALE:Well, ladies, it's been a great pleasure meeting you.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, it's been especially nice meeting you.
LEADMALE:I'm sure she's all right, but you call me if you need me, and I'll see you tomorrow night.
LEADMALE:- Goodbye, Elliot.
OTHERFEMALE:- Goodbye, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank you for being a kind and generous god.
LEADFEMALE:OK, what do you think of this one? Dorothy, you and Elliot have been out almost every night this week.
LEADFEMALE:He's obviously hooked.
LEADMALE:You don't have to look good anymore.
LEADFEMALE:What you have on is fine.
SUPFEMALE:- I'll change.
LEADMALE:- Come on.
SUPFEMALE:I'll help you pick out something.
LEADMALE:There's nothing left to pick.
LEADMALE:The only thing I haven't tried on is the bedspread.
SUPMALE:(doorbell - Oh, hello, Elliot.
LEADFEMALE:Come in.
SUPFEMALE:- Hello, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Dorothy ready? I'm afraid she's gonna be a little while.
SUPMALE:May I offer you a drink? Why, sure, if you'll join me.
SUPFEMALE:I don't mind if I do.
SUPFEMALE:What would you like? Something smooth and sweet with a little kick to it.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
OTHERFEMALE:How about a Sloe Gin Fizz? You're talking about the drink and I'm talking about the bartender.
SUPMALE:- Oh.
LEADMALE:- Blanche, you feel all right? - You feel a little flushed.
LEADMALE:- I do? Yeah, let me check your pulse.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, it's racing.
LEADMALE:You know what? So is mine.
LEADMALE:I beg your pardon? - You're a very attractive woman, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:- I know.
SUPMALE:Very very attractive.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:What are you doing? How dare you? - What kind of woman do you think I am? - Relax.
OTHERFEMALE:Relax? Don't you tell me to relax! I am not accustomed to being manhandled.
LEADMALE:- I thought you'd be flattered.
OTHERMALE:- Well, I'm not.
LEADMALE:Pardon my strong language, but you, sir, are no gentleman.
OTHERFEMALE:- I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:- You ought to be.
LEADFEMALE:What about Dorothy? - She happens to be my friend.
SUPMALE:- No reason to bring Dorothy into this.
SUPMALE:- Hmm.
OTHERMALE:- Hi, Elliot.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:My, what is that marvelous scent you're wearing? Fancy albacore tuna.
SUPMALE:I made a casserole for dinner.
LEADMALE:Well, you certainly wear it well.
OTHERMALE:I think it's the pimento that really sets it off.
LEADMALE:- Hello, Elliot.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry I'm late.
LEADMALE:- It's all right, but we should be going.
SUPMALE:If I'm not back by Christmas, someone take my mother to midnight mass.
OTHERMALE:There is something about that man I don't trust.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't put my finger on it.
OTHERFEMALE:I can.
SUPMALE:He's a letch.
LEADMALE:No, that isn't it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes it is, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:He made a pass at me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my Lord! That's terrible! Dorothy'll be heartbroken when you tell her.
LEADMALE:- I'm not telling her anything.
SUPFEMALE:- She's your friend.
LEADMALE:- You've got to tell her! - Oh, no, I don't.
LEADMALE:The last time a friend's sweetheart made a pass at me, I lost my friend and her beau.
OTHERMALE:- And her beau? - That's right.
LEADMALE:Anderbeau Johnson.
LEADMALE:Clyde Whitehead, Anderbeau's beau, decided he wanted to see my cheerleader's sweater from the inside.
LEADMALE:So when I told Anderbeau, she blamed the whole thing on me, and then Clyde would never speak to me again for telling! I lost Anderbeau and her beau! Now you understand why I can't tell Dorothy? I don't even understand who Anderbobo is.
LEADFEMALE:All I know is that Dorothy should find out what kind of a man Elliot really is.
LEADMALE:Now, if you're her friend, you'll tell her.
SUPMALE:But honey, she'd be devastated! What kind of a friend would I be to hurt her? What kind of a friend would you be if you let Elliot ruin her life? She could marry that man! They could have a child! They could adopt a child! And then one night at the country club, possibly during little Mei-Ling's coming-out party Dorothy's having the time of her life when she goes to the powder room and she overhears the towel lady telling Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Steinbeck that Dorothy's husband, Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Elliot Clayton, has bonged every female member of the country club.
LEADMALE:Can you let that happen to Dorothy? Can you let that happen to little Mei-Ling? Hasn't she suffered enough? Not as much as I have listening to that story.
LEADFEMALE:Oh forget the story.
LEADMALE:You have to tell Dorothy.
LEADMALE:She's your friend! You're right.
OTHERMALE:She is my best friend.
SUPMALE:- I thought I was your best friend.
SUPMALE:- You were till you told me that story.
OTHERMALE:- Thank you.
OTHERMALE:- Good night, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, Elliot.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:I thought you'd never come home.
LEADFEMALE:I have to talk to you.
OTHERFEMALE:- Is something wrong? Is it Ma? - Oh, no, she's fine.
LEADMALE:It's just that you're out so late on a school night.
LEADFEMALE:- What? - I mean, how was your date with Elliot? Wonderful, as usual.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, I have to tell you something.
SUPFEMALE:It's just so hard.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know how to tell you, except, I guess, just straight out.
LEADMALE:What? Well Elliot made Elliot made What? Elliot made a What? What did Elliot make, a ship in a bottle? What? Elliot made a pass at me.
LEADMALE:Elliot made a pass at you? You mean, he winked at you.
LEADMALE:He winks at everyone.
LEADFEMALE:He's a very big winker.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:It was more than a wink.
LEADMALE:He came up to me, and he put his big, masculine arms around my tiny little waist.
LEADFEMALE:- I don't believe you.
LEADFEMALE:- What? I don't believe that he put his big, masculine arms around your alleged tiny little waist.
LEADMALE:Why would I make up such a thing? - Because you're jealous.
LEADFEMALE:- Jealous? You're used to getting all the attention, and someone comes along and wants me and not you and it is eating your guts out.
LEADFEMALE:- Eating my guts out? - You know something? You could never be a real friend to another woman, and you know why? - Why? - Because you're a slut! - A slut?! - Don't repeat everything I say.
LEADMALE:Don't repeat everything you say? I'm not! - You just did.
LEADMALE:- Nothing you say's worth repeatin'.
LEADFEMALE:You, Blanche, are an amoral, backstabbing, self-centered Jezebel, and I am very glad that this happened because now I know really what kind of person you are.
OTHERMALE:The hell with you and your oversexed boyfriend, Dorothy Zbornak! I'm just glad that little Mei-Ling's coming-out party was ruined.
LEADMALE:Who? And I'm glad that Elliot is bonging every woman at your country club! What the hell are you talking about? Ask the towel lady! Morning, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Can I get you some coffee? "Dorothy deserves to know what kind of a person Elliot really is.
LEADMALE:If you're her friend, you'll tell her.
LEADFEMALE:" Thanks for the advice, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:Now Dorothy's not speaking to me, and I'm not speaking to you.
OTHERMALE:Now you can get me that coffee.
LEADMALE:I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but you did the right thing by telling Dorothy about Elliot.
SUPMALE:- What about Elliot? - He made a pass at me.
SUPMALE:- While he's seeing my Dorothy? - Yes.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it! My daughter is finally dating a doctor he turns out to be a scuzz bucket! Why does everything happen to me? - Dorothy hates me.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, Blanche, that's not true! Oh, yes it is, and I hate her right back double.
LEADFEMALE:Now get me some cream.
SUPFEMALE:Morning, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche and I were just having some coffee.
OTHERFEMALE:- Would you care to join us? - Frankly, Rose, I would rather use Willie Nelson's hairbrush.
OTHERFEMALE:Must you attack everything Southern? Come on, now, girls.
LEADFEMALE:This is no way to behave.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't there some way we can settle this like rational adults? We can, once Dorothy stops acting like a child.
LEADMALE:I am acting like a child? Do you know what your problem is? - (doorbell - That's Elliot.
LEADMALE:I have to leave.
OTHERFEMALE:How dare you leave in the middle of a fight? You come back here! I have a few things I want to say to you, missy! All right, girls, now hold it right there, and I'm not fooling around! Dorothy, I think you have to confront Elliot with Blanche's accusation.
LEADMALE:Absolutely not! Now, I have to go.
OTHERFEMALE:Morning, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Ready to go? Not quite.
SUPMALE:Elliot, Blanche says that you made a pass at her.
OTHERFEMALE:- What? - You heard her.
SUPFEMALE:- I don't know what to say.
SUPFEMALE:- You sure knew what to say last night Elliot, did you make a pass at Blanche or not? - Absolutely not.
LEADFEMALE:- He's lying.
LEADFEMALE:Look at him, he's twitching and blinking.
SUPFEMALE:He's lying and twitching and blinking.
LEADFEMALE:He is blinking, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Maybe I had better wait for you in the car.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, you just have to believe me.
SUPFEMALE:It's not enough that you have had half the men in Dade County.
LEADMALE:You have to have everyone else's men.
SUPMALE:It is pathetic.
OTHERFEMALE:I have just never felt so betrayed in all my life.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't been a good friend to a lot of people, but I have been a very good friend to you, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:And you take some stranger's word over mine? I'm not gonna stand for this, not in my own house.
OTHERFEMALE:I want you out of here.
LEADMALE:Blanche, you don't mean that.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't mean it.
LEADFEMALE:- I do so mean it.
LEADMALE:- I'll be out as soon as I can find a place.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, you can't just throw Dorothy out on the street! You just watch me.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter, Sophia? You couldn't sleep, either? No, I was sleeping great, Rose.
LEADMALE:I just wanted to show off my pajamas.
LEADMALE:I'm upset about Dorothy and Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, me, too.
SUPMALE:Who'd believe that they'd break up their friendship over a man? - It happens.
LEADFEMALE:- What can we do? - Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Just stay out of it.
SUPFEMALE:- I can't do that.
SUPFEMALE:Let me tell you a story.
SUPFEMALE:Sicily, 1912.
LEADMALE:Picture 
LEADMALE:Two young girls, best friends, who shared three things a pizza recipe, some dough, and a dream.
SUPMALE:Everything is going great until one day, a fast-talking pepperoni salesman gallops into town.
SUPMALE:Of course, both girls are impressed.
SUPFEMALE:He dates one one night, the other, the next night.
LEADMALE:Pretty soon, he drives a wedge between them.
LEADMALE:Before you know it, the pizza suffers, the business suffers, the friendship suffers.
LEADMALE:The girls part company and head for America, never to see one another again.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, one of those girls was me.
LEADFEMALE:The other one you probably know as Mama Celeste.
LEADMALE:Sophia, what's the point? The point is, I lost a fortune! What does that have to do with getting Dorothy and Blanche back together? Nothing! I told you, stay out of it! I can't! I can't just stand by and watch this happen.
OTHERFEMALE:I've got to do something.
LEADFEMALE:That might work, too.
LEADMALE:Abbondanzal Rose, honey, can I borrow your golf gloves? I already packed mine.
LEADFEMALE:- Only if you promise not to move out.
LEADMALE:- I cannot promise that! Then putt with bare hands! (doorbell - Hi.
LEADMALE:Ready to go? - Soon as Rose lends me some gloves.
LEADMALE:They're in the bottom drawer on the left, under my clarinet.
LEADMALE:Be right back.
SUPFEMALE:Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Jerry Vale? - No.
SUPFEMALE:- They should.
LEADFEMALE:He's the only man in the world that can make the hair on my arms stand up.
SUPMALE:Can I fix you a drink? No, thanks.
LEADMALE:Is something wrong with your leg? Nothing you can't fix, doctor man.
SUPMALE:- I beg your pardon? - I know I look square, but I'm like my father's tractor.
SUPMALE:I take awhile to warm up, but once I get going, I can turn your topsoil 'til the cows come home.
OTHERMALE:Rose, please.
LEADFEMALE:Wanna see some Polaroids of me in my tennis skirt? Look, Rose, I'm flattered, and please, no offense, but you're just not my type.
SUPMALE:- But Blanche was.
LEADMALE:- That never happened.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes it did.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche told me all about it.
SUPFEMALE:- She made it up.
LEADFEMALE:- I don't think so.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, nothing came of it.
LEADMALE:I did apologize to her.
LEADMALE:- And you lied to me.
LEADFEMALE:- Dorothy! You lied to me about Blanche! Dorothy, sweetheart, please try to understand.
SUPMALE:It was no big deal.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you think so? I probably lost one of my best friends because of you.
SUPMALE:To me, that's a very big deal.
LEADMALE:- I take it we're not playing golf.
OTHERMALE:- We're not playing anything anymore.
SUPFEMALE:I'll call you in a few days when you've cooled down.
LEADFEMALE:Don't bother.
LEADMALE:I really have nothing to say to you.
SUPMALE:- I'm so sorry, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:- No, I'm the one who's sorry.
LEADMALE:I have to go talk to Blanche.
LEADMALE:I've been an idiot through this whole thing! Darn right you have! - (knock on door - Come in.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's you.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Blanche, we have to talk.
SUPMALE:I don't have anything to say to you, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Then let me do the talking.
SUPFEMALE:Elliot was just here and he told me the truth about what happened.
LEADMALE:Well, I hate to say "I told you so," but I did.
LEADMALE:I told you so! Honey, I'm sorry for not believing you.
SUPFEMALE:- There's no excuse for my behavior.
LEADFEMALE:- There most certainly isn't.
LEADMALE:I guess when it came down to it, I didn't believe you because I didn't want to.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody ever believes me when I'm telling the truth.
SUPFEMALE:I guess it's the curse of being a devastatingly beautiful woman.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, please! The only other woman who could possibly understand is Priscilla Presley and Susan Anton.
LEADFEMALE:No, not Susan Anton.
SUPFEMALE:Even my husband didn't believe me on our wedding night - when I told him he was the first.
LEADMALE:- But George wasn't your first.
LEADMALE:Well, he didn't know that! The point is, he didn't believe me.
LEADMALE:Look, Blanche Blanche, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think you can ever forgive me? I don't know.
SUPMALE:I have to think about it.
SUPMALE:I understand.
OTHERFEMALE:OK, I've thought about it.
LEADFEMALE:I forgive you! Oh, Blanche, Blanche, thank you! Oh, what the heck! That's what friendship's all about.
SUPMALE:Oh, Blanche, Dorothy! Oh, I'm so glad you made up.
OTHERMALE:- I knew you couldn't stay mad for long.
LEADFEMALE:- Of course we couldn't.
OTHERMALE:Oh, it takes a big woman to forgive somebody calling her a slut! You! Fight over? Good.
SUPFEMALE:Here, taste these.
LEADFEMALE:I'm conducting a pizza challenge.
SUPFEMALE:One of these is mine, one is Mama you-know-who's.
LEADMALE:Taste them and tell me which you like better.
SUPMALE:If I'm right, this could be worth millions.
SUPFEMALE:My face could be in every freezer in America.
LEADMALE:Mmm.
LEADMALE:A, definitely.
LEADMALE:- Mmm.
LEADFEMALE:Yep, A.
SUPMALE:- Yeah, A.
SUPFEMALE:A, without a doubt.
LEADMALE:You can't pick men and you can't pick pizza! 
LEADFEMALE:
