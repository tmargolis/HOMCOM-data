LEADFEMALE:Hi, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:What you cooking? Lasagna, for a guy at the center.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Is he cute? Cute.
LEADMALE:He's 84, doesn't have a hair on his head or a real tooth in his mouth, and his body's covered with liver spots.
LEADFEMALE:To answer your question, he's adorable.
LEADFEMALE:Look at the great costume I got for the masquerade ball.
SUPMALE:I can't decide whether to be the front end or the rear end.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in a romantic mood.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna let that golden opportunity pass right by.
SUPMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Oh, hello.
LEADFEMALE:I got our costume for the ball at the counseling center.
OTHERMALE:Is it time for that again? It's the biggest social event of the season.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, it'll be fun.
LEADMALE:It will not be fun.
SUPMALE:There is no fun in my life.
LEADFEMALE:Have you ever felt like you're stuck in a rut, going through the motions with no joy, pleasure or excitement? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:That was my sex life with your father.
LEADMALE:Ma, my job is routine.
OTHERMALE:I have virtually no social life.
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing interests me.
SUPMALE:My life has just become dull and boring.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's that sense of fun, that lighthearted laughter, that devil-may-care attitude? Sophia, when was Dorothy ever like that? Never.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been asking her these questions since she's 12.
LEADMALE:You can't help it if you're dull and boring.
SUPFEMALE:God did that to give the world some variety.
LEADMALE:Otherwise, everybody would be just like me.
LEADMALE:And there wouldn't be enough sailors to go around.
OTHERFEMALE:Your life doesn't have to be dull.
LEADFEMALE:It's up to you to make it interesting.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:Get off your duff and do something.
LEADFEMALE:There's a lecture at the school tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Barbara Thorndyke is going to speak.
SUPMALE:Who's Barbara Thorndyke? A local novelist whose stories are all set in Florida.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a second.
SUPFEMALE:Barbara Thorndyke.
LEADMALE:Didn't she write Evil Wind Over Pensacola?
LEADMALE:You know it?
SUPMALE:I go to bed with it every night.
SUPFEMALE:What's it about?
LEADFEMALE:How should I know? My mattress frame lost a caster.
SUPFEMALE:I use it to keep the bed level.
SUPMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Are we expecting company? Yep.
SUPFEMALE:Barbara Thorndyke.
LEADFEMALE:I introduced myself after the lecture.
OTHERFEMALE:We went out and had coffee and talked for hours.
LEADFEMALE:What you talk about? Art, literature, world events, life.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't had that stimulating a conversation in years.
LEADMALE:If you're saying you can't get stimulating conversation around this house, I beg to differ.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe it.
OTHERMALE:It says since Michael Jackson can't buy the Elephant Man, he's put in a bid for the remains of the Big Bopper.
SUPFEMALE:You can't believe everything you read in that rag.
LEADFEMALE:It caters to people of the lowest intelligence.
LEADMALE:Then why do you buy it? Because it's the only newspaper Elvis will talk to from beyond the grave.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:Where was I?
LEADFEMALE:It's not important.
SUPMALE:Listen, Rose.
OTHERMALE:Let's put this away so that Barbara Thorndyke won't see it.
LEADMALE:Barbara Thorndyke is coming here? Wow.
OTHERMALE:I've never met a real author before.
OTHERFEMALE:I have.
LEADFEMALE:I once stood in line two hours at a bookstore for Arnold Schwarzenegger's autograph.
LEADFEMALE:When I think of great literary figures of our time, it's usually, uh, Faulkner, Fitzgerald, and Schwarzenegger.
SUPFEMALE:Schwarzenegger.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Did he sign your book?
OTHERMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:But only after he refused to sign my thigh.
OTHERFEMALE:He was probably intimidated to see a thigh bigger than his.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Ma.
SUPMALE:Anybody want a lasagna? I thought you made that for your friend.
SUPMALE:He said he had lunch already.
SUPFEMALE:I offered to go to his place and warm it up for supper.
LEADFEMALE:He said no.
SUPMALE:The key is to make a man think you're not interested in him.
LEADMALE:Offering to make him dinner made you look too easy.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
SUPFEMALE:Black underwear and pasties couldn't make me look easy.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Barbara, please, come in.
SUPMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:Oh, hello.
LEADMALE:These are my friends.
LEADFEMALE:That's Blanche Devereaux.
SUPMALE:Rose Nylund.
SUPFEMALE:How do you do? Sit down.
LEADMALE:Sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Barbara, Dorothy tells us you're an author.
SUPFEMALE:No, I'm just a writer.
LEADFEMALE:Malamud's an author.
SUPFEMALE:I thought malamuds were chocolate cookies with marshmallows in the middle.
LEADFEMALE:Those are mallomars, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I want you to have a copy of my latest novel.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Scarlet Dawn at Boca Raton.
LEADMALE:Read the inscription.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:"To Dorothy Zbornak, a new and fascinating friend.
SUPMALE:" Oh, thank you so much.
SUPFEMALE:I'm really touched.
SUPMALE:I'll get the coffee and let you get to know each other.
OTHERFEMALE:Barbara, that is a stunning brooch.
OTHERFEMALE:Wherever did you get it? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I was in Morocco working on a novel, not to mention a dashing young Moroccan, Oh! When I had a severe attack of writer's block.
SUPFEMALE:My head was devoid of all ideas and thoughts.
LEADMALE:That happens to me a lot.
SUPMALE:Do you write? No.
SUPMALE:Why do you ask? Go on, Barbara.
SUPMALE:I went for a walk in a crowded marketplace.
LEADMALE:A man came up behind me, put something in my hand, and said, "This is what you need.
SUPFEMALE:" That happened to me once in the produce section at the A&P.
SUPFEMALE:Well, anyway, the man gave me the brooch, and since then, I've never had any problem writing.
OTHERFEMALE:This is my muse, my artistic inspiration, the embodiment of my creativity.
LEADFEMALE:And you know what's even better? It goes with anything.
LEADFEMALE:It might be a little tricky with plaid.
OTHERMALE:I'd be careful if I were you.
SUPMALE:You missed the point of my story.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Run it by us again.
LEADMALE:I think not.
SUPMALE:So, um, you bowl? I beg your pardon? How's it going? I've had the most delightful conversation with Rose and Madge.
SUPMALE:That's Blanche.
LEADMALE:Oh, of course.
LEADMALE:However I just remembered a previous engagement.
SUPMALE:I have to go.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's too bad.
LEADMALE:Well, at least let me walk you to your car.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think? There's something about her I don't like.
OTHERFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:I find her hard to talk to.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:She thinks I'm dumb.
SUPFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, have you decided who you're gonna be at the ball? Yes.
SUPMALE:I'm going as Eve from the Garden of Eden.
SUPMALE:All I'll need is a few strategically placed leaves.
LEADFEMALE:What about a snake?
LEADMALE:I already have a snake.
OTHERMALE:I'm going with Hank Crinland.
LEADFEMALE:He's a whiplash attorney.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, Rose and I are going to the movies.
LEADFEMALE:You wanna go? I can't tonight.
LEADMALE:Barbara's taking me to the experimental theater downtown.
SUPFEMALE:Somebody dragged me to a show there one time.
SUPMALE:Three men paraded around the stage for five hours talking about God and eating graham crackers.
LEADMALE:They wore masks, but other than that, they were totally naked.
LEADFEMALE:You stayed through the whole evening? Well, I would've left, but one of the actors looked so familiar to me.
LEADMALE:But it was hard to tell since he had such a small part.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, come with us.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll have a lot more fun.
OTHERMALE:Besides, that Barbara is so snooty.
SUPMALE:How can you say that? You hardly know her.
LEADFEMALE:Why doesn't she include us in plans she makes with you? Because you have different interests.
LEADFEMALE:Is it too much to ask of my best friends that they respect my right to have different interests and people in my life?
LEADFEMALE:I guess not.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:And I promise we'll do something together real soon.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay? Maybe she's right.
SUPMALE:We didn't give Barbara much of a chance.
SUPMALE:First impressions can be wrong.
LEADMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:I remember when I was little back in St.
SUPFEMALE:Olaf.
LEADMALE:There was this old lady who lived up the street.
LEADMALE:She never smiled.
LEADFEMALE:She always looked angry.
OTHERMALE:The kids said she'd kill anyone who even stepped on her property.
SUPMALE:We called her Mean Old Lady Higgenlooper.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, kids can be pretty cruel.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:That was her name.
LEADFEMALE:Mean Old Lady Higgenlooper.
LEADFEMALE:She had it changed legally 'cause everybody called her that anyway.
SUPFEMALE:Then how come your name isn't Big Dummy? There were already three other people in town with that name.
SUPMALE:But that's beside the point.
SUPFEMALE:One day I got up the courage to go up to Mean Old Lady Higgenlooper and ask her why she always frowned.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she had been born with no smiling muscles.
SUPMALE:I pointed out that a frown is just a smile turned upside down.
OTHERFEMALE:So from then on, whenever I'd go by, she'd stand on her head and wave.
SUPFEMALE:That is one of the stupidest stories I've ever heard.
LEADMALE:Which proves my first impression of you was right.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I have an idea.
LEADMALE:Why don't we invite Barbara over for dinner and give her another chance? Why not? If it makes Dorothy happy.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go to the movies.
LEADMALE:Rose, what was your first impression of me? I thought you wore too much makeup and were a slut.
LEADFEMALE:I was wrong.
LEADMALE:You don't wear too much makeup.
LEADFEMALE:And so Dorothy Parker turned to Alexander Woollcott and said, "If you laid all the women in this room end to end, I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
SUPMALE:" Very clever.
LEADMALE:Very, very clever.
LEADMALE:I can't remember hearing anything more clever.
SUPFEMALE:Unless it was last week on Alf, when the cat next door I'll go get the after-dinner drinks.
LEADFEMALE:Barbara, I picked up your first novel the other day.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, yes.
SUPMALE:So Dark the Waves on Biscayne Bay.
LEADFEMALE:I've grown so much as a writer since then.
LEADMALE:Well, I should hope so.
SUPMALE:Blanche.
LEADMALE:It's all right.
LEADFEMALE:Did you have a problem with my book? Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.
SUPFEMALE:All those waves.
LEADFEMALE:Big waves, little waves.
LEADMALE:Dark waves rolling in.
OTHERMALE:Page after page.
OTHERFEMALE:I had to take a Dramamine to get through chapter three.
SUPMALE:Blanche, the waves are a metaphor.
OTHERMALE:You see, a metaphor I know what a metaphor is, dear.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not a dummy.
LEADMALE:Blanche, what's a metaphor? It's when you use a phrase to mean something else.
OTHERMALE:Like when I say, "Men are blinded by my beauty," they're not really blinded.
LEADFEMALE:They get their sight back in a day or two.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Barbara, this is my mother, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Ah.
OTHERMALE:Sophia, your daughter is one of the most beautiful people I've ever met.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you writers never stop using your imagination.
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Well, good-bye.
SUPMALE:Where are you going? It's Saturday night.
OTHERMALE:I'm all dressed up.
LEADMALE:There's a car honking for me.
SUPFEMALE:Think, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Remember something called "a date"? Well, I'd better be going to.
LEADFEMALE:But it's still so early.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we could all have a game of oogle and floogle.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe I've ever heard of that.
OTHERMALE:We used to play it back in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf.
LEADMALE:It's an adult version of hide-and-go-seek.
SUPMALE:And how does it differ from the children's version? Adults play it.
LEADMALE:Of course.
LEADMALE:I should have known.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take a rain check.
LEADFEMALE:It was so nice of you to come by.
LEADMALE:I have an extra ticket for the writers symposium on Friday.
SUPFEMALE:Would you like to come? I'd love to, Barbara.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Anything for a friend.
LEADMALE:Ciao.
SUPMALE:Ciao.
LEADMALE:And good-bye to you, too, Barbara.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, the masquerade ball is Friday night.
SUPFEMALE:You know how much it means to me.
OTHERMALE:I'm counting on you to be the rear end of my horse.
LEADMALE:Rose, sweetheart, this Friday I can choose between rubbing elbows with Norman Mailer, or doing the hokey-pokey in a horse costume with your behind in my face.
SUPFEMALE:Well, which is it gonna be? Rose, honey, pass me the tuffy.
LEADFEMALE:With pleasure, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:You're welcome, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:You can always count on me to hand you the tuffy.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why I always ask you.
LEADMALE:I think I saw Jack and Janet give Chrissy this treatment on an episode of Three's Company.
LEADMALE:Oh, at last, a reference from Dorothy that even we illiterates can understand.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess her well of knowledge has run dry.
LEADFEMALE:That's a metaphor, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Why is it so important that I go to this masquerade ball? Because it's so important to Rose.
SUPFEMALE:She's crushed, torn up, devastated by your shocking insensitivity to her feelings.
LEADFEMALE:I don't feel that bad.
OTHERMALE:Shut up, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I never said I was going.
LEADMALE:Since when do we have to say we're going? We've gone for the past five years.
LEADMALE:We may hate it, but we always go.
LEADFEMALE:You never told me you hated it.
SUPMALE:I'm a good friend.
LEADFEMALE:A good friend would never say anything like that.
SUPMALE:I appreciate that.
OTHERFEMALE:Just admit that this is because you don't like Barbara.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like Barbara.
SUPMALE:I think she's a phony.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:This from a woman who tells her dates that she was Angie Dickinson's body double in Dressed to Kill.
OTHERFEMALE:That's just a little white lie.
LEADFEMALE:Then why is it on your job resumé? Blanche is right, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Barbara is not very nice.
SUPMALE:She looks down on everybody except you.
LEADFEMALE:That's only 'cause you look up to her.
OTHERMALE:That is ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:You don't notice how she uses her intelligence to make everybody else look stupid.
LEADMALE:Like at supper when she asked us to pass the salt in Latin.
SUPMALE:She cares more about words than she does about people.
LEADFEMALE:You have a right to have your own friends, but it takes a good friend to point out your mistakes, and you're making one with Barbara.
LEADFEMALE:How dare you make judgments like that.
LEADFEMALE:And how dare you tell me who my friends should be.
SUPFEMALE:Barbara, this place is incredible.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:It's the hangout for Miami's literary intelligentsia.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, thank you.
LEADMALE:Well, I've never seen a menu with a table of contents before.
SUPFEMALE:Skip ahead to chapter five.
SUPMALE:It's the lunch menu.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, gee, everything sounds so good.
LEADFEMALE:The Crepes of Wrath.
SUPMALE:The Old Man and the Seafood Salad.
OTHERMALE:I think I will have the For Whom the Stuffed Bell Pepper Tolls.
SUPFEMALE:I'll have a turkey sandwich on Catcher in the Rye bread with a side order of George Bernard Slaw.
SUPFEMALE:Barbara, I've really come to value our friendship.
LEADMALE:That's why I feel I can talk to you about something.
OTHERFEMALE:Feel free.
LEADFEMALE:If I had a problem, I'd wanna confide in someone like me.
LEADFEMALE:Ever since we became friends, there has been a great deal of tension between Blanche and Rose and me.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't mean to infringe on your friendship.
LEADMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:It's not your fault.
LEADFEMALE:The problem is they feel left out of our friendship, and I don't know what to do about it.
OTHERMALE:Face it, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Blanche and Rose are limited.
SUPMALE:Well, I admit I get tired of hearing about Blanche's dates and Rose's relatives back in St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf, but they are very good friends.
LEADMALE:If you like them, I must have overlooked something.
OTHERMALE:I have an idea.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't I invite everybody and their dates for dinner at the Mortimer Club? The Mortimer Club? Barbara, that is the most exclusive club in town.
LEADFEMALE:Here we are, ladies.
LEADMALE:I didn't order the French fries.
LEADMALE:Oh, right.
LEADFEMALE:You get the Edgar Allan Poe-tatoes and the Ice Water Cometh.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, a little of that goes a very long way.
SUPMALE:I'm having second thoughts about spending another evening with Barbara.
LEADMALE:I don't think it'll hurt to give her another chance.
OTHERMALE:We're going to the Mortimer Club.
LEADFEMALE:What's the big deal? Rose, the wealthiest men in Florida go there.
LEADFEMALE:It's been my experience that wealthy men make the best lovers.
LEADMALE:Is that true? No.
SUPMALE:But if you tell them that, sometimes they'll take you to the mall and let you use their credit card for 45 minutes.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, honey, I hope you don't mind.
OTHERMALE:I borrowed your rhinestone necklace.
OTHERFEMALE:No, but I should point out it was designed for a dainty neck.
OTHERMALE:Yes, Blanche, but I don't know Mike Tyson well enough to borrow his jewelry.
LEADMALE: Hello, Madge.
OTHERFEMALE:That's Blanche.
LEADMALE:Oh, didn't I say that? This is my date, Norman.
LEADFEMALE:He's a student in my creative writing course.
LEADMALE:I didn't know you taught high school.
SUPMALE:Norman and I are the same age spiritually.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, if you can get him to buy that, more power to you.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Barbara.
SUPMALE:Hi, Dorothy, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:I certainly hope tonight will help us forget what happened the other night.
LEADFEMALE:I already forgot what happened the other night.
LEADMALE:But I'm 82 years old.
SUPMALE:This morning I forgot my cat's been dead for 20 years.
LEADMALE:Which makes me 
LEADFEMALE:Who's using the kitty litter?  Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Come in.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Murray, what a snazzy tux.
LEADFEMALE:I better not let you out of my sight tonight.
SUPFEMALE:That's my daughter Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:These are her friends.
LEADMALE:Everybody, I'd like you to meet Murray Guttman.
OTHERMALE:How do you do? Murray, such a pleasure to meet you.
LEADMALE:Nice to meet you, too.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, could I see you in the kitchen for a second? We have a little problem.
SUPMALE:We do?
OTHERFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Murray Guttman? Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe we can get him to turn his jacket inside out.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sure the lining isn't as loud.
LEADMALE:His tuxedo has nothing to do with it.
LEADFEMALE:I don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:He can't come to the club.
OTHERFEMALE:Why not?
SUPFEMALE:Guttman.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talking about? Guttman.
SUPFEMALE:He's Jewish, isn't he? I don't know.
LEADMALE:What difference does it make? Oh, a big difference.
OTHERFEMALE:The Mortimer Club is restricted.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you a member of a club like that? Because they serve a great breakfast and the parking is free.
SUPMALE:Besides, it's their policy, not mine.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but you tolerate it.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I tolerate a lot of things.
LEADMALE:For instance, I'm tolerating this evening with Rose and Blanche because of my friendship with you.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe I'm hearing this.
SUPFEMALE:Let's not make a big thing out of this.
SUPFEMALE:We can't go to the Mortimer Club.
SUPFEMALE:We'll go to another restaurant.
OTHERMALE:Boy, did I misjudge you.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche and Rose were right.
SUPFEMALE:You are not the kind of person I want as a friend.
SUPFEMALE:Go to the Mortimer Club by yourself.
LEADFEMALE:I don't understand.
LEADMALE:Let me spell it out for you.
SUPFEMALE:Go to hell.
SUPFEMALE:Hmm? Dorothy, what happened? Barbara just stormed out of here.
LEADMALE:She's not coming back.
LEADFEMALE:Both of you were right about her.
SUPMALE:I can't believe that I couldn't see it.
LEADFEMALE:Can you ever forgive me? What do you think? Should we give her another chance? We better.
LEADFEMALE:Best friends are hard to come by.
SUPFEMALE:Does this mean you'll go to the masquerade ball? Yes.
SUPMALE:And I'll tell you something.
OTHERMALE:After all the practice I have had lately, I'd be honored to be the horse's behind.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, oh, oh, oh! 
LEADFEMALE:
