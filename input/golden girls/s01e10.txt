SUPFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, y'all.
LEADFEMALE:And drive carefully.
SUPFEMALE:This wind is terrible.
LEADMALE:See you next week.
LEADFEMALE:Bye! Goodbye!
LEADFEMALE:Oh!
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what a party! Oh, Ma, I tell you, that meal was absolutely incredible.
LEADMALE:Oh, it was fantastic, Sophia, really fantastic.
LEADFEMALE:I know, I know.
SUPMALE:Did you see that Emma Jane eat?
SUPMALE:Oh! I could not believe my eyes! That woman must weigh 275 pounds.
SUPMALE:She never stopped shoving it in.
OTHERFEMALE:And then she had to talk the entire time.
SUPFEMALE:She just sprayed food all over the table, like a mist! I got it in my hair.
LEADMALE:It was hitting me like pellets.
LEADMALE:I got a piece of rice in my eye.
LEADFEMALE:She could have put my eye out.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I never had food like that in my life.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I spent a summer in Italy four years ago.
SUPFEMALE:I never ate this well.
LEADMALE:'Course, I never ate.
OTHERFEMALE:Who'd have the time or the energy, if you get my drift.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose.
LEADMALE:Italian men are just the sexiest, most romantic, most gorgeous men in the world.
LEADMALE:Of course they worshipped me because I'm blonde and feminine and young, with a great body.
LEADMALE:What mirror do you use? Oh, Sophia, now, you've done enough.
SUPMALE:Girls, we're doing the dishes.
SUPMALE:You just sit.
LEADMALE:Fine with me.
LEADMALE:I'm exhausted.
SUPFEMALE:I've been cooking for two days.
LEADFEMALE:I offered to help you, Sophia, but you said "no.
OTHERFEMALE:" You're Scandinavian.
LEADFEMALE:What do you know, a thousand ways to make herring? Well, not a thousand, but a lot, and I'm famous for my Lindstrom surprise.
LEADFEMALE:What in the world is that?
OTHERFEMALE:Herring pie.
LEADFEMALE:The surprise is, you think it's pie, like apple, but when you bite into it, it's herring! Oh, what fun! It was.
LEADFEMALE:My cat was named Lindstrom.
LEADFEMALE:I used to make it for him on his birthday and other holidays.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait, your last name was Lindstrom.
LEADFEMALE:You named your cat Lindstrom Lindstrom? Yes, it was less confusing for him.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna clear the stuff from inside.
OTHERMALE:She's something.
OTHERMALE:A real pistol.
LEADFEMALE:The energy she has
SUPFEMALE:look at this meal she made.
LEADFEMALE:It's just incredible.
SUPFEMALE:You know, she's starting to clear up.
SUPMALE:We can't let her do that.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:She's done enough for one night.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, now listen
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy.
SUPMALE:I ate too much scungilli.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter?
LEADMALE:I got a bubble.
SUPFEMALE:Why are you rubbing your chest?
LEADMALE:The bubble is in my chest.
SUPMALE:What do you mean, you have a bubble? Is it pain? If it was pain, I'd call it pain.
OTHERFEMALE:I have a bubble.
LEADMALE:Blanche, do you know what a bubble is? I know what a bauble is.
LEADMALE:I know what it is.
LEADFEMALE:I've had a bubble.
LEADMALE:In your head.
LEADFEMALE:A bubble is something that just sits there and presses until it's chased away by a you-know-what.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:What, Rose, a highway patrolman?
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:What? A big belch.
LEADFEMALE:You couldn't say "belch"? What is it, a Viking curse? Well, it's not the nicest word in the world.
SUPMALE:Right now, it would be the nicest sound in the world.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, you know, you don't look good.
LEADMALE:I'm short and I'm old.
LEADFEMALE:What did you expect, Princess Di?
LEADMALE:I think we should call the doctor.
LEADFEMALE:I don't need a doctor! Blanche, would you call, please? The number's by my bed
LEADMALE:Dr.
OTHERMALE:Harris.
SUPFEMALE:I hate doctors.
OTHERFEMALE:The only doctor I ever liked was Dr.
SUPMALE:Clyde, our vet.
SUPFEMALE:He was wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:My mother wanted him to do her hysterectomy, but he wouldn't.
OTHERFEMALE:But he was willing to do her lobotomy.
SUPMALE:Ooh!
LEADMALE:What, Ma? What?
LEADMALE:Pain.
SUPMALE:What kind of pain?
LEADFEMALE:The kind that hurts.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, lie down.
LEADFEMALE:Just lie down.
SUPFEMALE:What if I'm having a heart attack?
LEADMALE:You're not having a heart attack.
LEADFEMALE:How do you know? You're not a doctor.
OTHERMALE:Why do you think you're having a heart attack? I'm 80 years old, I got Pavarotti sitting on my chest, odds are it's a heart attack! The doctor was out.
SUPMALE:They're trying to locate him, so I called the paramedics
LEADMALE:and they're on the way.
OTHERMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, do we have heart disease in our family?
LEADFEMALE:No, Ma.
SUPMALE:How did Uncle Mario die? Don't you remember? He was carrying out the garbage and dropped his gun, and it went off and shot him in the forehead.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, right.
SUPFEMALE:What a klutz.
LEADMALE:Didn't Aunt Teresa have a heart attack? Aunt Teresa didn't have a heart.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Nunzio? Uncle Nunzio died to get away from Aunt Teresa.
LEADMALE:My mother died of old age and my father fell off a donkey,
LEADMALE:so we got healthy hearts in our family.
OTHERMALE:Very, very healthy.
LEADMALE:That's good.
LEADMALE:That's a good thing.
LEADFEMALE:There shouldn't be heart attacks or cancer, or anything like that.
LEADMALE:There should just be a certain age where you have to turn your life in, like a library book.
SUPMALE:You pack a bag, you go, and that's that.
SUPFEMALE:I wouldn't know what to pack.
SUPMALE:The real question is, do they have dry cleaners there? Oh, dry cleaners die.
LEADMALE:There's probably a slew of dry cleaners.
OTHERMALE:Will you two please shut up?
SUPMALE:Oh! I'm s
LEADMALE:How about if I make coffee?
OTHERMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Good idea.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I'll come help.
LEADMALE:What if I die, Dorothy?
SUPMALE:Ma, you're not going to die.
SUPFEMALE:Now, look.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want you to talk, just rest.
LEADFEMALE:Rest? I could be history in 20 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:I got some things I have to tell you.
SUPFEMALE:The key to my safe-deposit box
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma, please! Don't interrupt.
SUPFEMALE:Don't let your Aunt Renata come to the services.
SUPMALE:It's my death.
LEADMALE:She'll make it her moment.
OTHERMALE:Ma, look
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, you were always my favorite.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to know that.
SUPMALE:Maybe I didn't show it.
LEADMALE:I'm not an affectionate person.
OTHERFEMALE:But you are.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell your sister, and keep the silver.
SUPFEMALE:OK, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I'll probably see your father in heaven.
SUPMALE:I haven't seen him in 30 years.
OTHERMALE:I wish there was time to get my hair done.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it isn't a heart attack.
LEADMALE:She's 80.
LEADFEMALE:At 80, something's got to go.
LEADMALE:Well, not necessarily.
LEADMALE:My grandparents lived till their 90s.
LEADMALE:One was 102.
LEADMALE:In Minnesota.
SUPFEMALE:So? Rose, you know how they freeze dead people to preserve them and then bring them back? That's like living in Minnesota.
LEADMALE:The cold slows down the aging process.
SUPFEMALE:I would move there in a shot if only they had men there.
LEADFEMALE:We have men in Minnesota.
LEADFEMALE:Farmers, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Farmers.
OTHERMALE:I'm an idiot!
SUPMALE:Why?
SUPMALE:I didn't think this would happen.
SUPFEMALE:What? Death.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't really think I'd die.
LEADMALE:Ma, maybe someday, but not today.
LEADFEMALE:It could be today, and you know what? I'm not ready.
LEADFEMALE:as a complete surprise.
SUPMALE:Ma, you're OK.
SUPFEMALE:You are not going to die.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to.
LEADFEMALE:Who does? You know, I'd settle for even just one more day.
LEADFEMALE:God knows why.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow I'm cleaning the closets.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, I love you.
LEADMALE:You know what, Dorothy?
SUPMALE:What?
LEADFEMALE:Death sucks.
LEADMALE:Do you want to be buried or cremated?
OTHERMALE:Neither.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you want to be, flushed down the toilet like a goldfish? I wouldn't want to be cremated.
SUPMALE:I hate heat.
LEADMALE:And burial? I hate small spaces.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a little claustrophobic.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, you're not gonna know anything.
LEADMALE:You're gonna be dead.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, then, burial, I guess.
LEADFEMALE:But will you promise to put a blanket in with me?
OTHERFEMALE:Why?
LEADMALE:Oh, I'd just feel more comfortable cozier.
LEADMALE:And I'd want my pictures of Charlie and the animals.
SUPFEMALE:You know, the ones in the little silver frames.
SUPFEMALE:And-And my pictures of the children.
LEADMALE:And, of course, if I'm married again, I'd want a picture of my new husband.
OTHERMALE:And the candlesticks Mama gave me
LEADMALE:Rose, it's a coffin, not a condo.
LEADFEMALE:This is a very depressing conversation.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I want a fancy funeral.
LEADFEMALE:I want a big parade with a riderless horse.
LEADFEMALE:And I want to lie in state, and then be buried in Arlington Cemetery.
SUPFEMALE:Why Arlington Cemetery?
LEADFEMALE:Because it's full of men.
SUPFEMALE:But they're all dead.
LEADMALE:So are the men I date.
LEADMALE:And I'm sorry I never tried acting.
SUPFEMALE:I always wanted to act.
LEADFEMALE:Coffee's ready.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Sophia, you feeling a little better?
LEADMALE:Oh, my God, she's
OTHERMALE:I'm not dead, I'm resting.
SUPMALE:Of course you're not dead.
LEADFEMALE:Not yet.
SUPMALE:Oh, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Don't "Ma" me.
LEADFEMALE:Listen.
LEADMALE:Before you know it, I could be gone, and we won't have said some important stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:I love you, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Just remember that I love you very, very much.
LEADMALE:And I love you, Ma very, very much.
LEADMALE:I couldn't love you more.
OTHERMALE:And you two, Heckle and Jeckle.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you for letting me live here.
OTHERFEMALE:It was some treat.
LEADFEMALE:You made an old lady feel young again.
SUPMALE:You're OK.
LEADMALE:We love you, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:We sure do.
LEADFEMALE:This is nice, to die with friends.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna close my eyes now, but I'm only resting.
OTHERMALE:Oh God, where are the paramedics? I'll go call them again.
SUPMALE:Rose, you stay with Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, she'll be fine.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure it isn't a heart attack.
LEADMALE:A heart attack's bigger.
LEADMALE:I've seen a heart attack.
SUPMALE:Charlie had a heart attack.
LEADMALE:And it wasn't like this?
OTHERMALE:Oh, it was much worse.
LEADFEMALE:If only the paramedics would get here.
LEADFEMALE:Charlie made me dress him when he had his heart attack, before the paramedics got there.
LEADFEMALE:What, he wasn't dressed? We were making love.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Rose, honey, you never told me.
SUPFEMALE:He died while you were making love? He didn't die then.
LEADMALE:He had his heart attack then and he told me to dress him.
OTHERFEMALE:And?
LEADFEMALE:And I dressed him.
LEADMALE:And then we had a fight.
SUPMALE:I grabbed a pair of white pants and I was putting them on him, and Charlie said it was after Labor Day and he couldn't wear white.
OTHERMALE:In the middle of a heart attack? Oh, Charlie was very stubborn and very dapper.
LEADFEMALE:And then what happened? And he told me he loved me and then it was over.
OTHERFEMALE:And I put a pair of gray flannel pants on him and a blue shirt, and striped tie.
SUPMALE:And he was all dressed when the paramedics got there.
SUPFEMALE:Girls, come here a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, it's gonna be awhile.
LEADMALE:There's lots of trees down and accidents because of the storm, so the paramedics can't get through right away.
LEADMALE:Oh, we have to do something.
OTHERMALE:I mean, she needs help.
LEADFEMALE:We can drive her.
OTHERMALE:That's right.
SUPFEMALE:The hospital's 20 minutes from here.
OTHERFEMALE:If the paramedics can't get through, what makes you think we can? We could get out there and get stuck.
SUPFEMALE:I think we ought to just wait for help.
LEADFEMALE:But she could be dying! But what can we do? Pray.
LEADMALE:Wait and pray.
SUPFEMALE:Aah! What, Ma? What? What? You're sitting on top of me, I open my eyes, I see pores like that, I think I'm on the moon.
SUPMALE:Did you have a nice nap, Sophia? I didn't have a nap.
LEADFEMALE:I died a little.
LEADMALE:I went to heaven.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Ma.
SUPMALE:You just slept, is all.
SUPMALE:You were there? Don't tell me where I went.
SUPMALE:I went to heaven.
LEADFEMALE:I saw the golden light and some angels in white robes with harps.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I was in Saks at Christmas, but then I saw your father.
LEADMALE:Really?
OTHERFEMALE:He was surrounded by women.
SUPMALE:He's in heaven.
LEADFEMALE:Did you see God and Jesus?
LEADMALE:They were busy.
SUPMALE:I think I'll go back.
OTHERMALE:Ma, don't go.
LEADFEMALE:No, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:It's a wonderful place.
LEADMALE:I'm very excited about it.
OTHERMALE:Ma, I want you here.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, are there lots of men in heaven?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I'd like to know.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, get me my rosary.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, Sophia.
LEADMALE:What about men? Are there lots of men in heaven?
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, come on!
LEADFEMALE:You asked her about God and Jesus.
OTHERFEMALE:Is there anything else we can get you, Sophia? A little tea, perhaps? I'm not in England.
SUPFEMALE:I'm having a heart attack.
LEADMALE:Keep her company.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna help Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Sophia, you know, I always thought there'd be a Catholic heaven, with nuns and priests and churches.
SUPMALE:And then a separate, Protestant heaven, with people and cows and horses.
SUPFEMALE:And then a Jewish heaven, with libraries and furriers and You're starting to annoy me.
LEADMALE:You shouldn't annoy a sick person.
SUPFEMALE:Oh Sophia, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm just trying to help.
SUPFEMALE:You want to help? Be quiet.
LEADMALE:I'll be quiet, but just don't close your eyes all right? Don't-Don't close your eyes.
LEADMALE:Did you find them?
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, Blanche, what if she dies? She's a tough lady, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:If anyone's a survivor, she is.
LEADMALE:If she dies, I'll be an orphan.
LEADMALE:Can you believe it? I'm over 50 years old, and I'll still feel like an orphan.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it doesn't matter.
LEADMALE:You lose a parent, you might as well be six.
SUPMALE:It's scary, and it pushes you right up to the head of the line.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Oh, God, I don't know what I'll do.
OTHERFEMALE:I love that lady so much.
LEADFEMALE:She's my family.
LEADFEMALE:We're your family too, Dorothy, and you remember that.
LEADMALE:We might not be blood, but we're here.
LEADMALE:Oh God, I miss her already.
LEADMALE:So there I was with no vet, and Petunia was about to give birth to her piglets.
LEADMALE:Well, I just didn't know what to do.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I had helped deliver Bessie the cow, but Petunia was so much more difficult.
LEADMALE:She- If I died, would you stop telling this story? Sophia, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I was just trying to get your mind off things.
OTHERMALE:I want my mind on things.
LEADMALE:I've got to make my peace, and I need some peace to do it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be quiet.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Here are your beads, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:I found them in a can of peanut brittle.
LEADMALE:Of course.
OTHERFEMALE:That's where I keep them.
SUPFEMALE:(doorbell
LEADMALE:Oh, the paramedics.
OTHERMALE:Do I have lipstick on my teeth? Oh, Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Harris, thank God you're here.
SUPMALE:Here she is.
LEADFEMALE:So, what's this, Sophia? I hear we're not feeling well.
LEADFEMALE:We? What are you, a partner?
SUPFEMALE:Where's the pain?
LEADMALE:My heart.
LEADFEMALE:Show me where.
SUPMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:You hungry? You want some food? We got a lot left over.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, fix him a plate.
LEADFEMALE:Later, Ma.
OTHERMALE:Now, breathe normally.
LEADFEMALE:I could be dead.
OTHERFEMALE:I won't know whether he liked it.
LEADMALE:Sophia, please.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't hear and I ate at my mother's.
SUPFEMALE:What did you eat?
OTHERFEMALE:Kreplach.
OTHERFEMALE:You're Jewish?
LEADMALE:All right now, relax.
OTHERMALE:How come so many doctors are Jewish? Because their mothers are.
LEADMALE:Oh, oh, oh, oh.
SUPFEMALE:Did that hurt? No, I'm singing rock 'n' roll.
LEADMALE:Of course it hurts!
LEADFEMALE:What did you have for dinner?
LEADMALE:I didn't have any dinner.
LEADMALE:All right, tell me everything you ate today.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:A little of this, a little of that.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, she had scungilli.
SUPFEMALE:And I saw her eat some sausages and peppers.
OTHERMALE:I saw her eat some fettuccine Alfredo,
SUPFEMALE:and fried mozzarella.
LEADFEMALE:Are you kidding? And then this afternoon she had the cannelloni and the mushrooms with Gorgonzola.
OTHERMALE:Bring him a plate of those.
SUPFEMALE:Those were great.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, go! Oh, and the Milk Duds, remember? You had those two boxes of Milk Duds.
SUPFEMALE:Milk Duds? They're delicious.
SUPFEMALE:I love them.
SUPMALE:The trouble is, they take out my dentures.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, I don't think you're having a heart attack.
SUPFEMALE:It's most likely a gallbladder attack, brought on by overeating.
LEADMALE:Overeating, by the way, is a gross understatement for what you've described to me.
LEADMALE:You simply cannot go on eating like that at your age! You can't eat like that at any age.
SUPFEMALE:But she didn't have a heart attack, you're absolutely sure? I've got a portable EKG machine in the car.
LEADFEMALE:I'll double-check, but it doesn't seem like a heart attack.
OTHERFEMALE:She's got classic gallbladder symptoms
SUPMALE:a tenderness in the upper right quadrant, a slight discoloration of the whites of her eyes.
SUPMALE:Try this.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me you're not in heaven.
LEADMALE:Sophia, I can't, really.
LEADMALE:One bite, for God's sake! Isn't it a little rude for him to be eating while she's having a heart attack? She's not having a heart attack.
SUPMALE:Mmm.
SUPMALE:That's good.
SUPFEMALE:Give me one of those.
LEADFEMALE:Hide this stuff!
LEADMALE:Where shall I hide it?
LEADMALE:In your brassiere, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:Just throw it away.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna get the EKG machine.
LEADMALE:I'll be right back.
OTHERMALE:I'll call the paramedics and tell them not to come.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thanks, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, is he single or what? Or what.
OTHERFEMALE:Happily?
SUPFEMALE:Happily.
LEADMALE:Damn.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, what a relief.
LEADFEMALE:You're telling me.
LEADMALE:I thought I was a goner.
OTHERMALE:It's incredible.
LEADFEMALE:You think you're dying, you feel death enter your body.
LEADFEMALE:The doctor comes, he says you're fine, you're ready to swim the English Channel.
LEADMALE:I can't tell you how happy I am.
LEADMALE:I want you around for a long, long time.
LEADMALE:They'll have to murder me.
OTHERFEMALE:Though, I must admit, I was a little excited about seeing your father again.
SUPMALE:Ma, you feeling OK?
LEADMALE:I'll live.
LEADMALE:Listen, I'm sorry if I scared you.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, don't worry about it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just thrilled that you're OK and 'cause I'm happy that, you know, I'm your favorite.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about, favorite? You know, you told me that I'm your favorite.
LEADFEMALE:Please! What favorite? Are you kidding? I thought I was dying.
LEADMALE:Favorite? Boy, what a night.
LEADMALE:You said it.
SUPMALE:It sure makes you think.
LEADMALE:Sure does.
LEADFEMALE:About what? About our policy in Guatemala.
OTHERMALE:About death, Rose.
OTHERMALE:Oh, death.
LEADFEMALE:Are you prepared either of you? I mean, really prepared for death? For somebody else's death.
LEADFEMALE:I have a stunning black dress.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if I've thought about it
SUPFEMALE:you know, the fact that I will die
LEADMALE:then how can I take seriously most of the things I take seriously?
OTHERMALE:Like?
LEADFEMALE:Like eating, for example.
SUPMALE:I mean, why starve myself to the point of thinness if I know that I could die tomorrow? I mean, why not eat the chocolate cake?
LEADFEMALE:What chocolate cake?
LEADFEMALE:The chocolate cake in the refrigerator.
LEADMALE:You know, you have a point, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Here we are, not eating chocolate cake, which we obviously adore, because we want to stay very thin, and then drop dead.
OTHERFEMALE:That's nuts.
SUPFEMALE:But we might be thin and stay alive.
LEADFEMALE:But not forever, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:We're not gonna stay alive forever.
LEADMALE:That's Dorothy's point.
LEADFEMALE:And when you're gonna die anyhow, what's it matter? Yeah, I mean, what does it matter if you know that you're gonna end up dying anyway? You might as well do what you want to do.
LEADMALE:Like having ice cream on the chocolate cake.
LEADMALE:You know, I knew someone who went to this fabulous restaurant in Paris and just had watercress for lunch because, you know, she didn't want to gain weight.
LEADFEMALE:And then after lunch, she walked out of the restaurant and a gargoyle fell off the building, hit her on the head, and killed her.
SUPMALE: Oh, no.
SUPMALE:Look at what her last meal was.
OTHERMALE:That is tragic, just tragic.
SUPMALE:Here, honey, dig in.
SUPFEMALE:'Course, it will be just my luck.
OTHERMALE:I'll eat, I'll gain 40 pounds, and live to be 90.
OTHERMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:I'm healthy as a horse.
LEADFEMALE:Unfortunately, I'll wind up looking like one.
LEADFEMALE:All it takes is one little dessert and my panties cut off my circulation.
LEADFEMALE:I pass.
OTHERFEMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not touching that.
SUPFEMALE:I put on 12 pounds just from dinner alone.
LEADMALE:Let's go for a walk.
LEADMALE:Right, burn it off.
SUPMALE:Are you kidding? After what we ate, we'd have to walk to Canada.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mounties.
LEADFEMALE:I love Canadian men! 
SUPMALE:
