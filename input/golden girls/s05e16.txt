LEADFEMALE:Woe is me.
LEADFEMALE:Woe, O, woe is me! Problem, Blanche? Yes.
OTHERMALE:It's my hair
LEADFEMALE:it has split ends, it's dull and listless, it makes my face look Its age? If you're gonna make fun of somebody, make fun of Rose.
LEADMALE:I need the professional care of the most talented hairdresser in Miami
SUPMALE:Robert.
OTHERMALE:Oh, he's brilliant.
LEADMALE:Do you know he was the first one ever to use mousse? I'd check my facts if I were you, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Ingrid of St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf has been using moose ever since I can remember.
OTHERMALE:Of course, it's his own professional secret which part of the moose he uses.
SUPFEMALE:But it'll keep your hair in place in winds up to I just don't believe you, Rose! Ask Conway Twitty.
LEADMALE:The problem is, Robert charges $300, and it's just not in my budget this month.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's the trouble with being beautiful
LEADMALE:the maintenance will kill you.
LEADFEMALE:I have an idea, Blanche.
LEADMALE:How about moonlighting and making some extra money? Another job? Rose, I already work my fingers to the bone "Picasso on your left, snack bar downstairs.
LEADFEMALE:" It's a wonder I'm not an alcoholic.
OTHERMALE:What I meant was, how about working for me? I'm swamped with this project for Enrique Mas, and there is money for an assistant.
LEADMALE:Tell me more.
SUPMALE:Well, we're compiling statistics on supplemental healthcare for seniors.
LEADMALE:Some companies are preying on fear and then using loopholes to avoid paying claims.
SUPFEMALE:For someone on fixed income, it's a matter of life and death.
LEADMALE:By "Tell me more," I mean, "Does it pay $300?" Well, I suppose that'd be OK.
LEADMALE:But I can't believe, with something this important, that you are still so self-centered.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Count me in.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, can you drive me to the mall Friday night? They're giving free blood pressure tests, and some of the girls and I have a high-low bet.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, honey, don't you remember? Friday night we're planning on having dinner at Joe's Stone Crab.
LEADMALE:Oh? It's your wedding anniversary.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, right.
LEADMALE:Sounds nice.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, you didn't forget, did you? Oh, forgive me, I forgot something.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you should ship me back to Shady Pines.
LEADMALE:Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be in the living room being feeble.
LEADMALE:If I can find the living room!  Dorothy, what just happened? Well, weren't you listening? Sophia came in and asked Dorothy to drive her to the mall for a blood pressure test.
LEADMALE:And then Dorothy told Sophia that they had a date to go out to dinner Friday night, and then Sophia said Would you hand me the newspaper? Oh.
LEADMALE:No, the "Metro" section.
SUPMALE:that she and the girls Hey, don't kill the messenger.
LEADMALE: It's Ma.
LEADMALE:She's becoming more forgetful.
LEADMALE:And she denies it and she gets mad.
LEADMALE:How bad is it? Bad.
SUPFEMALE:It's not just a matter of small things anymore.
LEADMALE:I can't believe she forgot this dinner.
OTHERMALE:I mean, every year since my father died, I've been taking her out to dinner on her wedding anniversary, because she's lonely.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you'd better talk to her doctor about this.
LEADMALE:You're right, Blanche.
SUPMALE:I guess I've just been hoping that things would improve by themselves.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I never thought Ma would lose her memory.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, I never thought Alan Alda would get on my nerves.
LEADMALE:Ma, can we talk for a minute? I'm going through the family album.
OTHERMALE:I thought I'd pay your father a visit.
LEADFEMALE:Look, here we all are! Your sweet sixteen party, right? Right! Look at that beautiful chiffon dress.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, your brother Phil always did like to make a splash.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, look! The Jersey shore, summer 1939.
LEADMALE:Pop sure loved playing with you kids.
LEADFEMALE:Why do I look so upset? Oh, Ma, don't you remember? Pop was a big fan of Jean Harlow's back then.
OTHERFEMALE:You hated it when he made sand breasts in front of the children.
LEADMALE: He was really some character.
LEADMALE:Oh, look at us.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy, your father sure looked stupid.
LEADMALE:Stupid? Ma, this was one of your favorite pictures.
LEADMALE:Oh, Pop looks so proud.
LEADFEMALE:The idiot's dressed like an organ grinder.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Yes, he is.
OTHERMALE:Remember, we had no money, and he refused to go on assistance.
LEADFEMALE:He vowed that he would take any job to feed his family.
LEADMALE:And we had meat on the table every night.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know he did it on 10 cents a day.
OTHERMALE:Where's the monkey? Oh, look, there you are, stirring sauce.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, my old kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:And there are the potholders Grandma made, your pasta maker.
LEADMALE:Ah, the pantry.
LEADFEMALE:Remember what Pop kept behind the pantry door? Yeah, he carved a giant heart there that said "Sal loves Sophia.
OTHERFEMALE:" No, Ma, it was our height measurements.
SUPFEMALE:He kept track of them on the back of the pantry door.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, that was my kitchen, that was my Sal, and he put the heart there because he loved me.
LEADFEMALE:That I remember! I'm sure you do.
OTHERMALE:Listen, Ma why don't we talk to your doctor and see what he has to say, hmm? Yeah, well maybe.
SUPMALE:I don't remember half these photos.
LEADMALE:I don't remember Brooklyn.
LEADMALE:I don't even remember you going off to your senior prom.
LEADMALE:Ma, I never went to my senior prom.
LEADMALE:Actually, I did remember that, but why should I be the only one here to feel like crap? Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I thought you were gonna be working.
LEADMALE:You don't think playing three sets of tennis in this heat is work? When are you gonna get the survey done? Rose, let me explain something.
LEADFEMALE:Now, in this world, there are two kinds of people.
LEADMALE:One is an industrious, hardworking, give 100%, pain-in-the-butt-to- everybody-else go-getter.
LEADFEMALE:I am not one of those people.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, I wish I felt better about this.
LEADMALE:Well, I wish you did, too.
LEADMALE:Sophia, Dorothy, how did it go at the doctor's? It was great.
LEADMALE:He said that Ma's memory problem could be related to a nutritional imbalance, so he put her on a special diet, and if she follows it, she'll be fine from here on out.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, lucky me, I can remember from now on.
LEADMALE:My whole past is gone! I could have slept with JFK and don't even know it! Ma, I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:You're not mentioned in any of the books.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that doesn't necessarily mean anything.
SUPMALE:Ma, come on, now.
LEADMALE:He also said that there are things that you can do that might bring back some of what you've lost.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we could talk about the good old days, reminisce with old friends.
SUPMALE:Honey, you have to look on the bright side.
OTHERFEMALE:I've had a lifetime of bright sides.
LEADMALE:I'll just have to learn to do without them.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dammit.
LEADMALE:I hate watching what this is doing to her.
LEADMALE:I hate watching what it's doing to you.
OTHERMALE:I hate watching those FBI warnings at the beginning of video rentals.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hello, sir.
LEADFEMALE:I am conducting a phone survey regarding healthcare for the elderly.
SUPFEMALE:May I ask your age? That's not so old! And what's your general health? That's good.
LEADFEMALE:What would you say is your annual income? Oh, that's very good! Marital status? Oh, I am sorry.
SUPFEMALE:How long? Three weeks! I'd say it was time you were getting on with your life, honey.
LEADMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, marital status is not a question on the survey.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm sorry, Rose, but I ask a man 20 questions, you can bet your life one of 'em's gonna be, "Are you married?" I can't believe it! Haven't you done anything? Of course I have.
SUPFEMALE:Do you see this big stack right here? Well, just behind it is what I have done.
OTHERFEMALE:It's only one survey, but I'm very proud of it.
LEADFEMALE:I should've known this was gonna happen.
SUPFEMALE:You should never work with friends.
LEADMALE:You're fired.
SUPFEMALE:You can't fire me.
LEADMALE:That's against the law
LEADMALE:that's sex discrimination.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll give you one more chance.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute! How is it sex discrimination? That's what I was doing this afternoon when I didn't get this work done.
SUPFEMALE:How's Sophia? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Today's her anniversary.
LEADFEMALE:She won't come out of her room.
LEADFEMALE:I've never seen her like this.
OTHERMALE:She is really depressed.
SUPMALE:Adios! Everybody wave goodbye! I'm off to Brooklyn! Honey, what are you doing? I'm going back to the old neighborhood.
LEADFEMALE:The doctor said it would help if I stirred up some memories.
SUPMALE:Ma, you can't go back there alone! No kidding.
SUPMALE:I'm 83.
OTHERFEMALE:I walk to the driveway, it's a coin toss whether I get back.
LEADFEMALE:You're coming with me.
LEADMALE:I am? What the hell? You paid! Look, I can deal with losing some of my memory.
LEADMALE:If I didn't have to remember what's-her-name over here, I wouldn't care.
OTHERMALE:But Sal was the most important person in my life, and scrapbooks aren't doing the trick.
LEADMALE:OK, Ma, if this is what you really want to do It's not what I want to do, it's what I have to do.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, today is my anniversary, and I barely remember getting married.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I hate getting old.
SUPMALE:You always seem to be losing something.
SUPFEMALE:First it's your eyesight.
LEADFEMALE:Then people are telling you to turn down the TV set when you can barely hear it.
SUPMALE:And you could live with that.
LEADMALE:But this? They're trying to take something from me that I just won't give.
LEADMALE:I can't let this happen, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I can't lose my Sal.
LEADFEMALE:Not again.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't it good to be back in the old neighborhood, Dorothy? Watching the kids playing stickball on the corner? Ma, they were beating a man.
LEADMALE:That was sort of why I called the police.
LEADMALE:Ah, they were just having a good time.
LEADMALE: Now, look, Ma, I don't want you to be disappointed if the new tenants don't let us in.
LEADFEMALE:Buenos dÃ­as.
LEADMALE:Oh, God! I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
LEADMALE:This is my mother, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Petrillo.
SUPMALE:I know this is going to sound odd, but we used to live here many, many years ago, and we were hoping that we could look around
LEADFEMALE:you know, for old times' sake.
LEADMALE:Would that be possible? Petrillo? They let Italians live here?! Look, we came all the way from Miami.
SUPFEMALE:Please? OK.
SUPMALE:But don't take anything.
LEADFEMALE:I'm meeting my family, so I can only give you a little while.
LEADFEMALE:We appreciate it very much.
LEADMALE:You see, my mother is having a memory problem.
LEADFEMALE:We were hoping that if we looked around the apartment There's no need to explain.
SUPFEMALE:I have an elderly mother myself.
SUPMALE:Oh, One more thing.
SUPFEMALE:Yes? Don't take anything.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, look
LEADMALE:my old wallpaper.
LEADMALE:Oh, God, it feels the same.
LEADFEMALE:And that big old window I used to look out of.
SUPMALE:Oh, Ma, I remember when I was a little girl playing out in the street.
OTHERFEMALE:I can still hear your voice.
OTHERMALE:"Dorothy, fix your dress
LEADMALE:the whole neighborhood can see your business.
SUPFEMALE:" Sounds like me.
LEADMALE:Ma, we don't have too much time.
OTHERMALE:OK, let's get in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:I want to show you that heart your father carved for me and prove to you I'm not totally crazy.
LEADMALE:Ma, remember, it's only a carving.
SUPMALE:Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
LEADMALE:Hey, I may be fading, but that's the sweetest thing that man ever did for me.
LEADMALE:I know that heart's behind the door.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe it! They must have sanded it off.
SUPMALE:No, Ma.
SUPMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:See, Ma, it's our height chart.
LEADMALE:You can see it through the paint.
SUPMALE:See? Here's Phil, Gloria, me.
SUPFEMALE:I could have sworn I would have bet my life on it.
SUPMALE:Oh, Ma, there are so many memories in this apartment.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be so down.
SUPMALE:You remember the day you brought Phil back from the hospital? I was a little upset, because that was the day Pop usually took me to the zoo.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it was the racetrack, but he called it the zoo.
SUPMALE:You kept Phil in this room because it was the warmest room.
LEADFEMALE:And I guess I was a little starved for attention, because I remember Oh, Salvadore, isn't he beautiful? A piece of art.
SUPMALE:But what do you have him in Dorothy's hand-me-downs for? So he wears girls' clothes for a while
LEADMALE:what's it gonna hurt? Dorothy! Sal, do something about your daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, come over here.
OTHERMALE:We know you're upset about the new baby, but we need for you to be a big girl.
LEADMALE:Your mother's had a rough week.
LEADMALE:First I'm called away, and then the baby's delivered by a cabby.
LEADFEMALE:Cesarean! Now I know you think Phil here's taken your place.
LEADMALE:Well, I wanna tell you something.
LEADMALE:I love you more than anything.
OTHERFEMALE:Even more than the Dodgers on five-cent beer night? OK, even more than that.
LEADFEMALE:Wow! Daddy, I love you.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, too, kiddo.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, let's go to the zoo.
LEADMALE:I got a tip on a giraffe in the sixth race.
SUPMALE:Heh heh! Pop sure taught me a lot about sibling rivalry that day.
LEADFEMALE:When we got home I went right over to the baby and said, "I love you, Phil.
LEADFEMALE:" No, wait.
LEADFEMALE:I wrote it on him.
OTHERFEMALE:Here you go, Rose.
LEADMALE:Finished my work.
LEADMALE:Well, turn me upside down and paint me blue! Well, give me my money.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm sorry we fought the way we did, but this work for senior healthcare is very important to me, and I was hoping it would be to you, too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it wasn't, but it is now.
LEADMALE:It is? How could I help it? After I looked through the paperwork, I realized how expensive healthcare is for the elderly.
SUPFEMALE:You know, some folks have lost their life savings.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, people ought to write their congressman or something.
LEADMALE:In fact, I am so touched, when you cut my check, don't make it out to me.
LEADMALE:That's beautiful, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Make it out to "Hair by Robert.
SUPMALE:" I'm not gonna declare it as income and let those lazy congressmen have my tax dollars! Blanche, I don't wanna do that.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, all right, just pay me under the table.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sure! I know that trick.
LEADMALE:Dorothy's done that to me before.
LEADMALE:I go under the table and you never show up.
OTHERMALE:No way! Boy, this room is sure alive with memories.
LEADFEMALE:Those were good days.
SUPFEMALE:I think I'll go up to the bedroom.
OTHERMALE:Sal and I spent our most intimate moments there.
LEADFEMALE:Ma Ma, is there anything I can do for you? Yeah, stay out.
LEADMALE:You barged in on me enough when you were a kid.
OTHERFEMALE:Sally, what's going on? What's wrong with me? You think you got problems? Try being dead.
SUPFEMALE:Heh heh.
OTHERFEMALE:Sal! What the hell are you doing here? Relax.
LEADMALE:I'm not really here.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just a Fig Newton of your imagination.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Sal, it's been so long, I've forgotten how much you used to like Norm Crosby.
LEADFEMALE:So, how are things? "How are things?"! Sal, talk to me.
SUPMALE:How are you? What's new? What's heaven like? You know, everyone thinks heaven is right above.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, it's a little more to the left.
SUPFEMALE:What's God like? Nice.
OTHERFEMALE:You should see his car! Oh, before I forget, Gladys says hello.
LEADMALE:You fooling around with Gladys? Of course not.
LEADFEMALE:Gladys is going out with Charlemagne.
OTHERFEMALE:Sophia, I see from upstairs you've kind of lost your spunk.
SUPMALE:What's the matter? I'm slipping, Sal, and it's frightening.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm even forgetting you, forgetting the good old days.
SUPFEMALE:And what, I'm supposed to feel sorry for you? That'd be a start! Nah, the Sophia I know is a survivor.
LEADFEMALE:That's why we got married.
LEADMALE:You beat out a lot of other women.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, there was a helluva long line waiting to get to you, Sal! What's the name of that girl with the warts? You see? Some things you do remember.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but only some things.
SUPMALE:I'm 83, Sal.
SUPMALE:I don't have the energy for this.
LEADFEMALE:You have lost your spunk.
LEADFEMALE:You know, maybe I don't find you so attractive anymore.
LEADMALE:What?! You're not the same Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:I wonder how Gladys and Charlemagne are doing.
LEADMALE:Sure, the guy rewrote history, but can he juggle? Salvadore Petrillo, you miserable botchagaloop! If you so much as look at another ghost See? There's the spunk.
LEADFEMALE:It's still there.
LEADFEMALE:But use it for yourself, not on me.
LEADMALE:You think I can be OK? If I didn't, would I have made the trip? I miss you, Sally.
LEADMALE:Hey, I'm always with you.
SUPFEMALE:And when the time's right, see you at my place.
SUPMALE:Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Hernandez has to go.
LEADMALE:I'm meeting the wife and kids.
SUPFEMALE:We are going ice-skating.
LEADMALE:Dorothy! Oh, my God! Can you believe it? Hey, Puerto Ricans can ice-skate! Jeez! Dorothy! Dorothy, look! It's the carving.
LEADMALE:See? "Sal loves Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:" Oh, Ma! You're Sophia? That's right.
LEADMALE:And I remembered.
SUPMALE:I mixed up the rooms, but I remembered.
SUPMALE:Of course.
SUPMALE:I thought the carving was in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Sal used to hang his salamis in here.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, I may be fading, but I'm still holding on to some of the big things.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and you might get more back.
SUPFEMALE:"Might"? I insist! All I need is a little more spunk.
LEADFEMALE:Imagine finding that carving in here! Kitchen, bedroom
LEADMALE:I knew it was a room I was good in!
SUPFEMALE:
