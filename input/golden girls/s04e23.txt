OTHERMALE:Hi, Ma.
LEADMALE:What are you eating? Ziti.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, it's nine o'clock in the morning.
SUPFEMALE:You're eating a bowl of pasta? No, I'm eating a bowl of Nabisco Zitios.
SUPFEMALE:Of course I'm eating pasta.
OTHERFEMALE:I need to gain weight.
SUPFEMALE:I'm wasting away, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? I got weighed this morning.
LEADMALE:I couldn't believe what I saw.
LEADFEMALE:98lbs.
LEADFEMALE:What do you usually weigh? Ma, you lost one pound.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, RenÃ© Descartes.
LEADMALE:I'm looking for advice, not arithmetic.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you cannot get upset over one pound.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you can't.
LEADMALE:I can.
SUPMALE:For 50 years my weight hasn't changed by an ounce, and as far as I'm concerned, until I'm back to 99, I'm no longer Sophia Petrillo.
OTHERMALE:Morning, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Morning, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Who? Dorothy, do you realize it's only two weeks till Phyllis's Memorial Day beach party? There's only two weeks till we have to get back into bathing suits again.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I just slipped into last year's bikini and I think I look pretty good, but you give me your honest advice.
SUPMALE:Can I still pull it off? Right now I'd be surprised if you could cut if off.
LEADMALE:Are you implying that I might have gained weight? There's only one way to find out.
SUPFEMALE:Here's the scale.
LEADMALE:Oh, fine.
OTHERFEMALE: Whoa! Sophia, were you looking? Uh, no, not till you stepped off.
LEADFEMALE:But I know it's not a good sign when the first rebound goes into the low 120s.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, honey, don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:All you need is a little spring tune-up.
LEADFEMALE:And I suppose you don't? No, not really.
SUPMALE:Prove it.
LEADMALE:Put your money where your mouth is.
LEADFEMALE:If there isn't already a sweet roll there.
LEADMALE:All right, all right, but, now, nobody look.
OTHERMALE:I always thought you had to pass zero to hit that number.
LEADFEMALE:Obviously the scale is broken.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not surprised after that kind of punishment.
OTHERMALE:Rose, you think you're so tiny, why don't you get weighed? Oh, I don't need to.
LEADMALE:I never gain weight.
LEADFEMALE:Show us, Rose.
LEADMALE:Well, OK, but I can promise you I weigh exactly the same as I did on my wedding day.
LEADFEMALE: Moo! Obviously we all need to lose a few pounds.
OTHERFEMALE:We might as well start right now.
SUPMALE:It's still two weeks until Phyllis's party.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, but how? We could try another health club.
LEADMALE:Oh, no way, Rose.
LEADMALE:I'm sure you haven't forgotten what happened that time we tried that.
LEADMALE:Remember the outfits we ended up with? Oh, Lord have mercy.
LEADMALE:This seems like a nice club.
LEADMALE:But it's for women only.
SUPMALE:What's wrong with the nice coed gym we just saw? Come on now, Blanche, that was nothing but a pickup scene.
LEADFEMALE:People running around in skimpy outfits, collecting phone numbers.
SUPMALE:That's not true.
LEADFEMALE:I was not in a skimpy outfit and I got all these.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:My name is Yvonne.
SUPFEMALE:Have you been here before? See? You go to a woman's gym, you get hit on by a woman.
LEADMALE:I work here.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I didn't mean to imply anything.
LEADFEMALE:She just thought you were a lesbian.
LEADMALE:Yvonne, we want to join a gym.
OTHERMALE:What kind of exercise are you interested in? Nothing radical, just to lose a few pounds Tone up.
SUPMALE:Slim down.
SUPFEMALE:Get into my summer wardrobe.
LEADFEMALE:Get into my winter wardrobe.
SUPFEMALE:Get into my bathrobe.
OTHERMALE:Yvonne, we are desperate women.
OTHERFEMALE:You've got to help us.
OTHERFEMALE:I know just what you need.
OTHERMALE:Aerobics.
SUPFEMALE:It's what I do.
LEADMALE:But, Yvonne, you're much younger than they are.
LEADFEMALE:I know you'll love aerobics.
OTHERMALE:It stretches every muscle in your body.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, I've been stretching this body for years.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, sticking your feet out of the sunroof of a Chrysler New Yorker doesn't count.
LEADFEMALE:We have a beginners' class starting in 15 minutes.
SUPFEMALE:With some hard work, your body can look as good as mine.
OTHERMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:We better get you some outfits.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's OK.
LEADFEMALE:We brought our sweats.
OTHERFEMALE:Sweats? Look, ladies, if you're serious about training, you want to get off on the right foot, starting with good workout shoes.
SUPFEMALE:Now, these are beautiful, and a bargain at $85.
LEADMALE:$85? That's a bit exorbitant.
LEADMALE:And expensive too.
LEADFEMALE:We do have cheaper brands, but anyone who's serious wouldn't even go near them.
LEADMALE:Then we'll take those.
LEADMALE:Fine.
OTHERMALE:You'll also need aerobic suits, warmup outfits, wristbands, headbands, leg warmers.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Leg warmers? You need to keep your thighs warm.
LEADMALE:What are you using now? Friction.
OTHERMALE:That's why we're here.
LEADFEMALE:Ladies, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:When you told me you were serious, I took you literally.
LEADMALE:Just forget this stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Wear your sweats.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, Yvonne.
LEADMALE:We want all that stuff.
LEADFEMALE:We do.
SUPFEMALE:We really do.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna stick with my sweat suit and my PF Flyers.
LEADMALE:I'll see you girls in the locker room.
LEADMALE:Yvonne, she's not serious.
LEADMALE:Never has been, never will be.
LEADMALE:OK, then you'll need new gym bags, water bottles, vitamin packs, and most importantly, a sports training bra to minimize jiggle and bounce.
LEADMALE:Yvonne, honey, I think you're missing the whole point of having breasts.
SUPMALE:We'll take them.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
OTHERMALE:Nice outfits, girls.
SUPMALE:Shut up, Rose.
LEADMALE:I'm Yvonne and this is it! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo.
OTHERMALE:OK, everybody, let's warm up.
LEADMALE:Whoo! Whoo! And stretch.
SUPFEMALE:Legs wider.
LEADMALE:Oh, ow.
LEADMALE:That hurts.
LEADMALE:I'm not having any trouble.
LEADMALE:Why is it that doesn't surprise me? OK, everybody on their feet.
OTHERMALE: Whirlybirds.
LEADMALE:Whirlybirds.
LEADMALE:Jackhammer.
LEADFEMALE:Jackhammer.
LEADFEMALE:Windshield wipers.
LEADMALE:Windshield wipers.
LEADMALE:Charley horse.
LEADMALE:Charley horse.
SUPMALE:She has a cramp, you pea brain.
SUPMALE:All that money and we only went twice.
LEADMALE:Can you believe it? What are you cooking now, Ma? A Petrillo family delicacy.
SUPFEMALE:Double-fudge, amaretto, ricotta cheesecake.
SUPFEMALE:What's in it? This cake is guaranteed to make me gain back that pound.
LEADMALE:Ma, all this eating you're doing is ridiculous.
LEADMALE:Now, I am sure you are already back up to 99lbs.
LEADFEMALE:We'll see.
LEADFEMALE:Wrong again, Kreskin.
SUPMALE:Still 98.
SUPMALE:I can't remember the last time I weighed 98.
LEADFEMALE:Probably college.
OTHERFEMALE:Where'd you go to college, Blanche? The University of Jupiter? Girls, we still have one big problem to solve.
OTHERFEMALE:How are we gonna make ourselves look good for the party? How else, Rose? By dieting.
LEADFEMALE:It's gonna take a little patience and a little determination, but mostly it's gonna take willpower.
OTHERMALE:We are facing some long, painful, hunger pang filled nights.
SUPFEMALE:Who wants to lick the spoon? I do.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we could just change our hairdos.
LEADMALE:Now, we cannot do that, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm still trying to recover from the last time.
LEADMALE:Remember, about the same time of year
LEADFEMALE:two years ago, was it? That little dinky place.
LEADMALE:Gee, Ma, I don't know if this was such a good idea.
OTHERFEMALE:I think you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I should've done my own hair.
LEADMALE:I've been doing it for years.
LEADFEMALE:That's why it looks like something you buy on a stick at halftime.
LEADMALE:Sophia, we're just a little bit nervous.
LEADFEMALE:This is a very important event.
SUPMALE:We want to look perfect.
LEADFEMALE:Please! The man works with scissors, not a sandblaster.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, this is all a mistake.
LEADMALE:We don't belong here.
LEADMALE:This is one of those Miami Beach shops for little old ladies.
LEADMALE:Come on, let's get out of her All right, ladies.
SUPFEMALE:Whose hair do I wash next? Mine.
LEADMALE:I'm first.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the dirtiest.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, God, you are gorgeous.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, I know.
LEADFEMALE:I am Eduardo.
SUPFEMALE:Eduardo, tonight is important to us.
LEADMALE:We want to look our best.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, ladies.
LEADMALE:After Eduardo does a woman's hair, the years melt away.
LEADMALE:She's transformed into a breathtaking, sensuous, vivacious goddess of beauty.
SUPMALE:I tried to get all that on the sign, but they charge by the letter.
LEADFEMALE:We should begin by your telling me what you would like.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
SUPFEMALE:I have a picture.
LEADMALE:This is not you.
LEADMALE:You are a vixen.
OTHERFEMALE:For you, I see a saucier cut.
SUPMALE:An Audrey Hepburn look.
SUPFEMALE:Simple, elegant, and something to accent these delicate features.
LEADFEMALE:Can you really do all that? My dear, in many respects, styling hair is like making love.
LEADMALE:To do it well, one must have trust, respect and a chair you can pump up and down.
LEADFEMALE:I am your clay.
LEADMALE:Mold me.
SUPFEMALE:Not so fast, Eduardo.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you going to do with me? You have good bones.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, this is a strong, noble face, full of wisdom and sincerity.
SUPMALE:You could be a Greek goddess.
LEADFEMALE:Go on, Eduardo.
OTHERMALE:I said go on, Eduardo.
LEADFEMALE:Give him a break.
SUPMALE:He barely got it out once with a straight face.
LEADMALE:What about me? Could I be a goddess too? No, no.
LEADMALE:You are an earth mother.
LEADFEMALE:Sweet, compassionate, but bubbling with sensuality just below the surface.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's a relief.
LEADFEMALE:All this time I thought it was gas.
SUPFEMALE:Ladies, it's time.
LEADMALE:Time to walk through the looking glass.
LEADMALE:Time to take that last glimpse of your former selves.
LEADMALE:Time to take that giant step into the world of Eduardoism.
LEADFEMALE:You've been drinking again, haven't you? Right.
SUPMALE:The magic begins.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I'm feeling younger and sexier already.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, how do I look? Like something that came out of the air duct of the starship Enterprise.
SUPFEMALE:What? What? Ladies, it's time.
LEADMALE:Time for the unveiling of another Eduardo masterpiece.
LEADMALE:Sit back, feast your eyes, and meet the woman you always dreamt you could be.
LEADMALE:Eduardo, you've done it again.
LEADFEMALE:And again.
LEADFEMALE:And again.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, I still cannot believe you talked us into that.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:You three looked gorgeous.
SUPFEMALE:We didn't even look like ourselves.
SUPMALE:What's your point? Ma, you are not helping matters.
LEADMALE:We are trying to think of a way we can make ourselves look better for that party.
LEADMALE:OK, let me think.
LEADFEMALE:It's too bad we're not back home.
SUPFEMALE:There's no place like Sicily.
OTHERFEMALE:Why do you say that, Sophia? Because in Sicily I could solve this with one phone call.
LEADMALE:To whom? Nicodemo the Ugly.
LEADMALE:Whenever you wanted to look gorgeous at a party, you hired him to be your date.
OTHERMALE:You mean women paid him to stand next to them at parties and look disgusting? Please.
OTHERMALE:They paid through the nose.
SUPFEMALE:That's also how he usually gave them their change.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, maybe we don't even need to worry about our bodies.
SUPMALE:At the counseling center, we teach people that changing their dispositions can sometimes be just as effective in making a good impression.
SUPMALE:Rose, if you're thinking of one of those personality-enhancing exercises, you're forgetting we tried that already once too.
SUPFEMALE:And I'll never try that again.
LEADMALE:Remember? Three years ago.
LEADFEMALE:It seems like yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:Damn! What's the matter, Pussycat? I can't balance my checkbook.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, to hell with it.
SUPMALE:I'm only off by a few pennies.
LEADMALE:A few pennies.
SUPMALE:To you it may not be much, but in Sicily a few pennies could make the difference between owning a gun and having to insert bullets into your victim manually.
SUPMALE:OK, Ma, I'll try it again, but believe me,  there's nothing in this world I hate more.
LEADMALE:I spoke too soon.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, babe.
LEADFEMALE:It's me, Stan.
LEADMALE:Wait, let me rephrase that.
SUPMALE:It's me, the new Stan.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talking about? Don't you notice a difference? Can't you see the glow? Can't you see the light radiating off me? Sure.
LEADMALE:It's the porch light glaring off your head.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I heard a man's voi Oh, it's you, Stan.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so happy you're all here.
SUPFEMALE:I have just had an incredible experience that I wanted to share with my dearest friends.
SUPFEMALE:So what are you doing here? I just finished a seminar with an encounter group called Realizations.
LEADFEMALE:Realizations.
LEADMALE:Let me guess.
OTHERMALE:It's a group that promises to remove all emotional blocks, self-denial and lifelong hang-ups in two days.
SUPFEMALE:Miss Know-It-All, for your information it takes three days.
LEADMALE:So what did it do for you? I've learned a hell of a lot about what makes Stanley run.
SUPFEMALE:Why I'm so reluctant to make commitments, why I can't keep friends, why all my business ventures seem to fail.
LEADMALE:I finally have an answer.
LEADMALE:Because you're a schmuck? Did you take this seminar? Stan, I think we've heard enough.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I've gone through a life-changing experience.
LEADMALE:I feel like I'm free to love anybody.
LEADMALE:Oh, please.
OTHERFEMALE:You said the same thing after you had your vasectomy.
SUPMALE:That's OK.
LEADMALE:In Realizations, I learnt that people usually hurt each other unintentionally, therefore they deserve a second chance.
SUPFEMALE:I hate you.
LEADMALE:Nothing can bother me.
LEADMALE:Not now.
SUPFEMALE:I'm in a fellowship that accepts me, cares for me and loves me.
SUPFEMALE:They'll always be there for me, and I'd like to enroll all of you in that fellowship.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:But you've got to.
SUPMALE:Why? Because if I don't meet my quota for enrolling new people in this loving, accepting, caring fellowship, they're gonna kick me out on the street and never speak to me again.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:At least hear me out.
LEADMALE:All right, Stanley.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll listen to what you have to say.
LEADFEMALE:Beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:How about we all go someplace and get comfortable, get some coffee, have something to eat? I'll go change.
LEADMALE:Why? We're only going into the kitchen.
LEADMALE:Boy, I hope you have some cheesecake.
LEADMALE:Stan, that's it.
LEADMALE:I've had it with your freeloading.
LEADFEMALE:Get out.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, you have so much hostility, so much aggression, so much mistrust.
LEADFEMALE:This problem goes deeper than I thought.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna need a steak with that cheesecake.
LEADMALE:Get out! Dorothy Out! I'll just leave you the brochure.
SUPFEMALE:Can you believe that man? He actually thought he was gonna help us.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he did have one good idea.
LEADFEMALE:What was that? Cheesecake.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Dorothy, to this day I cannot understand what you saw in that man.
OTHERFEMALE:Picture a man 20lbs lighter, long, wavy hair, rippling muscles.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe Stan looked like that.
SUPMALE:He didn't.
OTHERMALE:Do you think if I ever met a man who looked like that, I would've married Stan? Maybe we shouldn't be so tough on the guy.
OTHERFEMALE:This brochure actually looks interesting, once you get past the picture of the guy in the turban waving from the front seat of the Rolls-Royce.
LEADMALE:Sophia, those things are just silly.
LEADMALE:"The unexamined life is a life not worth living.
LEADFEMALE:" That's very deep.
SUPFEMALE:And if you're into this, very reasonable.
SUPFEMALE:It's 17.
LEADFEMALE:95 for that slogan printed on a turban-shaped night-light.
LEADMALE:Oh, that is so typical.
OTHERFEMALE:All those swamis are just out for a buck.
SUPMALE:They can't teach you anything that anyone with any common sense doesn't already know.
LEADMALE:I didn't know that.
OTHERFEMALE:A visual aid.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really, Ramdas? If it's all so easy, let's hear you answer this question.
SUPFEMALE:"Describe your best friend.
LEADMALE:" Dorothy, that's a really good question.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes, and I'd love to hear the answer.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, my best friend is a woman, someone I have a great deal in common with.
LEADFEMALE:Is she pretty? Yes, she's attractive.
LEADFEMALE:Attractive as in wholesome? Or attractive as in drop-dead stunningly gorgeous? Attractive as in attractive.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:What else? She's someone I share my innermost secrets with in strictest confidence.
LEADMALE:You mean like the time you told me you borrowed Blanche's car, dented it, and said the bag boy at the grocery store did it? That's not a secret.
LEADMALE:I just forgot to mention it.
LEADFEMALE:I think she means more like the time she told me that she went skinny-dipping with your cousin Lars before he gave up the pulpit back in St.
LEADFEMALE:Gustave.
LEADFEMALE:That's a better example of a secret.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, then you have been talking about me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm your best friend.
LEADMALE:She's been talking about me, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:I haven't been talking about either one of you.
LEADMALE:What? I've been talking about both of you.
OTHERMALE:I mean, how could I chose between you two? You're both my best friends.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, how sweet.
LEADMALE:Oh, that just gives me a warm, tingly feeling all over.
SUPFEMALE:If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go slip under the covers and enjoy it.
LEADMALE:OK, Dorothy, she's gone.
LEADFEMALE:You can tell me the truth.
OTHERMALE:You were talking about me, weren't you? That's OK.
SUPFEMALE:It'll be our own little secret.
OTHERMALE:That, and the dent in Blanche's car.
SUPMALE:Got you.
LEADMALE:You are such a liar.
LEADMALE:What? Neither of them is your best friend.
LEADFEMALE:Admit it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm your best friend.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:I was talking about you, Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:You are my best friend.
SUPFEMALE:Just like I'm your best friend.
LEADMALE:Best friend? Please.
LEADMALE:You aren't even my favorite child.
SUPMALE:When you were 13, there were neighbor children I liked better.
LEADFEMALE:Best friend.
LEADFEMALE:How about picking up a tab once in a while, pal of mine? Or letting me open my own social security check? Best friend! Yeah, right.
SUPFEMALE:That little exercise certainly did not enhance things around here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I wouldn't say that.
LEADMALE:After Ma blabbed the truth, you turned the silent treatment into an art form.
SUPFEMALE: Oh, there's my cake.
SUPMALE:Oh, Ma.
LEADMALE:Now, you cannot eat cake after that big bowl of pasta.
LEADFEMALE:It's not healthy.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, I just thought of something.
LEADMALE:You're worried about losing a pound.
LEADFEMALE:Have you ever thought you may not be the same height you always were? You know, Ma, Blanche could be right.
LEADMALE:This could be exactly why you're losing weight.
LEADMALE:Come with me.
LEADFEMALE:Remember the first week you were here, we put a mark on the back wall to measure how tall we were? You said they did that at the home to show how your height was declining.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Blanche is right.
OTHERMALE:You are a little bit shorter.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to worry about losing weight.
LEADMALE:And you don't have to eat that cake.
OTHERMALE:Why do I get the feeling you three are most happy about the last part? Oh, you mean us have some cake? Honey, we can't do that.
SUPMALE:We're dieting.
LEADMALE:Sure smells good though.
SUPMALE:Looks even better.
LEADMALE:Bet you it tastes even better than that.
LEADFEMALE:You three are dieting.
LEADFEMALE:I'm throwing it away.
SUPMALE:Don't! Oh, girls, we can't do this.
SUPMALE:Now, remember the party.
LEADFEMALE:It's two weeks from Saturday.
LEADMALE:No, it isn't.
SUPMALE:This year Phyllis moved it to Sunday.
LEADFEMALE:Then we have an extra day.
OTHERMALE:We can worry about our bodies tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get the plates.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get the forks.
LEADMALE:I'll get the hot fudge.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get the butter.
LEADMALE:We may have to grease the doorway to get the three of you out of here.
SUPMALE:
