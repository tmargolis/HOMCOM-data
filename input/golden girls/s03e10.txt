LEADFEMALE:Hi, Ma.
SUPMALE:Oh, something smells terrific.
LEADFEMALE:What is it? Spaghetti sauce.
LEADMALE:Here, have a taste.
SUPFEMALE:Mmm.
SUPMALE:Delicious.
SUPMALE:Delicious? This is the reason your father and I got married.
OTHERMALE:Girls, do you realize it has been eight days since I've had a date? Do you realize it's been eight days since I had Ma, please.
LEADMALE:Whatever it is, keep it to yourself.
LEADFEMALE:That's my problem.
LEADFEMALE:I don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't seem to be able to attract as many men as I used to.
LEADMALE:Maybe it's just the beginning of the end.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe I'll never have another date again, as long as I live.
LEADMALE:Don't be ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:Not you, Blanche.
SUPMALE: You're right.
LEADMALE:I am being ridiculous.
SUPMALE:If anybody never has another date, it'll probably be you.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:I feel so much better.
OTHERMALE: Hi, girls.
LEADMALE:Guess what I'll be doing for three hours every Tuesday and Thursday night? Cutting up your black pantyhose and putting on an Amos 'n Andy puppet show? No, but what a great idea.
SUPFEMALE:Terrific, now you have something to do on Wednesdays.
SUPMALE:Okey-dokey.
LEADMALE:Do you know that promotion I was up for at the counseling center? Well, I found out I can't have it unless I become bilingual.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, honey, don't do that.
LEADFEMALE:No job is worth having to date women.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, "bilingual" refers to a person who speaks more than one language.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Why'd I think it was something sexual? That's why I signed up for a Spanish class at night school.
LEADMALE:That's a wonderful idea.
SUPFEMALE:Men go to night school.
SUPMALE:Smart men.
SUPFEMALE:And nothing turns me on more than a smart man.
LEADMALE:Unless maybe it's a stupid man with good hands.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, count me in.
LEADFEMALE:Dinner's ready.
SUPFEMALE:What are we having?
LEADMALE: Spaghetti.
LEADMALE:Italian food? No, Rose, actually it's Chinese food.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:I'll get it.
LEADMALE: Now that I'm taking Spanish, I'm gonna totally immerse myself in the culture.
OTHERFEMALE:From now on, I'm only speaking Spanish.
SUPFEMALE:I'm eating Spanish food, I'm wearing Spanish clothes, and I'm re-reading the covers of my Julio Iglesias albums really, really carefully.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, Stan's here to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, everybody.
OTHERMALE: Sorry to barge in on your meal.
LEADFEMALE:It's all right.
LEADMALE:Would you like some spaghetti?
SUPMALE:It's delicious.
LEADMALE:Did you make it?
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I'd love some.
SUPFEMALE:Are you here for a reason or did you come for free food? Ma, please, the man is a guest in our home.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell do you want, Stanley? Well, it seems the IRS found a few discrepancies in my tax returns.
LEADMALE:So I think we may have a slight problem.
OTHERFEMALE:Stanley, we have not been together for a long time.
LEADFEMALE:Your tax return is your problem.
SUPMALE:Not exactly.
LEADFEMALE:They've decided to go over the returns for the last few years, and a few years ago, we were married.
LEADMALE:Babe, I'm afraid we're being audited.
LEADFEMALE:What?
LEADMALE:He said, "Babe, I'm afraid"
LEADMALE:I heard him, Rose! Just relax, Dorothy, sometimes they just randomly audit people.
OTHERMALE:It doesn't mean there's a problem.
LEADFEMALE:There's a problem.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's too bad.
OTHERFEMALE:Pass the meatballs.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, I take total blame for this.
SUPMALE:I know it's a bummer, but no matter what comes down, we're in this together.
LEADFEMALE: I won't know till we reconstruct our finances, but I figure we probably have to pay a small fee.
SUPMALE:That doesn't sound so bad.
OTHERMALE:Unless we get a prison term.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, I'll come by tomorrow night, we'll sit down and go over all the receipts.
LEADFEMALE:Pass the
LEADMALE:I will not.
LEADFEMALE:Now get out, Stanley.
SUPMALE:Calm down.
LEADMALE:I can eat it plain.
SUPFEMALE:Well, gotta go now.
LEADFEMALE:See you tomorrow night.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe this is happening.
OTHERFEMALE:Our whole married life, I was so careful about money.
OTHERMALE:And all the time, Stanley had his hand in the cookie jar.
OTHERMALE:In the olden days, the Vikings would cut off your hand if they caught you stealing.
LEADMALE:They'd cut out your tongue if they caught you lying.
LEADMALE:They'd cut off your feet if they caught you trespassing.
LEADFEMALE:Too bad there wasn't a Viking around when Stan knocked you up.
LEADFEMALE:That means "Hello Dorothy" in Spanish.
LEADMALE:You've really taken command of the language, haven't you? Si.
OTHERFEMALE:That means "yes.
SUPMALE:" Gee, Rose, if I closed my eyes, I'd swear I was in Ecuador.
LEADMALE:Sorry, that was me.
LEADMALE:Okay, Rose, I'm ready for class.
OTHERFEMALE:You look like you're going to a cocktail party.
LEADFEMALE:Well, gracias, honey.
LEADFEMALE: Hi, it's me, Stan.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
SUPMALE:Oh, so thoughtful of you to bring garbage.
SUPMALE:These are my tax receipts.
LEADMALE:Our future is in this bag.
SUPFEMALE:How appropriate.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, girls.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Stan.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, you look great in that blouse.
SUPFEMALE:Are those new? I mean Is that new? Stanley, you naughty boy.
LEADFEMALE:When was the last time somebody gave you a spanking? Vegas.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Blanche, we don't wanna be late.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, darn, I keep forgetting.
LEADMALE:I'm not supposed to speak English.
SUPFEMALE:Being bilingual really gets me confused.
SUPMALE:Ziploc bags get you confused.
SUPMALE:See you girls later.
OTHERFEMALE:Adi√≥s.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, you look younger than ever.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Stan.
LEADMALE:That's a beautiful toupee you're wearing.
LEADMALE:There, now we're both liars.
LEADMALE:Okay, Stan, let's get this over with.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, okay, here's a copy of the tax return.
LEADFEMALE:We'll go over each deduction individually and document it with a receipt.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:What the hell is this? Oh, uh, that It's a business loss.
SUPMALE:I made a bad investment.
LEADFEMALE:What investment? You never told me you were investing.
SUPMALE:Well, I actually wasn't planning to, but I knew this was a money maker the minute I laid eyes on it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm talking tie bibs, babe.
SUPMALE:Tie bibs.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Little bibs that fit over your necktie.
LEADFEMALE:You go out to lunch, you don't worry about staining your tie.
LEADMALE:It's a perfect gift, a great idea.
LEADMALE:And the best part was, no one else had ever thought of it.
LEADMALE:To this day, I don't know why I couldn't sell them.
SUPMALE: Did you ever hear of napkins, Stanley? Hey.
LEADFEMALE:So I didn't make the cover of Fortune.
SUPFEMALE:I was just trying to do something to make things better for us.
LEADMALE:All our friends were moving up, and we were stuck with a one-way ticket to Palookaville.
LEADMALE:I wanted to be someone, babe.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted to be a contender.
SUPMALE:Stanley, did you just rent On the Waterfront? You know me so well.
LEADMALE:No, I don't.
SUPMALE:What is this $2500 deduction for a gift? This is a receipt for the diamond ring that you gave me on our I know.
LEADFEMALE:You spent $2500 on me? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Figured after 38 years, you deserve something major.
LEADMALE:Listen, I know we've had our differences, but you've always stuck by me when it really counted.
LEADFEMALE:I'll always love you for that.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you, Stanley.
SUPMALE:Stanley, what are all these deductions for a Corvette and a rented garage? Dorothy, don't get mad.
SUPFEMALE:And don't hit me if you do.
LEADFEMALE:I kind of bought a Corvette without telling you.
LEADFEMALE:You bought a car without telling me? I was going through a mid-life crisis.
LEADFEMALE:So was I.
OTHERMALE:I gave myself a perm and took up Jazzercise.
LEADFEMALE: You bought a car without telling me? How can I explain it? When I sat behind the wheel, people noticed me.
LEADMALE:People paid attention.
LEADFEMALE:That car was a chick magnet.
SUPFEMALE:That is it, Stanley.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:Get out.
LEADMALE: Get out of my house.
LEADFEMALE:Get out of my life.
LEADMALE:What about the audit? We can get into trouble.
LEADFEMALE:We could wind up in jail.
LEADMALE:Good, good.
LEADMALE:I want you to go to jail.
LEADFEMALE:And I want a big bald convict named Bubba to pick you for his girlfriend.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, you don't mean that.
OTHERFEMALE:The hell I don't.
OTHERMALE:This is all your fault.
SUPFEMALE:Look, it doesn't matter who's to blame here.
SUPFEMALE:We're in this together.
LEADMALE:If you don't wanna cooperate,
LEADMALE:you're gonna be hurting yourself.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:And I hate you for it.
SUPFEMALE:What's all the racket? Oh, nothing.
LEADMALE:I could just murder Stan.
LEADFEMALE:He bought a Corvette without telling me.
OTHERMALE:Why are you complaining? Your father did things without telling me.
OTHERFEMALE:How do you think I got pregnant with your brother Phil? Just remember, I'll handle everything.
SUPMALE:I'm a salesman.
LEADFEMALE:I deal with people.
LEADFEMALE:I know what I'm doing.
SUPMALE:Shut up, Stanley.
LEADMALE:Mellow out.
OTHERMALE:Once we get in there, we have to exercise psychological control.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I'm wearing this suit.
LEADFEMALE:You make me sick.
SUPMALE:Hey, everyone knows good guys wear white.
LEADMALE:This suit subliminally tells the auditor I'm a good guy.
LEADMALE:I could vomit just looking at you.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:And Mrs.
SUPMALE:Zbornak, step into my office, please.
LEADFEMALE:Watch me work my magic, babe.
LEADFEMALE:Good afternoon.
OTHERFEMALE:I am Wendell Murray.
LEADMALE:I'll be conducting your audit.
LEADFEMALE:Nice to meet you.
LEADMALE:I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
LEADFEMALE:This is my ex-husband, Stanley.
OTHERFEMALE:Wendell.
SUPFEMALE:Paisan.
LEADMALE:We're going to jail.
LEADMALE:What did you call me? Before he answers that, let me reiterate, we are bitterly divorced.
LEADFEMALE:Relax, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Wendell, I called you "paisan.
LEADFEMALE:" Friend, brother of the scalp.
LEADFEMALE:If I may get philosophical for one moment, I've always believed we bald men are like any other minority.
SUPFEMALE:That's why we have to stick together.
LEADMALE:Who you calling bald? Nobody, nobody.
LEADFEMALE:Just shut up and put your hair on.
LEADMALE:Yes, dear.
LEADMALE:Wendell, if I may call you Wendell, did I mention that I'm a member of the Rainbow Coalition? Mr.
LEADMALE:And Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Zbornak, may I remind you that as an employee of the IRS, it is my sole obligation to see that the government gets all the money it has coming to it?
OTHERMALE:And I'll bet you do a fine job of it.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:However, I have no personal stake in this whatsoever.
LEADFEMALE:Is that understood?
OTHERMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:You bet, my man.
SUPFEMALE:Then cut the crap, paisan.
SUPFEMALE:You know, folks, I've been at this job almost four years now, and in that short time I can honestly say I have never seen such an inept, clumsy, downright stupid attempt to avoid paying income tax.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:That means a lot coming from you.
LEADFEMALE:I can also honestly say that I'm amazed the way this lays out, you only owe a small amount.
LEADMALE:You're kidding.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:$5000.
LEADMALE:$5000 We don't have that kind of money.
LEADMALE:Uncle Sam doesn't like to hear that.
LEADMALE:Aunt Dorothy doesn't enjoy saying it.
LEADFEMALE:We'll expect you each to cough up $2500 in 30 days.
OTHERMALE:What if we can't? We'll put a lien on your bank accounts, property, and your salaries.
OTHERFEMALE:And if that doesn't work, we'll just have to incarcerate you.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
OTHERFEMALE:We're going to jail.
SUPMALE:That's right, Stanley.
LEADMALE:Please, let me know where you and Bubba register for your china.
SUPMALE:Rose, honey, what are you still doing up? Studying for my Spanish test.
SUPFEMALE:Like somebody else I know should be.
LEADMALE:Don't strain yourself.
LEADMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:Blanche, these are the answers to the test.
OTHERMALE:Where did you get these? I'll give you one guess.
LEADMALE:You slept with the teacher.
LEADFEMALE:Of course I didn't sleep with the teacher.
SUPMALE:You have to be very careful these days.
LEADFEMALE:I promised I would if he gave me the answers.
LEADMALE:I call it "safe-teasing.
SUPMALE:" Well, you can just have them back.
OTHERFEMALE:I've only cheated once in my life.
OTHERFEMALE:I vowed I'd never do it again.
SUPFEMALE:Couldn't handle the guilt? No, I got caught.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it was the worst experience of my whole life.
LEADMALE:St.
SUPFEMALE:Olaf was rocked by the scandal.
SUPMALE:What'd you do, shortchange somebody down at the feed store? Worse.
SUPMALE:I fed BB's to my prize lamb, Harlan, so he'd weigh in heavier at the county fair.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:How do you sleep at night? I knew it was wrong all along, but I wanted to win first prize.
LEADFEMALE:And I would have if Harlan could have held it just a little longer.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, did you just miss a real gem.
OTHERMALE:Poor Dorothy, what are you doing up again? I can't sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Every time I close my eyes, I see Uncle Sam going through my purse.
SUPFEMALE:Worried about the money you owe the government? No, Blanche, I'm worried about whether Michael Jackson will be able to buy the remains of the Elephant Man.
LEADMALE:Really? Gee, I'd be worried about the money.
LEADFEMALE:Does anyone around here ever go to bed? I can't sleep, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:I can't work, I can't eat.
OTHERFEMALE:All I can do is think about how I'm gonna raise the rest of that 2500 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:I wish I had it, pussycat.
LEADMALE:Oh, I know, Ma.
LEADMALE:If you had it, you'd give it to me.
LEADFEMALE:Don't put words in my mouth.
LEADMALE:I said, "I wish I had it.
SUPMALE:" I've put away a little money, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:It's not nearly enough, but you're welcome to it.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I could lend you a couple of hundred.
SUPFEMALE:I'd planned on putting it toward my cruise to the Bahamas,
LEADMALE:but what the heck?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you, girls.
LEADMALE:I'll just buy a couple I really appreciate this.
OTHERFEMALE:And limbo under the clothesline.
SUPMALE:But I can't accept it.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I only have half of the 2500.
LEADFEMALE:And since I don't qualify for a bank loan, I'm just gonna have to sell some of my stuff.
SUPMALE:Hold it.
LEADMALE:No daughter of mine is selling her stuff.
SUPFEMALE:It's a sin, it's a crime, and let's face it, Dorothy, lately you can't give it away.
LEADMALE:Ma, I'm talking about selling some of my belongings.
OTHERFEMALE:I called a couple of pawn shops and I'm gonna check them out tomorrow.
LEADMALE:I'm wonderful at bargaining.
LEADMALE:I'll go with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Me, too.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks, girls.
LEADMALE:Oh You know, I can't believe this is happening.
LEADFEMALE:I was so careful about my finances all my life.
LEADMALE:I thought that by now I'd have some sort of security.
SUPFEMALE:And here I am, flat broke.
OTHERFEMALE:I know what you mean.
LEADMALE:I never dreamt I'd be single and working at this age.
OTHERFEMALE:I never dreamt I'd be this age.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me tell you girls the three most important things I learned about life.
LEADFEMALE:Number 
LEADFEMALE:Hold fast to your friends.
LEADMALE:Number 
LEADMALE:There's no such thing as security.
LEADFEMALE:And number 
LEADFEMALE:Don't go see Ishtar.
LEADFEMALE:Now girls, listen.
LEADMALE:Listen.
LEADMALE:Remember, the way to make a deal is we state our price, stick to our guns, and undo another button on our blouses.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, that is ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:Unbuttoning my blouse is not gonna get us a better deal.
OTHERFEMALE:You are absolutely right.
SUPFEMALE:Don't touch yours.
LEADFEMALE:Rose and I will unbutton ours.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Please, don't hurt me, just take my money.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I think I got my verbs mixed up.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks a lot, lady.
LEADFEMALE:So, what do you want? I would like to pawn a few things.
SUPFEMALE:You got a lot of things here.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh, how much will you give me? $100 for everything.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Sir! I am shocked at your insensitivity.
OTHERFEMALE:May I point out to you that this is no ordinary pitcher? This pitcher was carried thousands of miles across the ocean by her great-great-grandmother.
LEADMALE:A woman who came to this country in search of a better life, as have done millions of immigrants throughout history.
SUPMALE:Why, this pitcher is a symbol of freedom.
LEADFEMALE:This pitcher is a symbol of liberty.
LEADMALE:This pitcher was made in Taiwan.
LEADFEMALE:Well! Maybe they stopped off at the Ellis Island gift shop.
LEADMALE:The point is, this pitcher is worth a considerable amount of money.
SUPMALE:Lady, that story is worth more than the pitcher.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, except for the ring that you are wearing, nothing that you brought in here is worth anything.
LEADMALE:How much for the ring?
OTHERFEMALE:$800.
LEADMALE:Oh, I couldn't pawn this.
SUPFEMALE:$900.
SUPFEMALE:Take it, Dorothy.
LEADMALE: No, I couldn't, it This is the only nice thing that Stan ever gave me.
LEADFEMALE:$1000.
LEADMALE:It's also the only valuable thing.
SUPMALE:Hock it.
LEADFEMALE:I can't.
SUPMALE:$1200.
LEADMALE:My final offer.
LEADFEMALE:No, this isn't for sale.
LEADMALE:I mean, there are some things that have no price.
OTHERFEMALE:I This means a lot to me.
LEADFEMALE:My husband gave it to me after 38 years of marriage.
LEADMALE:And after 38 years of marriage, he also dumped you for a 23-year-old stewardess with firm thighs and perky breasts.
OTHERMALE:You got yourself a ring, muchacho.
SUPMALE: Hi Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:What are you two doing here? I thought you had Spanish class.
OTHERFEMALE:We do but we're not going.
LEADMALE:We dropped out.
LEADFEMALE:What about your promotion at the counseling center? Oh, I can just forget about that.
SUPFEMALE:Norwegians are notoriously bad at Spanish.
LEADMALE:I guess that's why there are no herring tacos.
LEADFEMALE:And it was a big waste of my time.
SUPFEMALE:There was only one cute guy there.
LEADMALE:And he kept doodling the name "Kenny" in his notebook.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in.
OTHERMALE:I have the check for my half of the money.
LEADMALE:Hi, girls.
LEADMALE:Hi, Stan.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Stan.
OTHERMALE:Where's your hair? Oh, damn.
SUPFEMALE:I never should have opened that sunroof.
SUPFEMALE:This just isn't my week.
LEADMALE:Here you go.
SUPMALE:Thanks, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Dorothy, uh, listen.
LEADMALE:I, um I'm really sorry about all of this.
LEADMALE:It's all my fault.
SUPMALE:Here.
OTHERMALE:A little something for you.
SUPMALE:My ring.
SUPMALE:I didn't want you to sell it.
LEADFEMALE:Not like this.
LEADFEMALE:How did you know?
LEADMALE:I called while you were out.
SUPMALE:Sophia told me what happened, so I went and bought it back.
LEADMALE:Stanley, you didn't have to do that.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted to do it, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Because, in spite of everything, you're still the best.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'm gonna cry.
SUPMALE:Honey, don't do that.
LEADFEMALE:Your eyes will get all beady, and your nose will swell up like Karl Malden.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, if you bought the ring back, how did you come up with the money? Sold the Corvette.
LEADMALE:You didn't.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it was tough.
SUPMALE:I had great times with that car, but the times I had with you were a hell of a lot more important.
LEADMALE:Oh, Stanley.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm so sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Me too.
OTHERMALE: I guess I became what I always feared 
LEADMALE:Another middle-aged bald guy who drives a Toyota.
LEADMALE:Oh, Stanley, this This is the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, honey.
LEADMALE:Let's go down to Riley's and see if we can meet some men.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:If you're taking Biscayne Blvd.
LEADFEMALE:, keep an eye out for my hair.
LEADMALE:We, um, really pulled it out of the fire, didn't we, babe? We sure did.
LEADFEMALE:It felt nice, you and me, working as a team again.
LEADMALE:It did feel nice.
LEADMALE:Reminds me of when we were first married.
SUPMALE:We sure had some good times.
LEADFEMALE:So, as long as I'm here, what do you say, for old time's sake, you wanna go to bed?  Dorothy! Dorothy, let go, it was a joke.
OTHERMALE:You're hurting me.
LEADFEMALE:You're really hurting me.
SUPFEMALE:
