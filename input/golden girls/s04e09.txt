SUPMALE:Hey! You're not even gonna ask what's wrong? What's wrong, Ma? I got three days to live.
LEADMALE:Fine, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:I'll scratch the Bengay off the grocery list.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you're so insensitive.
LEADMALE:Ma, you are not dying.
LEADFEMALE:I am, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:I had a dream last night, a death dream.
LEADMALE:Your father spoke to me.
OTHERFEMALE:Spoke to you? How? Do I look like Rich Little? Just listen.
SUPMALE:I'm sitting in the living room, and the clock strikes 9:00.
LEADFEMALE:Then the bell rings.
LEADMALE:It's your father in his fedora.
LEADMALE:He always wore a fedora on Saturday.
LEADFEMALE:He walks towards me, reaches out his hand and says, "Sophia, you can come now.
LEADMALE:There's room for you now.
SUPFEMALE:" That's it? You want him to show up with Barbara Eden and the college all-American football team? It's a dream, not a Bob Hope special.
OTHERMALE:I'm dying, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Saturday, 9:00.
SUPMALE:Don't make any plans.
LEADMALE:Ma, you're being ridiculous.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:When was the last Saturday night you had plans? Oh, thank you, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Those look lovely.
LEADFEMALE:So do you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, you really got all dressed up for your brother.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we do come from the South.
OTHERMALE:We always felt it was important to look absolutely great in front of company.
SUPMALE:Hi, girls.
LEADMALE:What time does Clayton get here? Oh, any minute now.
LEADMALE:Oh, we better put out the welcome mat.
LEADMALE:We don't have a welcome mat.
LEADFEMALE:What about the one Dorothy says is at the foot of your bed?  Oh, there's Clayton now.
LEADFEMALE:Remember what I said.
SUPFEMALE:No remarks about his marriage breaking up.
LEADMALE:He's still a little touchy.
LEADMALE:Clayton! Baby brother! Sister! Oh, my, look at you all gussied up.
OTHERMALE:Prettier than a spring-bloomin' peach tree on a dewy April morning.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you oughtta talk, all fresh-scrubbed and rosy-cheeked like a country parson at a September hoedown.
SUPFEMALE:Why do I get the feeling they had a maid named Honeybee when they grew up?  Come on in, Clayton.
LEADMALE:I want you to meet my best friends Dorothy and Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Nice to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:It's a pleasure.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, so nice to see you.
SUPMALE:How was your trip, Clayton? Oh, fine.
SUPMALE:It just went by in no time.
SUPMALE:That usually means he met a stewardess he liked.
LEADMALE:Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Lunch, dinner or drinks? Dinner.
SUPMALE:I'm beginning to see the family resemblance.
LEADMALE:Honey, come on inside.
SUPMALE:I'll get you all settled down.
LEADMALE:Then I want to tell you all the wonderful things I have planned for us to do.
OTHERMALE:OK.
SUPMALE:It was so nice finally meeting you all.
SUPFEMALE:See you later, Clayton.
LEADMALE:Isn't it nice to see a brother and sister who are such good friends? It certainly is.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I always wish that I could have been closer to my brother, Phil.
LEADFEMALE:You know, go places together, share experiences.
OTHERFEMALE:Although I did love borrowing his clothes.
LEADMALE:Did you like wearing boys' clothes growing up? No, but fortunately neither did my brother Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, why are you sitting here in the dark? Conserving electricity for those who will still be living past Saturday.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma Put out your hands, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:What for? So I can say hello like Magic Johnson.
LEADMALE:So I'm gonna give you some of my personal things.
LEADMALE:My bank book, some stocks Oh, Ma, come on, now.
LEADMALE:This is crazy.
LEADMALE:Hi, y'all.
LEADMALE:Oh, fabulous.
LEADFEMALE:Roy and Dale are back.
LEADFEMALE:So, where are you two off to tonight? Oh, that's a surprise.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Isn't that my silver locket in there? Nice getting to know you, gomer.
LEADFEMALE:See you around.
SUPMALE:What's all this about a surprise? Oh, well, I've done a little matchmaking.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, not again.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, again.
LEADMALE:Now, you are 45 years old.
SUPFEMALE:You've been single almost two years.
LEADMALE:Well, both Dorothy and I know how much fun the single life is.
OTHERFEMALE:Many's the night Dorothy has sat here alone in this room watching me go out on dates.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes I watch her go from the kitchen window.
SUPFEMALE:It's easier to bay at the moon.
LEADMALE:I just don't want you being afraid to get back on that horse and make a commitment again.
SUPMALE: Here's your horse pulling up now.
SUPMALE:Hello, Lois.
SUPMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:Clayton, remember Lois from the museum? Of course.
LEADMALE:So nice to see you again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's a pleasure.
LEADMALE:You two can get reacquainted on the way.
LEADFEMALE:These are your tickets for the concert in the park.
LEADFEMALE:It starts in 15 minutes, so you better hurry up, now.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:Have a good time!  Good night! I was never any good at blind dating.
OTHERMALE:I always felt so awkward.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, I have a surefire icebreaker I can teach you right now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, once you learn this any man is putty in your hands.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, come on.
SUPFEMALE:That is ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I'm certainly not gonna waste my time listening to this adolescent nonsense.
OTHERMALE:Did you say putty? Ha ha ha ha.
LEADFEMALE:Sit back.
LEADMALE:Now, just play like we're at the movies.
LEADMALE:OK.
OTHERFEMALE:First I start to yawn a little.
OTHERMALE:Then I put my hands up over my head like this Oh, Blanche, I know that one.
LEADFEMALE:You end up with your arm around me.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but that's just the first part.
LEADFEMALE:Did you know that if you blow right on the tip of a man's earlobe, it can drive him absolutely crazy? I'll show you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna be dead in 24 hours.
LEADFEMALE:Couldn't you stay in the closet for one more day? Rose, what are you doing here? Clayton.
LEADFEMALE:It's my late night at the counseling center.
SUPFEMALE:But what are you doing here? Blanche told me she was sending you on a date.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, she did.
OTHERMALE:Didn't it work out? Well, let's just say Blanche has it in her head what type is right for me, and she's way off.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet I could sit here for a minute and tell you what your type is.
LEADMALE:I'm good at this.
SUPFEMALE:Gosh, I'm stuck.
LEADMALE:You haven't even started.
LEADMALE:No, I'm stuck on the gum somebody left on this bench.
SUPFEMALE:OK, now, you just give me your honest reactions when people go by.
SUPMALE:That's how I'll tell.
SUPMALE:OK.
LEADMALE:Here comes one.
LEADFEMALE:Go.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Too thin.
LEADFEMALE:Here comes one.
SUPFEMALE:Too short? Next.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Clayton! Clayton, you're not playing fair.
SUPFEMALE:That's a man.
LEADFEMALE:That's a man and you're a man.
LEADFEMALE:You're both men.
SUPMALE: Clayton, you're that thing that everyone said Olga Larsen's nephew was 'cause he wore paisley clogs and gave out puff pastry on Halloween.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been called a lot of things in my time, but that's a first for that one.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I'm gay, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:But Blanche told us you were married.
OTHERFEMALE:I was.
LEADMALE:After a while I just couldn't deny the truth to myself.
SUPMALE:Seems silly still denying it to my big sister.
SUPMALE:Well, have you tried telling her? Every time I see her.
SUPFEMALE:And I always chicken out.
SUPMALE:Oh I know Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, she'd be upset, but not for long.
SUPFEMALE:And just think how it would help you two in the long run.
SUPMALE:But how do I keep from chickening out? By telling her.
LEADFEMALE:Tonight, while you've still got your dander up.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Did I say something embarrassing? No.
LEADFEMALE:No, Rose.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:You're absolutely right.
LEADFEMALE:I've got to tell her tonight.
SUPFEMALE:But it's not gonna be easy.
SUPMALE:I mean, I still haven't told Blanche I was the one who stole the Montgomery Clift poster off her wall when she left for college.
SUPFEMALE: Ma, what are you doing up? Someone left the lock off my cage.
LEADMALE:I couldn't sleep.
SUPFEMALE:I was afraid I'd have that dream again.
LEADFEMALE:What are you two doing up? Well, I'm waiting up for Clayton.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna make sure he had a good time tonight.
LEADFEMALE:My brother and I are very close.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's sweet, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Evening, ladies.
LEADMALE:Well, Clayton Hollingsworth, it's about time.
SUPFEMALE:You and your date must have really hit it off.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Rose.
SUPMALE:What are you doing with Clayton? We ran into each other in the park.
LEADMALE:What happened to Lois? Oh, she went home.
SUPFEMALE:We weren't really suited, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Not suited? Clayton, sometimes I do not understand you.
OTHERMALE:Time after time I fix you up with attractive, eligible women, and nothing happens.
LEADMALE:It's time you found yourself a woman.
SUPFEMALE:Now, what is the matter with you? Tell her, Clayton.
SUPMALE:I will, Rose.
LEADMALE:Tell me what? Well, I ran into Rose in the park, and And? And we had a long talk, and And? And we slept together tonight.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, all that stuff I said about preparing for a burial, forget it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:You finally came to your senses.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:I decided to be cremated instead.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma.
SUPMALE:Oh It's a great idea.
LEADMALE:My ashes can be divided among you, your brother, Phil, and your sister, Gloria.
LEADFEMALE:Nah, forget Gloria.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to spread myself too thin.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, girls.
OTHERFEMALE:I need to talk.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey, what is it? All day long Blanche has been giving me looks.
OTHERFEMALE:I think she's really mad at me.
LEADMALE:Look, Rose, what happened between you and Clayton last night is your business, not Blanche's.
LEADMALE:That's just the point, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Nothing happened between Clayton and me.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing physical, anyway.
OTHERMALE:Well, why did Clayton say the two of you slept together if you hadn't? Because he's trying to hide something about himself from Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even feel right saying it out loud.
LEADMALE:Maybe if I just whispered it.
SUPFEMALE:Clayton is a hobo? No, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Oh! Oh! Now, now I get it.
LEADMALE:Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I was gonna have to draw you a picture.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm not sure I'd know how.
SUPMALE:Hey! I don't get to know? No, Ma.
LEADMALE:OK, have it your way, but nobody can keep a secret from Sophia Petrillo.
SUPFEMALE:Whatever that guy's hiding, I could smoke it out of him in three or four quick questions.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:Perfect timing.
OTHERMALE:Ma.
LEADMALE:So, Clayton, what do you think of this Miami weather so far? Oh, it's lovely.
OTHERMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:Have you ever been to Europe? No, but it's always been a dream of mine.
OTHERMALE:Interesting.
SUPFEMALE:How many fingers am I holding up? Two.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:You can go back in the living room now.
SUPMALE:The man's as gay as a picnic basket.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, that that is That is incredible.
LEADMALE:How did you know? I heard him singing in the shower.
LEADMALE:He's the only man I ever knew who knows all the words to "Send In The Clowns.
OTHERMALE:" Rose, I owe you an apology.
LEADMALE:You sure do.
SUPFEMALE:I shouldn't have got you mixed up in all this.
LEADMALE:It's just so hard to tell Blanche the truth.
LEADFEMALE:Clayton, you're selling your sister short.
LEADFEMALE:Now, at times, Blanche can be very understanding and compassionate and forgiving.
OTHERMALE:Get away from my baby brother, you cradle-snatching, empty-headed, two-faced dummy.
LEADMALE:And then at other times she can be a real bitch.
SUPMALE:Blanche, there's something you should know.
LEADMALE:Butt out, Clayton.
LEADMALE:This doesn't concern you.
SUPMALE:It most certainly does concern him.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Because he was seduced by a bubble-head whose hair looks like it was colorized by Ted Turner? Now, just a minute.
OTHERMALE:Butt out, Clayton.
OTHERFEMALE:This doesn't concern you.
SUPFEMALE:You're gonna regret this when you have to come begging on hands and knees for forgiveness.
LEADMALE:Oh? Then I shall never regret it, because I never intend to apologize.
LEADFEMALE:We'll see about that.
LEADFEMALE:I wish you hadn't done that, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hush up.
LEADFEMALE:It was for your own good.
OTHERMALE:There's something you just don't understand.
SUPMALE:Oh, I understand perfectly.
LEADFEMALE:I pushed you into meeting all those women.
LEADMALE:That's why this happened.
OTHERMALE:But it is over.
SUPMALE:Rose will be just fine.
LEADMALE:Blanche, it's not as simple Oh, Clayton, honey, leave it alone.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, listen.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing happened between me and Rose.
SUPMALE:Just like nothing ever happens between me and any of the women you set me up with.
SUPMALE:There's a reason.
LEADFEMALE:What are you saying, Clayton? I'm saying I'm gay, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Clayton, please be serious.
OTHERMALE:You're just saying that so I won't set you up with any more women.
SUPFEMALE:No, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Well, then you're saying it 'cause you're trying to get back at me for something.
LEADMALE:Blanche Clay, I know you too well for this.
LEADMALE:After all, I know it can't be true.
LEADMALE:You're my brother.
LEADMALE:It's true, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Maybe I ought to just leave you alone for a while.
LEADMALE:Clayton Hollingsworth.
SUPFEMALE:You look me in the face and tell me you really are what you just said you are.
SUPFEMALE:I think you heard me the first time, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Hey, Harry.
LEADMALE:Flip on the game, will you? Not another game.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Tina, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you back at the house.
OTHERMALE: Clayton.
LEADMALE:Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:How'd you find me here? Well, I knew that you and Rose were here last night.
OTHERMALE:May I join you? Of course.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:You know what that popcorn reminds me of? Rex's Drive-In out at the lake.
LEADMALE:You remember the night my date and I parked right next to you and your date? Pretty soon it got to be a contest who could fog up whose car the fastest.
OTHERFEMALE:I think you won.
SUPMALE:You weren't doing too badly considering you were in a convertible.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:You know, Clay, I've been thinking a lot about what you told me today, and I've also been thinking a lot about that boy at Rex's Drive-In, and, honey, the two pictures don't go together.
LEADFEMALE:There's just something wrong with one of them.
LEADMALE:But it's not the one you're hoping, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:It was the heater fogging up my car windows that night.
SUPFEMALE:So what can I bring you, sweetheart? Don't you dare talk to him like that.
LEADMALE:Now, you get out of here.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I think he was talking to you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I'm having a little trouble putting this all together.
SUPFEMALE:Clayton, I just feel like I don't know you anymore.
LEADMALE:I'm the same person I always was.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're not.
LEADFEMALE:You used to be just like me.
LEADFEMALE:What? Great-looking? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Charming? Yes.
LEADMALE:Irresistible to men? My God, Clayton, you are me.
OTHERFEMALE:But I still just can't Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:I spent a long time lying to myself.
LEADFEMALE:It felt a lot better when I stopped.
SUPFEMALE:It feels better being honest with you, too, and I'd hate to think that this is gonna keep us from being friends.
LEADMALE:Well, honey, of course it isn't.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get used to this.
LEADFEMALE:I will.
LEADMALE:Well, look at me already.
SUPFEMALE:I'm practically comfortable seeing you here in a gay bar.
LEADMALE:Blanche, this isn't a gay bar.
OTHERMALE:Clay, now, we did say we were gonna be honest with each other.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, now, I can do my part.
LEADMALE:You just watch this.
LEADFEMALE:You all, over at the bar.
LEADFEMALE:I just want to say that I would be very proud to have any one of you date my brother.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd rather date you, lady.
LEADMALE:Sweet Jesus, I've just done the impossible.
SUPFEMALE:I've converted one.
LEADMALE: Dorothy, get dressed.
SUPMALE:We're going out to celebrate Clayton's last night in town.
LEADMALE:Oh, terrific.
LEADMALE:Let's go to JosÃ©'s.
SUPMALE:We always go there to celebrate.
LEADMALE:The food is great.
LEADFEMALE:And they make all the waiters wear these really skintight bullfighters' pants.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Let's go to Amelio's.
SUPFEMALE:T minus ten seconds, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma, will you give it up? You are not dying.
LEADFEMALE:Eight, seven, six There is not going to be a doorbell or a pop.
SUPMALE:five, four, three, two one.
LEADMALE:There is not going to be anything.
LEADMALE:You see? Ten seconds, nothing happened.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, God! Ma, stop.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, suddenly somebody believes me.
LEADFEMALE:Did I hear the bell? Listen, Rose, do me a favor.
SUPMALE:Look out the peephole and see who's at the door.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Gee, it's kinda hard to tell.
SUPMALE:All I can see is a fedora.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:Who's that at the door? It's me, Blanche.
LEADMALE:The other side.
OTHERMALE:Move, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, don't.
LEADFEMALE:I have to, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Ma! Mildred, what are you doing here? When do I always wear my lucky bowling hat? We're bowling tonight? Didn't you get my message the other night? No one answered the door.
LEADFEMALE:I figured you were napping, so I yelled outside your window we had room.
LEADFEMALE:Wait Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Were your exact words, "Sophia, you can come now.
LEADMALE:We have room now"? And were you wearing that hat at the time? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Hasta luego, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:I'm going bowling.
SUPFEMALE:Well, let's go to dinner, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:Have fun.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, honey.
SUPFEMALE:There's something I have to say to you.
LEADMALE:It's just two little words, but they are the hardest two little words in all the whole world for me to say.
OTHERFEMALE:"Not tonight"? No.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, if you've come here to apologize, I accept.
SUPMALE:Just like that? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, for me, just the fact that you thought of those words is plenty considering what a selfish, conceited person you are.
LEADMALE:But I had a whole speech planned, Rose a-about how nice you were to my brother and-and how proud I am to have such a sweet person as my friend.
LEADFEMALE:Now I can't say it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, sure you can.
SUPFEMALE:No, I can't.
LEADFEMALE:You just ruined it.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm so sorry.
LEADMALE:Oh, I forgive you, Rose.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:
