LEADFEMALE:Can I offer you more coffee?
LEADMALE:No, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Rod, we better go
SUPFEMALE:before we outstay our welcome.
LEADFEMALE:Too late.
SUPFEMALE:We certainly enjoyed having you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, right.
SUPMALE:Welcome to the neighborhood.
OTHERMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Good night already.
SUPMALE:Ma, I cannot believe you, rushing them out of the house! Rushing? They took forever.
LEADMALE:Two hours to eat pasta and salad? Your father could eat dinner, read the paper, make love and have a pedicure in an hour.
SUPMALE:And without getting up from the kitchen table.
LEADMALE:I think they were delightful.
SUPFEMALE:I did too.
LEADFEMALE:So did I.
SUPMALE:I just love to welcome people to the neighborhood.
LEADMALE:In fact, back home, I used to run our town's VÃ¤lkomm Wagon.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy, was that fun! Whenever a new family would move in to St.
OTHERFEMALE:Olaf, we'd hop on the tractor and go to the neighbors' farm, carrying vats of smoked fish and big pitchers of freshly-squeezed potato juice.
LEADMALE:While Cousin Dat played "Getting To Know You" through the hole in his windpipe.
LEADMALE:Tell me, did you ever accompany him through the hole in your head?  Sophia, would you mind getting that, please? No problem.
LEADMALE:I'll drag my bad leg over to the door.
LEADMALE:Ma'am, you shouldn't open the door
SUPMALE:without asking who it is.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Who is it?
OTHERMALE:Detective Mullins, Miami PD.
LEADMALE:Please, come in.
LEADFEMALE:Please excuse my mother.
OTHERMALE:She's a little upset.
SUPMALE:She just found out she has the same hairdresser as Whoopi Goldberg.
LEADMALE:This is my associate, Bobby Hopkins.
LEADMALE:Detective Mullins, I am Blanche Devereaux.
LEADFEMALE:These are my roommates, Dorothy and Rose.
LEADMALE:They're innocent.
LEADFEMALE:I am not.
LEADMALE:No, Bobby, you don't have to write that last part.
SUPMALE:That was just a come-on.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry to take up your time at this hour, but I'd like to ask some questions.
SUPMALE:I am single, I'm free Saturday night.
SUPFEMALE:And I can arch my back until my head touches my heels.
SUPMALE:If you don't mind, I'll write that down.
SUPMALE:Won't you sit down? I'd like to ask you about your neighbors, the McDowells.
LEADMALE:They're not who you think.
SUPMALE:You mean we invited the wrong people to dinner? In a manner of speaking.
SUPFEMALE:You see, your next-door neighbors are dealers in stolen gems.
LEADFEMALE:Those sweet people?
SUPFEMALE:I'm afraid so.
LEADFEMALE:We think they'll be making a major move in the next 72 hours, so we'd like to set up shop here.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course.
SUPMALE:You can both stay in my room.
SUPMALE:Now, wait just a minute.
LEADMALE:All right, you can have the boy.
LEADFEMALE:They can't just move in here.
SUPMALE:Let them do their work from a van, like real police on TV.
LEADMALE:We'd like your cooperation, but you have every right to say no.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Um, girls, I think we need to discuss this.
LEADMALE:Gentlemen, if you'll just excuse us for a moment.
SUPMALE:Ladies, I think we must do this.
LEADMALE:It's our duty as Americans.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:Two policemen living in our house? What's there to be afraid of? Once you strip away the gruff exterior, badge, gun and uniform You've got a naked policeman.
LEADFEMALE:Exactly.
LEADMALE:Blanche, this is serious.
SUPMALE:If we can assist the police, we should.
SUPMALE:Their job is hard enough.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:My father was a policeman.
LEADMALE:Wasn't your father a farmer? On the weekdays.
OTHERFEMALE:Saturday and Sunday, he and the other farmers became volunteer policemen.
LEADMALE:Of course, the only crime in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf was that more people didn't practice better oral hygiene.
LEADFEMALE:Mostly they sat around the jailhouse and took pictures of each other behind the bars in goofy poses.
LEADFEMALE:I vote no.
SUPMALE:Well, I agree with Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:Why should we get involved in something that might be dangerous? If it was dangerous, they wouldn't let us get involved.
LEADMALE:Blanche has a point.
SUPFEMALE:And if anything happens, we've got the police right here with us.
LEADMALE:Maybe you're right.
LEADMALE:OK, then, it's all settled.
LEADFEMALE:They can stay.
OTHERMALE:Detective Mullins, we decided you all can stay, so welcome to our home.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:We appreciate this very much.
LEADMALE:We'll be back tomorrow to set up.
LEADMALE:You won't have to change your lifestyles.
LEADMALE:We just need a bedroom and bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:We'll use the kitchen as base.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:We'll just cook in the fireplace and pee in the broom closet.
OTHERFEMALE:Al? Al!
SUPMALE:Yeah?
LEADFEMALE:How do you like the pasta? It's OK.
SUPMALE:I'm not that crazy about Italian food.
LEADMALE:Lucky for you you carry a gun.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me? The last three days with you have really been fun.
LEADMALE:Hi, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Hi, Al.
SUPMALE:You hear anything on the wiretap yet? Save your breath.
LEADFEMALE:He can't hear a word.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Yeah.
SUPMALE:I've been entertaining myself all afternoon.
SUPMALE:Watch.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you dumb Bacciagaloop.
LEADFEMALE:Your face looks like the rear end of a donkey.
SUPFEMALE:This kills me.
LEADFEMALE:You try it.
LEADMALE:No, I will not! I don't think you should talk to him like that either.
LEADMALE:He's practically your daughter's boyfriend.
LEADMALE:What? They hate each other.
LEADMALE:They fight all the time.
LEADMALE:Very passionate fights.
SUPMALE:It has all the signs of a classic lovelhate relationship.
OTHERFEMALE:From the sparks of that conflict rise the flames of desire.
LEADMALE:Flames that ignite in an uncontrollable frenzy of lust, passion and ecstasy.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Where was I? Oh, I don't believe this.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Dick Tracy
LEADMALE:What's your problem now? I said move this someplace else where it would not be in the way.
SUPMALE:I said I'd try.
SUPMALE:I tried.
OTHERMALE:Would you also try to remember to put down the toilet seat after you use it? Sorry, that was me.
SUPFEMALE:I was experimenting with something but it didn't work out.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, he's only trying to do his job.
SUPFEMALE:It can't be very pleasant for him either.
OTHERMALE:As far as stakeouts go, it's nice.
LEADMALE:I thought you couldn't hear with those on.
SUPFEMALE:I do that for Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:She likes calling me names, so I let her.
LEADMALE:She's really a sweet lady.
OTHERFEMALE:She just doesn't like to show it.
LEADFEMALE:Is that a family trait?
LEADMALE: You won't believe what happened to me at the store.
LEADFEMALE:I saw the McDowells.
LEADMALE:Luckily, they didn't see me, so I followed them through the store and I wrote down everything they bought.
LEADFEMALE:Why? For evidence, silly! Rose, they steal jewels, not Geno's pizza rolls.
LEADMALE:Ladies, listen to me now.
LEADFEMALE:I know it seems like we're in this together, but they're dangerous.
LEADMALE:Leave the police work to us.
LEADMALE:Ready for a break, Al? Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get some fresh air.
SUPFEMALE:Won't the neighbors see you? A gentleman visitor.
LEADFEMALE:But it'd look better with one of you.
SUPMALE:Come on, Dotty.
SUPFEMALE:"Come on"? If you want me to do you a favor, ask me.
LEADMALE:OK, don't bite my head off!
LEADMALE:You're a real charmer!
LEADFEMALE:Who are you? Lady Di? Do me a favor and join the bomb squad.
LEADMALE:Oh, God, I am crazy nuts about this guy!  Hi, Rose.
LEADFEMALE: It's Martha McDowell, your new neighbor.
OTHERMALE: I was here for dinner, and yesterday you followed me
SUPMALE:around the supermarket.
LEADMALE: Oh, my God! Why, Dorothy, look, it's, uh it's Mrs.
LEADMALE:McDowell.
LEADMALE:Why is everyone staring at me?
OTHERFEMALE:Your handbag and shoes clash.
SUPMALE:We're a very fashion-conscious neighborhood.
LEADFEMALE:It's short notice, but would you like to come to dinner tomorrow?  Oh, hello.
SUPMALE:We haven't met.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Martha McDowell from next door.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Martha.
LEADMALE:You've met my son Alfonso and my grandson Bobby.
SUPMALE:They're here from New York on a fishing trip.
LEADFEMALE:All they've caught is a cold.
LEADMALE: Nice touch, but I work alone.
LEADMALE:Listen, I've got to run.
SUPFEMALE:You let me know about dinner tomorrow night.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you, Sophia.
OTHERFEMALE:That was quick thinking.
SUPFEMALE:No big deal.
SUPMALE:I mistake a lot of people for my grandson.
SUPMALE:She invited you to dinner?
OTHERMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Al
LEADMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:It's too dangerous.
SUPMALE:We can break the case open.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? We need a bug in their house.
LEADMALE:Bobby, it's not their job.
LEADMALE:We've got zip on the phone.
LEADMALE:They're too smart.
LEADFEMALE:To get a warrant, we need a bug.
SUPMALE:I'll do it.
OTHERMALE:I'll be the plant.
SUPFEMALE:You are a plant.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, honey, you don't do too well under pressure.
LEADMALE:Remember the time in the coffee shop when you didn't have enough money? You ran into the ladies' and tried to climb out through the skylight.
OTHERMALE:That doesn't happen anymore, since I switched to decaf.
LEADMALE:I would volunteer, but I'd be too conspicuous.
LEADMALE:It's a dinner party and I plan to show cleavage.
SUPFEMALE:If anybody does it, it should be me.
SUPMALE:Why you?
SUPMALE:I am the best under pressure.
LEADFEMALE:And she bears a striking resemblance to Barnaby Jones.
SUPMALE:You've been tossing and turning all night.
LEADFEMALE:What's bothering you?
SUPMALE:Nothing, nothing.
SUPMALE:Don't you break a commandment.
LEADMALE:What commandment? Thou shalt not toss and turn?
SUPFEMALE:No, thou shalt not lie.
SUPFEMALE:That's not a commandment.
SUPMALE:Really? That doesn't make any sense.
SUPFEMALE:There's, "thou shalt not commit adultery," "thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.
LEADFEMALE:" Two refer to hitting the sheets, and they couldn't fit in lying? Does anybody think before they write this down? You're not making sense.
LEADMALE:I can't talk to you when you're half asleep.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, it's 4am.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you get a hose and whack me around until I'm razor-sharp? Ma, I have a problem.
LEADFEMALE:I'm worried about tomorrow.
LEADMALE:I don't know whether or not I should go on that mission.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, for 50 years you've told me your problems.
SUPMALE:Who should I take to the prom? Should I marry Stan? These were things I could help you with.
LEADMALE:"Should I go on this mission?" is not my area of expertise.
LEADFEMALE:Who am I, Oliver North? You're not making this any easier.
OTHERMALE:All right, if you think it'll help land this Al character, do it.
LEADMALE:Al? Who said anything about landing Al? Do you think I'd risk my life for Al? I'm doing this because I think it's right.
LEADMALE:Because I'm a concerned citizen.
SUPMALE:And I'd give my right arm to land Al! I'm scared.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:Your problem isn't unique.
OTHERFEMALE:People do crazy things for love all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Let me tell you a story.
OTHERMALE:Picture 
SUPMALE:Sicily, August 1908.
SUPFEMALE:No, that's not it.
LEADMALE:But if you ever need a story about jealousy, this is a pip.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, just go to sleep.
LEADMALE:No, I remember.
SUPFEMALE:Havana, 1957.
LEADMALE:No, I was never in Havana.
LEADFEMALE:Ma!
LEADMALE:I meant Brooklyn, 1958.
OTHERMALE:No, that's not it.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't believe it.
SUPMALE:I'm dry! I got nothing!
LEADFEMALE:It's OK, Ma.
LEADMALE:No, it's not.
LEADMALE:Tommy Lasorda should be standing by the bed, waving to the bullpen.
LEADMALE:Ma, don't let it bother you.
LEADMALE:I just can't leave you hanging.
SUPFEMALE:Would you settle for a very wise observation? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Al's a good guy, and he makes you happy.
LEADMALE:If you're doing it for that alone, it's worth it.
LEADMALE:You're also doing it because you feel it's the right thing.
SUPMALE:Thanks, Ma.
LEADMALE:That means a lot to me.
LEADMALE:Good.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, get some rest, pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:Tomorrow could be your last day.
SUPFEMALE:It's a shame we have to go to the McDowells' tonight.
SUPMALE:There's a great movie on TV.
SUPFEMALE:What? In Cold Blood.
LEADFEMALE:It's about This innocent family is brutally murdered
LEADFEMALE:May I see that, Rose?
OTHERFEMALE:Sure.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Rose, we're nervous enough about going over.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have to make it worse? Well, it's nothing to be nervous about.
SUPMALE:Bobby and Al are watching through the window the whole time.
LEADMALE:If we get in trouble, we just signal them.
SUPMALE:How are we doing, ladies? To be honest, we're a little nervous.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Let's go over the plan once more.
SUPMALE:Check.
LEADFEMALE:At 1800 hours, we enter the suspects' domicile.
LEADFEMALE:At 1830 hours, we sit down to dinner.
SUPFEMALE:After wine is poured at approximately 1840 hours, I begin telling the story about Uncle Hertis and the skunks,
SUPFEMALE:which should last about
LEADFEMALE:1900 hours.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, here's the transmitter.
LEADMALE:Keep it in your hand.
LEADMALE:Then, with one quick movement, stick it under the table.
OTHERMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:All right, so, any other questions? Well, I guess that's it.
SUPMALE:Good luck.
SUPMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Ma, you're not going.
LEADMALE:I am.
LEADMALE:If anything goes wrong,
SUPFEMALE:you need someone experienced.
SUPFEMALE:In what? Life.
SUPFEMALE:You're looking at a woman who lived through two wars, 15 vendettas, four operations and two Darrins on Bewitched.
LEADMALE:I don't think those are very good reasons to go.
SUPMALE:No? How about this one? I'm hungry.
SUPMALE:Let's roll, Danno.
OTHERMALE:Al All right, that's the front door closing.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, the ladies are out of the house.
LEADFEMALE:The transmitter's working perfectly.
SUPFEMALE:Clear as a bell.
SUPFEMALE:They did it.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:I had doubts about this one.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:Great job.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:It's really working?
OTHERMALE:Give her the phones.
LEADFEMALE:I hate to say this, but it was almost fun.
LEADFEMALE:Fun? My pulse was racing, my heart was pounding! I could barely get my breath! That's the most fun I've ever had standing up! No, I take it back.
LEADMALE:There was that one time on that 74 7.
LEADFEMALE:They keep talking about the noodle-head in the red dress.
LEADFEMALE:Could that be code? Only to the noodle-head in the red dress.
LEADFEMALE:OK, what happens next? We should get enough to get warrants and be out of your lives by tomorrow.
LEADMALE:I'm beat.
SUPMALE:I'm going to bed.
LEADFEMALE:Me too.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, I'm too excited to sleep!
OTHERFEMALE:You're not.
SUPFEMALE:You're beat too.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm beat too.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm so beat, I won't be able to hear a thing that goes on.
SUPFEMALE:But I'd like to hear about it tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Give me the earphones.
SUPFEMALE:Get some rest.
OTHERMALE:OK, Al.
LEADMALE:Hey, Dorothy, I just wanna say you did a nice job.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Al.
LEADMALE:And Dorothy I also wanted to say it took guts.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, Al.
SUPFEMALE:You see, Dorothy, I just wanted to ask you I wanted to ask you  For God's sakes, he wants to ask you to go out with him! You got your listening equipment, I got mine.
LEADMALE: Good night.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Come in.
LEADFEMALE:Bobby, here's those extra towels you asked for, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Blanche.
LEADMALE:You're welcome.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, thank you for everything you've done the past few days.
LEADMALE:You don't have to thank me for anything.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, I kind of enjoyed doing it.
SUPMALE:You remind me a lot of my son, Matthew, except he doesn't carry a gun.
LEADMALE:Bobby, does your momma know you carry that gun? Blanche, I'm a grown man.
LEADFEMALE:I don't need her permission.
SUPMALE:Although, to be honest, she's not thrilled about it.
LEADFEMALE:That's because she loves you.
LEADFEMALE:I'd be a nervous wreck if Matthew were a police officer.
LEADMALE:I worry about him enough, and he's a CPA.
LEADFEMALE:I guess that's just a mother's nature.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll see you in the morning.
LEADMALE:Hey, Blanche, listen, uh My mom's in Oregon.
LEADMALE:I don't get a home-cooked meal too often.
SUPFEMALE:OK if I stop by sometime? I think that would be great.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care how old you think you are
LEADMALE:it's light's out.
SUPMALE:Yes, ma'am.
LEADMALE:OK.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Good night.
OTHERMALE:Bobby, let's go! The exchange is going down! Move it!
SUPMALE:What's going on?
SUPMALE:It's the McDowells.
SUPFEMALE:Get on the floor and stay there! Now! 
LEADMALE:I'm scared!
SUPFEMALE:I'm scared too! I'm scared for Al and Bobby.
SUPFEMALE:Shh! What was that noise?
SUPMALE:That was me.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for calling it to everyone's attention.
OTHERMALE:Oh What's happening out there?
SUPFEMALE:Shut up.
LEADMALE:I hear something.
LEADMALE:I don't.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Gunshots! Oh, sweet Jesus! That could have been Al! We have to do something.
LEADFEMALE:We have to wait till he comes back.
SUPMALE:What if he can't come back?
LEADMALE: Thank God you're OK!
OTHERFEMALE:Is everything OK? Just stay down.
SUPFEMALE:It's Mullins.
LEADMALE:I need an ambulance at the stakeout.
LEADFEMALE:My partner's shot.
LEADMALE: Oh! Yeah, at first I was really scared, but then I realized it was a shoulder wound and calmed down.
LEADMALE:Actually, I passed out.
LEADFEMALE:But I did it calmly.
SUPMALE:Bobby, you're so brave.
LEADMALE:You're so stupid! You're supposed to duck a bullet.
LEADMALE:In Sicily, you don't pass kindergarten till you learn that.
LEADFEMALE:Really? In St.
SUPFEMALE:Olaf, we just had to promise not to eat paste.
SUPMALE:All right, ladies, let's not baby him.
SUPMALE:Al, how are you doing?
SUPMALE:Great.
OTHERMALE:The DA will put away the McDowells for a long time.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, who's going to look after their lawn? Rose, while we're here, maybe you should have a CAT scan.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Bobby, out of bed.
SUPMALE:You've got to go out to the sun deck.
OTHERFEMALE:Who wants to drive?
LEADMALE:I'll do it.
LEADMALE:It's nice not to be a passenger for a change.
LEADMALE:I want you to tell me the whole story from the beginning.
LEADFEMALE:From the time that you left Dorothy I want to ask you something.
LEADFEMALE:How about you and I go out sometime, huh? Dorothy, I want to see you again.
LEADFEMALE:I want to see you again too.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:But I can't.
OTHERFEMALE:Why not? Because I could get serious about you.
SUPFEMALE:I don't get it.
OTHERMALE:Al, until the other night, I thought this whole thing was a game, but after what happened, I realized it isn't.
LEADFEMALE:You don't want to become involved with someone who could get hurt.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, Al.
OTHERMALE:It's not the first time I've heard it.
SUPFEMALE:I understand.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:You take good care of yourself, you hear? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:So, are you two an item?
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:No, we decided it was best
LEADMALE:if we didn't see each other.
SUPMALE:Are you sure, Dorothy?
LEADMALE:In your heart, are you sure?
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, Ma.
LEADMALE:Fine, then I want you to meet someone.
SUPFEMALE:Dr.
OTHERMALE:Tansy This is my daughter.
SUPMALE:And this guy is nobody.
LEADMALE:Beat it, Al.
SUPFEMALE:
