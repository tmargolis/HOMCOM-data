LEADMALE:I taught a class today - the finest school in Dade County.
LEADMALE:Two girls had shaved heads and three boys had green hair.
LEADMALE:They're expressing themselves.
SUPMALE:Well, I expressed myself.
OTHERMALE:I told them they had to leave.
SUPFEMALE:They were too ugly to look at.
LEADFEMALE:Now the parents are mad.
LEADMALE:A father came in in a three-piece suit and defended Tiffany, a bald girl with a nose ring.
SUPFEMALE:What's that? - Enchiladas rancheros.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you just shoot me? - Hi.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Rose.
LEADMALE:What a day.
OTHERMALE:One sad person after another.
LEADMALE:Rose, you work at grief counseling.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you expect, comedians? Well, it would be a change of pace.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, can I borrow your mink stole? It's Miami in June - only cats are wearing fur.
SUPMALE:You going out? - No, no.
LEADMALE:She's gonna sit here where it's I just need some cucumbers to put on my eyes.
SUPMALE:You'll have trouble seeing, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:It's very good.
LEADMALE:It reduces puffiness.
LEADMALE:Does it work on thighs? I don't know, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I don't need it on my thighs.
SUPFEMALE:Who's she going out with? - Harry again.
SUPMALE:Harry? Who is this Harry? All Blanche said was he still has his own teeth and hair.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it is wonderful dating in Miami.
SUPMALE:All the single men under 80 are cocaine smugglers.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'd kill to be 20 again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I would kill to be 40 again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh You know, I had the shock of my life today.
LEADMALE:I was in the teacher's lounge, talking to a group of girls in their twenties.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, they were so pretty.
LEADMALE:At that age, you don't even have to be pretty and you're pretty.
LEADFEMALE:We were laughing and giggling and having a great time and I completely forgot that I was older.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I just felt like one of the girls.
LEADFEMALE:And we had a wonderful time.
LEADFEMALE:And then I got into my car and caught a glimpse of myself, and I almost had a heart attack.
LEADFEMALE:This old woman was in the mirror.
LEADMALE:I didn't even recognize her.
SUPMALE:Who was it? - It was me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh, Rose, I'm borrowing your earrings.
OTHERMALE:Lord, I'd love to get a face-lift by 8:00.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, who is Harry? Oh, girls, he's just wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:He's very gallant, he's a perfect gentleman, he's a great dancer.
LEADFEMALE:And he doesn't make noises when he chews.
SUPMALE:Chewing - that's way up there on my list.
SUPMALE:Comes right after intelligent.
SUPFEMALE:He doesn't talk loud at the movies, doesn't take his own pulse, and he's still interested.
LEADFEMALE:In what? Rose, if you have to ask, it does not matter anymore.
SUPMALE:And he proposed.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, wait a minute! He proposed? You've only known him a week! - And he wants an answer tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Tonight? Ton What are you gonna tell him? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:He's very wonderful, but I have only known him for a week.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:But I don't want to lose him.
OTHERMALE:Girls, I just don't know what I'm gonna tell him.
LEADFEMALE:I have to go put on my face.
LEADFEMALE:What if she marries him? What'll happen to us? - This house is hers.
SUPMALE:Then we'll move.
LEADFEMALE:We can't afford to buy a house.
LEADMALE:What do we have for collateral? A gay cook? Oh, come on, Rose.
SUPMALE:Nobody is getting married.
LEADFEMALE:Now, let's go talk to Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, we'll become bag ladies! - Blanche? - Come in.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, Blanche, your friend Harry wants an answer tonight.
LEADFEMALE:What are you gonna tell him? I haven't decided.
OTHERMALE:I guess I'll know when I hear it come out of my mouth.
SUPMALE:You'll know when you hear it come out of your mouth? This isn't a belch, Blanche.
LEADMALE:This is marriage! Will you look at this? She has more colors than Benjamin Moore Paints.
LEADMALE:You mustn't rush into anything, Blanche.
LEADMALE:You hardly know him.
SUPMALE:I just wonder what my husband George would think about me and Harry.
LEADMALE:Well, if he was alive, he probably would not like it.
LEADFEMALE:But since he's dead, I don't think it poses a problem.
LEADMALE:I just want him to know that I'm happy, but that I could never be as happy with Harry in the same way as I was with him.
SUPMALE:He knows, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:He knows.
LEADFEMALE:Your thoughts and feelings go right to him.
LEADMALE:You can communicate directly from your heart.
LEADFEMALE:Can't you, Dorothy? Oh, don't ask me.
OTHERMALE:I can't get through to New Jersey with MCI.
SUPFEMALE:That's him.
LEADMALE:He's early.
SUPMALE:I haven't finished my face.
LEADMALE:The only thing left is to dip it in bronze.
LEADMALE:We'll get it.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:I wonder what he looks like.
LEADMALE:I hope he doesn't have hair in his ears.
SUPFEMALE:Hi there.
LEADMALE:Ma! - Ma, what's the matter? - Everyone is fine.
OTHERFEMALE:No one died.
SUPMALE:The home burned down.
LEADMALE:My God, are you all right? - How'd you get here? - I hitched.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma! - A cab.
OTHERMALE:I took a cab.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you should've called.
LEADFEMALE:I'm perfectly capable of managing by myself.
LEADMALE:I don't need help.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a totally independent person.
LEADFEMALE:I know, I know.
LEADMALE:I need $67 for the cab.
OTHERFEMALE:$67? Ma, Ma, this is crazy.
OTHERMALE:The home is 15 minutes from here.
LEADMALE:My cab driver is Cuban.
LEADMALE:He said there was an additional tax for a bilingual driver.
SUPMALE:I'll take care of him.
OTHERMALE:Sit down, Sophia.
LEADMALE:You must be exhausted.
OTHERMALE:Why? I rode in the cab.
SUPMALE:I didn't push it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Sophia, honey! How nice to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Who are you? - It's me, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:You look like a prostitute.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, the things you say! She didn't mean that, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Of course I mean it.
LEADMALE:Look at her.
LEADMALE:My cab driver would fall in love.
SUPMALE:Can I get something to eat, or is the fancy man in the kitchen? - The way she talks! - She can't help it.
SUPMALE:Oh, I've known plenty of women who have had strokes.
LEADMALE:Some of them were in very bad shape, but they're still ladies.
LEADMALE:But this stroke destroyed the part of her brain that censors what she says.
OTHERMALE:She just says whatever she thinks.
SUPFEMALE:She can't help it.
SUPFEMALE:He's an OK petunia.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, Ma, the cab driver said you promised him a $67 tip! Don't be silly.
OTHERFEMALE:I said a six, seven dollar tip.
LEADMALE:Why don't these people learn English if they're gonna live here? This is Miami.
SUPMALE:I'd have less trouble getting around Ecuador.
LEADMALE:(doorbell - Oh, I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Harry, hi! - Ah, my pretty.
SUPMALE:Oh, Harry.
LEADMALE:Everybody, this is Harry.
LEADMALE:Harry, this is Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Rose.
SUPFEMALE:And Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:Hi, Harry.
LEADMALE:And this is Sophia.
LEADMALE:Well, you must be Blanche's sister.
LEADMALE:You must be blind.
LEADMALE:Sophia's home just burned down.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's terrible! Not to me.
SUPFEMALE:It was a retirement home, and you know what they did? They set off the fire alarm in a retirement home.
SUPFEMALE:Who can rush? Half the people have walkers, the other half can't get out of their chairs.
SUPFEMALE:But they got bells going off like crazy.
SUPFEMALE:You know what that does to hearts that only beat a few times a week? It's not pretty.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, we'd better go.
LEADMALE:We have reservations.
LEADFEMALE:I hope he's taking you to a cold climate.
SUPMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:It was a pleasure.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice meeting you, Harry.
LEADFEMALE:Have fun! The man is a scuzzball.
LEADFEMALE:This is so sad.
SUPFEMALE:We were all so lonely and then by a miracle we found each other.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, we both answered an ad to share Blanche's house that we found in the supermarket.
OTHERFEMALE:It was not the resurrection.
SUPFEMALE:It is hardly a miracle.
SUPMALE:To me it was a miracle because we're happy.
SUPFEMALE:It's not fair, you know.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we get married, we have kids, the kids leave, and our husbands die.
LEADMALE:Is that some kind of a test? You don't work that hard, you don't go through everything you go through to be left alone.
OTHERMALE:We are alone, Dorothy, we really are.
SUPMALE:Our families are gone and we're alone.
LEADFEMALE:And there are too many years left, and I don't know what to do.
SUPMALE:Get a poodle.
SUPFEMALE:It's yes.
SUPMALE:I know it is.
LEADFEMALE:She's gonna marry him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Rose.
SUPMALE:She can't help it.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche needs a man.
SUPMALE:She told me, when George died, she made a date at the funeral.
SUPMALE:Oh, not that she didn't love George.
SUPMALE:She can't be without a man.
SUPMALE:You know what I'm saying? What am I doing up? I'm subbing for a teacher who was shot by a student.
SUPMALE:I need all the sleep I can get.
LEADMALE:I used to sleep so well.
LEADMALE:I never even turned over.
LEADFEMALE:I'd wake up with a perfect hairdo.
OTHERMALE:Charlie, on the other hand, moves all night long.
LEADMALE:His side of the bed looks like a murder took place.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, Charlie is dead.
LEADMALE:Why tell her? Coco, it's 15 years! I know he's dead.
LEADMALE:I'm not crazy.
SUPFEMALE:I just like to talk about him in the present tense sometimes.
OTHERMALE:It makes him seem closer.
SUPMALE:That's fine, Rose.
LEADMALE:You do that.
LEADMALE:I don't mind at all.
LEADMALE:Sure, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Set a place at the table.
OTHERMALE:Well, hi! - What happened? Oh, we had the nicest time.
LEADMALE:We went to Joe's.
SUPMALE:You ever been to Joe's? - Yes.
SUPFEMALE:What happened? - I had the stone crabs.
LEADFEMALE:I never had stone crabs.
LEADMALE:You ever have stone crabs? Yes, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Just tell us.
SUPFEMALE:I was just so relieved they didn't have eyes.
LEADMALE:I can't eat anything with eyes, like lobster.
LEADFEMALE:I can't eat anything that moves.
SUPFEMALE:Like what, Rose? Horses? - Like oysters.
LEADFEMALE:Oysters don't move! Coco, they could dance! Who cares? - Tell us.
SUPFEMALE:Oysters move! Very slowly.
SUPFEMALE:You have to watch very closely.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, are you gonna marry Harry? - Marry Harry, marry Harry.
LEADMALE:A little rhyme.
LEADMALE:Knock it off.
SUPMALE:Are you? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Next week.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it.
LEADMALE:I knew she was gonna marry him.
OTHERMALE:But next week? At our age, long engagements don't make sense.
LEADMALE:I have to go to bed.
SUPMALE:Where will you live? - Well, here.
SUPMALE:Where will we live? - Oh, don't worry.
LEADMALE:We'll live, we'll live.
LEADMALE:Oh, I hadn't thought of that.
LEADMALE:It's so hard to find a place to live.
OTHERMALE:Well, you can just stay right here.
SUPMALE:Well, that's settled.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose! How could we stay here with Blanche and Harry? - She just said! - You certainly can until you find a place.
LEADFEMALE:However long that takes.
LEADMALE:We're going to New York for the honeymoon.
OTHERMALE:I just hope I don't get murdered.
LEADMALE:Charlie and I waited two whole years before we got married.
LEADMALE:I got married before my father finished the sentence.
SUPMALE:You married your father? My father told Stan that he had to marry me.
LEADMALE:I was pregnant.
LEADMALE:You had a blowgun wedding? If you live in the Amazon.
LEADMALE:In Queens, it's called "shotgun.
LEADFEMALE:" Maybe that's why he left - because you forced him into it.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, he left me 38 years later.
SUPMALE:For a stewardess that he met on a business trip to Hawaii.
LEADFEMALE:It was her first flight.
SUPMALE:They said, "On arrival, give the passengers a lei.
LEADMALE:" She got confused He got lucky, and they now live on Maui.
LEADFEMALE:It's really wonderful.
LEADMALE:A 65-year-old man with gout learning to windsurf.
SUPFEMALE:I hope he trips on his thongs and falls into a volcano.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's you.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Sophia, did we wake you? I heard noise.
LEADFEMALE:I thought it was robbers, so I hid my jewels.
LEADMALE:Now I can't remember where.
LEADMALE:Ma, you don't have any jewels.
LEADFEMALE:Thank God, because I can't find them.
LEADFEMALE:Tea, Sophia? How about a shot of gin with a beer back? That was dumb of me to have tea this late.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go to sleep and have to get up to go.
SUPFEMALE:And wake me up.
SUPFEMALE:You know, if you didn't drink before bedtime, you wouldn't have to wake up in the middle of the night.
LEADFEMALE:I don't drink before bedtime.
OTHERMALE:I stop all liquids at noon and I still wake up.
SUPFEMALE:I never have that problem - never.
LEADMALE:I sleep like a log.
LEADMALE:I never get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:I go in the morning.
LEADMALE:Every morning like clockwork.
LEADFEMALE:At 7 am, I pee.
LEADFEMALE:Unfortunately, I don't wake up till 8:00.
LEADFEMALE:Where's Blanche? - In the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:I've gotta talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:What is it? I know this sounds crazy, but I'm suspicious.
LEADMALE:Of what? - Harry.
SUPMALE:Harry? - And I don't know why.
LEADFEMALE:There's just something about it I don't like, and I have to tell Blanche.
LEADMALE:Tell Blanche what? - That she can't marry him! The wedding is in 12 minutes! You can't tell her that.
LEADFEMALE:I owe it to her.
LEADFEMALE:I'm her friend.
SUPMALE:But there's nothing to tell her.
LEADFEMALE:This is just some crazy hunch.
LEADMALE:My hunches are never wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Gandhi would be alive today if she had taken my call.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna tell her.
SUPFEMALE:You are not.
SUPMALE:I will not let you.
LEADFEMALE:I can't stop crying.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm so happy and so sad.
LEADFEMALE:Kind of a happy sad.
LEADFEMALE:Speaking of sad, Blanche - Shut up, Rose.
LEADMALE:She's crying already.
LEADFEMALE:What's the difference? Rose, pick that up.
LEADFEMALE:I just can't believe it.
LEADMALE:I'm getting married! - What do you think about that? - I think it's a mistake.
OTHERFEMALE:To wear all that makeup.
LEADMALE:I know it's fast, but I just don't know when I'll find another like him.
LEADFEMALE:He just Oh, girls, girls, he makes me feel so good, so young, so happy.
LEADMALE:Aw.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, did you hear that? So happy.
LEADMALE:Now I have to go to the bathroom again.
LEADFEMALE:When I get nervous, I have to go all the time.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I'm getting married here at the house.
LEADFEMALE:Public bathrooms are so difficult for me.
SUPFEMALE:I wash my hands so thoroughly, and then I find it so hard to get out again without touching the doorknob.
LEADFEMALE:Don't! - Be too long! Rose, that is a happy woman in there.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I want you to promise that you will not say anything.
LEADMALE:Do you promise? Are you sure? Well, what's got me so sad Ohh Oh, I just I just never, never had two better friends.
SUPMALE:I just can't stand the thought of leaving you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, you look gorgeous.
LEADMALE:Oh! Shut up, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Are you ready? - Yes, I guess.
SUPMALE:Stop! (thud - The minister's here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I need perfume.
LEADFEMALE:Perfume, perfume.
LEADMALE:Come on, let's go.
SUPMALE:He's a half-hour late.
LEADFEMALE:He probably got caught in traffic.
SUPMALE:Ladies, I'm on a tight schedule.
LEADFEMALE:This is Miami.
SUPFEMALE:I've got funerals backed up.
SUPFEMALE:Give us a few minutes, please.
SUPFEMALE:Five minutes more, then I've got to bury Mr.
LEADMALE:Pinkus.
SUPMALE:(doorbell - You see? - Is there a Blanche Hollingsworth here? - God, he's been killed.
LEADMALE:Arrested.
OTHERFEMALE:What? He gave me this to give to you.
SUPFEMALE:He's a bigamist, ma'am.
SUPMALE:He's wanted in four states.
LEADMALE:He's got six wives.
LEADFEMALE:You got yourself mixed up with a real hustler.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you won't be needing me today.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, do you want to read the note? Do you want me to read it to you? "Dear Blanche, I guess you know by now.
LEADMALE:"I'm really sorry.
LEADFEMALE:"The thing is, I really liked you.
SUPFEMALE:"This time was different.
LEADFEMALE:You're a special lady.
LEADMALE:Maybe someday you'll write to me.
SUPFEMALE:Harry.
LEADMALE:" Oh, God.
LEADFEMALE:I'm stunned.
OTHERMALE:I'm just stunned.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I feel like such an old fool.
SUPMALE:Not just a fool, but an old fool.
SUPFEMALE:My God, I just wanna die.
LEADMALE:You're not a fool, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:You're a beautiful, loving, trusting woman.
SUPMALE:There's no fool here, Blanche.
SUPMALE:I guess maybe I'm hoping the shock will be too much for my heart and I'll just drop dead right here.
LEADMALE:And the minister can bury me with Mr.
OTHERMALE:Pinkus.
SUPFEMALE:I won't have to look anyone in the eye ever again.
LEADMALE:Except maybe Mr.
LEADMALE:Pinkus.
LEADMALE:If I meet our paperboy, he will not live to be a paper man.
LEADFEMALE:Florida is having a drought.
LEADMALE:In the entire state, there is not enough water to make a cup of tea.
OTHERMALE:He finds a puddle.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? She's sleeping.
LEADMALE:Just checking.
LEADMALE:You never know.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me, how is Blanche? She didn't go to work again today.
OTHERFEMALE:It's been three weeks and she just sits in her room.
SUPMALE:The museum's gonna fire her.
SUPMALE:Well, we've tried everything - golf, the movies, theater tickets.
SUPMALE:She wouldn't even budge for Julio Iglesias.
LEADMALE:I know grief.
LEADFEMALE:It takes time.
SUPFEMALE:Please, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, if you're Irish, you have a wake.
LEADFEMALE:You eat, you cry, you drink, you vomit, and you're done.
SUPMALE:If you're Jewish, you cry, you sit, you eat for seven days, you put on ten pounds, and it's over.
SUPFEMALE:We Italians scream, dress up a donkey, hire a band, and that's that.
OTHERMALE:It's these southern Protestants who make it a way of life.
SUPMALE:When I go, put me in a steel sack and leave me on the curb next to the cans.
SUPMALE:We thought you were asleep.
LEADFEMALE:You never know.
LEADMALE:You girls shouldn't sit out here in the sun.
LEADMALE:We've been so worried about you.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so glad you're up.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry if I worried you.
SUPMALE:Aw, sweetheart, how are you? - I'm OK.
SUPFEMALE:I really am.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:At first I wanted to give up, to die, truly.
OTHERMALE:Only time I ever felt worse was when George died.
LEADFEMALE:But then I had the kids with me and I pulled through it.
LEADFEMALE:This time, I thought, "This is my last chance, my last hope for happiness.
SUPMALE:" - I just thought I'd never feel good again.
LEADMALE:How long is this story? I'm 80.
SUPFEMALE:I have to plan.
LEADMALE:This morning I woke up and I was in the shower, shampooing my hair, and I heard humming.
LEADMALE:I thought there was someone in there with me.
SUPMALE:No, it was me.
LEADFEMALE:I was humming.
LEADFEMALE:And humming means I'm feeling good.
LEADFEMALE:And then I realized I was feeling good because of you.
OTHERMALE:You made the difference.
LEADMALE:You're my family, and you make me happy to be alive.
LEADFEMALE:Let's drive to Coconut Grove for lunch.
SUPFEMALE:OK.
SUPFEMALE:My treat.
OTHERMALE:We have to celebrate.
OTHERMALE:What, that she came out of her room? That we're together.
SUPMALE:And that no matter what happens, even if we all get married, we'll stick together.
SUPFEMALE:Then we'll need a much bigger house.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, Rose.
LEADMALE:After lunch, you can pick up the lumber.
LEADMALE:Ma, you want to join us? - Nope.
SUPMALE:I gotta rest.
SUPMALE:I got a date tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Huh? With whom? The fancy man and I are going to the dog track.
LEADFEMALE:Your mother bets? - No, she rides.
LEADFEMALE:She's a dog jockey.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh, great, great, wonderful! My daughter is lost! I'm just terrible at giving directions! - I gave Kate the directions over the phone.
OTHERFEMALE:And who are you, Rand McNally? You couldn't make a mistake? Shall I set this down someplace? No, Rose, go to the corner and open a stand! - Dorothy - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:It's just that I'm so anxious about meeting this guy that Kate's bringing.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think it's serious? Well, they've been together now for six months.
LEADFEMALE:That's the longest she's been interested in any man since Paul McCartney.
SUPMALE:Kate dated Paul McCartney? Yes, Rose.
LEADMALE:They wanted to get engaged, but I insisted that she finish grade school.
LEADMALE:Do you know anything about this boy's family background? - All I know is that he's a doctor.
LEADFEMALE:A doctor! The heck with his background! Do you have any idea how much a doctor makes these days? No, I really don't care what he does for a living.
OTHERMALE:I mean, the important thing is that he and Kate have a good relationship.
LEADMALE:(doorbell 'Course if they happen to get married, I will shout from every rooftop in Miami, "My son-in-law's a doctor!" - Hi, Mom! - Oh, baby! Oh, it is so good to see you! Oh, look everybody, look who's here! - You look glorious! - Where is he? Where's your doctor? Dennis is at a seminar.
SUPFEMALE:I'll bring him by tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:I can't find my culottes! - Grandma, you look sensational! Relax, relax, you're already in the will! Before anyone does anything, I have a big announcement to make.
LEADFEMALE:As my mother has undoubtedly already told you and the rest of Miami, for the past six months, I've been seeing a doctor named Dennis.
OTHERFEMALE:That's your big announcement? You call your doctor by his first name? Ma, Ma, he's her boyfriend.
OTHERMALE:He just happens to be a doctor, OK? Fine! What's the point? The day after tomorrow, Dennis and I are flying to the Bahamas - and we're getting married.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's terrific! - Oh! That's so exciting! - Oh, I can't, I can't believe it! Oh, I am so happy! My daughter is marrying a doctor! In the Bahamas.
LEADMALE:You are getting married in the Bahamas? - This is fabulous.
SUPFEMALE:I always wanted to go to the Bahamas! Now where the hell are my culottes? Oh, Kate, Kate, honey, I have always dreamed of giving you a wedding! Ever since I had your overbite fixed.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you think it would be awkward, with you and Dad not talking? Now just a minute! I am not the one who ran off to Maui with someone half my age and twice my bra size! You see what I mean? That's why we're getting married in the Bahamas.
LEADFEMALE:You are not getting married on an island by a priest wearing clam diggers You'll get married right here in Miami.
OTHERFEMALE:Kate, I could put together a lovely reception here at the house.
LEADMALE:And I could take care of the catering! I have always dreamed of wearing a long, white gown and marching down the aisle on my father's arm.
LEADMALE:Who said anything about inviting your father? It wouldn't be much of a wedding without both of my parents there.
LEADMALE:Even if we got live doves? - Mother! - Oh, all right, honey.
OTHERMALE:Your wedding day should be the most beautiful day of your life.
SUPMALE:And if you want to invite your father, I'm willing to keep the peace.
LEADMALE:Promise? - Promise.
SUPMALE:Then it's settled.
LEADMALE:Now call your father and tell the dirt bag he can come.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it, Mom.
LEADMALE:I can just as easily limbo down the aisle.
SUPMALE:Relax honey.
SUPMALE:I just want to get it all out of my system before he gets here.
LEADFEMALE:Now go ahead, call him.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call him.
LEADMALE:You talk to him.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:If I can get through an entire wedding with him, I should be able to handle a simple phone conversation with that yellow-bellied sleazeball! Hello, Stan? Dorothy Dorothy Zbornak The one who gave you the best years of her thighs.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I'm fine, fine Yeah, it has been a long time.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, you know, after two years, I figured you weren't coming back.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you the reason I'm calling you - Kate is getting married.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, married Yes, yes, in a few days, and I'm giving her a little wedding here in Miami and I wanted to invite you.
LEADFEMALE:Can you come? You can? Great.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Chrissy can't, oh Oh, I'm so sorry Oh, really? No, I didn't know that could happen from a tanning machine.
SUPMALE:Oh, she'll be thrilled to see you too! She's standing right here.
SUPMALE:Hold on.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, you were magnificent! - You certainly were! How did you do it? I just kept telling myself that once he was here, he'd be close enough to kill.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe Stan has the nerve to show his face at this wedding! The man has a right to see his daughter get married! - I never should have called him.
LEADFEMALE:You never should have married him! - Hi, hi, hi! - Oh, hi, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Are my little wedding elves still busy packing their tiny bundles? Wedding elves.
OTHERMALE:It's that cheap hair dye she uses.
LEADMALE:It finally ate through! - No, we're doing fine, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, honey! - You're using too much rice! - Fine! This elf quits! I never understood why people throw rice at weddings anyway.
SUPMALE:Because tomatoes leave stains.
LEADFEMALE:Could I talk to you two ladies in the living room, please? I have some very distressing news.
SUPMALE:Sophia's been pilfering cheese balls.
LEADFEMALE:What? This morning, I made 48 cheese balls.
OTHERFEMALE:There are now 26.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mom! Mom, this is Don't tell me! Don't tell me! It's Dennis! Oh, my God, he's beautiful! - It's a pleasure to meet you.
LEADMALE:Oh, flowers! Oh, my! You know, your father used to bring me tulips every time we had a fight.
LEADFEMALE:Toward the end, our place looked like Easter in Rotterdam.
SUPFEMALE:It's good to see that you're not bitter.
LEADMALE:Everybody, I'd like you to meet my future son-in-law.
LEADFEMALE:This is Dennis, the gorgeous doctor! Dennis, I'd like you to meet my best friends.
SUPMALE:This is Rose.
SUPMALE:Hello, Rose.
LEADMALE:That's Blanche.
LEADMALE:How do you do? And that's Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:That's Kate's grandma.
LEADMALE:You got your stethoscope? I wouldn't mind a freebie! Grandma, Dennis doesn't have a stethoscope.
LEADFEMALE:Of course not.
LEADMALE:He's on vacation! That's not what I mean - Dennis is a podiatrist.
LEADMALE:Oh, oh, a foot doctor.
LEADMALE:Ah, why don't we all sit down.
OTHERFEMALE:Not there, not there.
LEADMALE:Oh Well, a podiatrist.
LEADMALE:Well, that's a very fascinating profession.
LEADMALE:Tell me, Dennis, approximately how many feet do you see in a week? Between my partners and me, we see quite a few.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's a partnership.
LEADFEMALE:Have you ever met Dr.
LEADMALE:Scholl? Let's get to the point! What do you take home a week? Ma! It's all right, I understand.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, I am crazy about Kate and I promise you she will never want for anything.
SUPMALE:Oh! I told you he was special.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think Dad'll like him? Of course! As long as he stays young and firm.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dennis, it's going to be a pleasure welcoming you into our little family! And I just hope that you and Kate have all the happiness in the world! Me too.
SUPMALE:And maybe one of your children will be a real doctor! (doorbell Hi, it was really (doorbell Dorothy, it's Stan.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't you recognize me? Of course I recognized you.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I slammed the door in your face.
LEADFEMALE:Still the jokester, huh? - Yes.
LEADMALE:And speaking of jokes, Stan, that is some toupee you've got.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like you to meet my ex-husband, Stan Zbornak.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:And this is his hair.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a pleasure to meet you both.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Who invited Donny Osmond? - Ma, this is Stan.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Sophia.
LEADMALE:It's the hair.
LEADMALE:It makes me look different.
LEADFEMALE:It makes you look stupid.
LEADMALE:Oh, hello there.
SUPMALE:Stan, I'd like you to meet my friend Blanche.
LEADMALE:Charmed.
LEADMALE:Daddy? - Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Hello, princess! - Oh, you look absolutely beautiful! - I'm so glad you're here! - Thank you for coming.
LEADMALE:Don't thank me.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank your mother.
OTHERFEMALE:There aren't too many women around who could swallow their pride after what went down between us.
SUPMALE:You're awesome, babe.
LEADMALE:Absolutely awesome.
SUPMALE:Shh! We better get to the church.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you think so? - Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Uh Grandma, why don't you come with me and Daddy.
LEADMALE:Come on, Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:It'll be fun.
LEADFEMALE:We can catch up with old times.
LEADMALE:No, we can't.
LEADMALE:I had a stroke.
LEADFEMALE:Luckily, my memories of you were wiped out! - See ya.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, are you all right? Oh, she's a trouper.
LEADMALE:She'll be fine.
LEADFEMALE:Won't you, Dorothy? Not until I taste his blood! Now, you don't mean that.
LEADMALE:I want you to take a deep breath and think pleasant thoughts.
LEADMALE:Come on, now.
LEADMALE:One, two, three.
LEADMALE:I'm not going! Dorothy! Your daughter's getting married! I cannot be in the same room with him! I know I'll do something crazy and just ruin the whole wedding! Blanche and I'll be right beside you.
LEADMALE:Nothing can happen.
LEADMALE:I cannot do it! - All right! I've heard enough! We are talking about your daughter's wedding, Dorothy Zbornak! Now you get on your feet, get out that door! March! Oh, all right.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I'm going.
OTHERFEMALE:But if anything awful happens, it's on your heads! Oh, she's really upset.
LEADFEMALE:We better keep an eye on her.
SUPMALE:You're right.
OTHERMALE:We better stick to her like a tight shirt on a sweaty farmhand! You know the type, with the big biceps and the hairy chest, just glistening in the hot sun I'm sorry, what were we talking about? - Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dorothy! Oh, that's right! I'm not saying this because she is my daughter, but she was the best Abraham Lincoln the third grade ever saw.
SUPFEMALE:No, when she freed the second grade, there was not a dry eye in the house.
SUPMALE:Somehow I just can't picture Kate as Abraham Lincoln.
SUPMALE:Oh, Stan, do me a favor? Take off your hair and hold it up to Kate's chin.
SUPMALE:Mother, you promised! - I know, I know.
LEADMALE:Just ignore me, Stan.
SUPFEMALE:It should be easy.
LEADMALE:You've had plenty of practice.
OTHERFEMALE:Princess, before I forget, I want to invite you and Dennis to come spend some time with Chrissy and me in our new house in Maui.
OTHERMALE:That sounds great! - Yeah, yeah, it's primo! Listen, I have some pictures.
LEADFEMALE:Take a look at that stretch of beach, huh? That's our house.
LEADFEMALE:That's Chrissy on a new Hobie Cat.
SUPMALE:That's Chrissy in a hot tub.
OTHERMALE:That's me and Chrissy at a luau.
SUPFEMALE:Is she the one with the apple in her mouth? Ma! You know, she looks pretty good for being in the ground for two hours.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, Rose, what are you doing? - Watching the cheese balls.
SUPMALE:You're supposed to be watching Dorothy! - I was watching Dorothy! But every time I watch her, Sophia eats a cheese ball.
LEADMALE:Honey, let her have the darn cheese balls.
LEADMALE:Nobody else wants them! - Cheese ball, Father? - Oh, yes, thank you very much.
SUPFEMALE:Now I know what I'm giving up for Lent! Stanley, would you be a dear and get me some champagne? It's always a pleasure to get a drink for an attractive woman.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get one for you too, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Would you excuse us? Have you ever met a man who knows how to push all your buttons? Just once.
SUPFEMALE:He was a cabana boy in Pensacola.
SUPFEMALE:I am never going to get through this.
LEADFEMALE:I just hate him too much.
SUPMALE:I know I'm gonna do something crazy! - You just simmer down, missy.
LEADMALE:Sit down here.
SUPFEMALE:I want to talk to you, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Listen, I know this isn't easy for you, so I'm gonna let you in on a sorority secret that was passed on to me at Miss MacGyver's Finishing School.
LEADFEMALE:Now, whenever you feel you're about to lose control, just take my hand and give it a little squeeze.
LEADFEMALE:I guarantee you'll feel 100% better.
LEADFEMALE:And that's the big secret? Oh, no! The big secret was that Miss MacGyver and Miss McKinney were sharing a one-bedroom apartment off campus.
LEADMALE:Oh, will you Here you go, ladies.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, would you like some hors d'oeuvres? - No, thank you, Stan.
SUPMALE:Blanche, would you care for something? Doesn't look like you're fighting the battle of the bulge.
SUPMALE:Oh, ow, ow.
SUPFEMALE:No, thank you, Stan.
SUPMALE:Well, then, I'd like to make a toast.
LEADFEMALE:Your attention please, everybody.
LEADMALE:To my son-in-law and my daughter - may she be as happy with her new life mate as I am with mine.
LEADFEMALE:Hear, hear! Blanche, don't you think it's time we cut the cake? Oh, yes, I do, Rose! Who invited the priest? You know I can't cut loose with a priest around.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, he happens to be a very nice man.
SUPMALE:He gives me the creeps.
SUPMALE:He's been following me.
OTHERFEMALE:They always follow the old people.
SUPMALE:It's like parking tickets.
LEADFEMALE:They got a last rites quota.
LEADMALE:Sophia, there you are.
SUPMALE:I've been looking all over for you.
LEADFEMALE:Buzz off, Padre.
LEADMALE:Rose, where's Dorothy? - I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:She was here a minute ago.
LEADMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God! - Give me that knife! - What are you doing? I can't let you go through with this! Do you want to spend the rest of your life rotting away in some disgusting jail cell, bribing screws for cigarettes and toilet paper? Rose, in Miami, it is not a felony to cut the wedding cake! Cut the wedd Oh, I thought you were gonna stab Stan.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be ridiculous! Do you honestly believe I would stab Stan at my own daughter's wedding? - Oh, no, I guess not.
LEADMALE:Well, of course not! I would wait until after the wedding.
LEADMALE:There are too many witnesses.
LEADMALE:No, no! - Kidding - Oh, don't do that to me! - What are you doing? - I just want to be by myself for awhile.
OTHERMALE:It's time to throw rice at the kids.
LEADMALE:I don't think I can go back out there.
SUPFEMALE:You're acting like a jerk.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Ma.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:That really makes me feel a lot better.
SUPMALE:Don't get smart with your mother! Listen, Dorothy, I love you dearly, but you're not the first woman to be dumped by her husband.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Ma, Ma, it's not what he did.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I've learned to live with that.
SUPFEMALE:It's the way he did it.
LEADFEMALE:The least he could have done was tell me to my face.
OTHERMALE:If you're so angry with him, tell him.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to kill him.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:But I want to.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, anger is a lot like a piece of shredded wheat caught under your dentures.
SUPMALE:If you leave it there, you get a blister and you gotta eat Jell-O all week.
SUPMALE:If you get rid of it, the sore heals, and you feel better.
LEADMALE:Anger is like a piece of shredded wheat? You want poetry, you listen to Neil Diamond.
LEADMALE:You want good advice? You listen to your mother.
SUPMALE:Maybe you're right.
SUPMALE:Of course I'm right.
LEADMALE:You think I got this old by being stupid? You know, you're the greatest mother in the world.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me something I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:(overlapping chatter Well, Mother, I guess this is it.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, sweetheart! Now listen, you be a good wife, you hear? Be his friend, be his lover.
SUPMALE:Don't be his slave.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, Mom, we'll talk when I get back.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you for everything.
SUPMALE:I love you.
SUPMALE:Oh, I love you too.
LEADMALE:And I love you too, Dennis! Goodbye, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:Listen, don't take any guff from her, you hear? But take good care of her.
LEADFEMALE:Because if you don't, I'll kill you, you know that.
LEADMALE:Oh, OK, everybody out! Goodbye, out! Goodbye! - Bye! - Be happy! Be happy! I really Dorothy, it was great.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for the hospitality.
SUPMALE:Sophia, girls, take care.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Stan, just a minute.
SUPMALE:I'd like to talk to you.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, sure, OK.
OTHERMALE:Let's go where we can have some privacy.
SUPFEMALE:Have a seat.
SUPFEMALE:What can I do for you? The first thing you can do is get rid of that ridiculous toupee.
LEADFEMALE:I want to speak to the bald guy who left me.
SUPMALE:Ow! What's the matter with you? - You walked out on me, Stanley Zbornak! - Now I know why.
LEADMALE:You walked out on me and you didn't have the decency to tell me you were leaving.
LEADMALE:I heard it from some lawyer over the telephone.
OTHERMALE:A stranger, Stanley, a total stranger, told me that my marriage was over.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, look, things happened.
SUPMALE:Things happened? You're damn right things happened.
OTHERMALE:and dreaming and fighting and loving and children and diapers and school plays and Little League.
LEADMALE:And worrying if you'd get through your gallbladder surgery.
LEADFEMALE:And wondering if I'd get through another Sunday dinner at your mother's house.
LEADFEMALE:And the lean years, when the business failed.
LEADMALE:And the good years, and the happy Christmases.
LEADMALE:All those things happened.
LEADMALE:And because they happened, I deserved better than a stinking phone call from my husband's legal representative.
SUPFEMALE:You had a choice and you took the easy way out.
LEADFEMALE:And it was a rotten thing to do! But now you're here in front of me and you can't run away.
SUPMALE:And I finally get to have what you tried to cheat me out of.
LEADMALE:I finally get to say goodbye, Stanley.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Dorothy, we - I said goodbye, Stanley.
SUPMALE:Honey, we just saw Stanley leaving.
OTHERMALE:Are you all right? - I'm fine.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't be fine! I don't know what I'd have done if Charlie had suddenly paid a visit! He's dead! You would have fainted! Are you Are you really all right? I'm feeling a little better.
LEADMALE:And tomorrow you're gonna feel a lot better.
LEADMALE:And the next day, maybe better still.
LEADFEMALE:And the next day, maybe - That's right, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:And then one day, Stanley's gonna be out of your life completely.
SUPFEMALE:Not completely.
LEADMALE:There will always be a little part of him that stays with me.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:After 38 years, there are always bound to be - some memories that stay with you.
OTHERMALE:I wasn't talking about memories.
LEADFEMALE:I was talking about this.
OTHERFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Discard already! I'm 80- I'd like to live long enough to see the next hand! No need to, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Gin.
SUPMALE:You're taking advantage.
LEADMALE:You know I'm whacked out on blood pressure medicine.
SUPMALE:Honey, if the medicine bothers you, change the prescription.
SUPFEMALE:I like being whacked out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm so glad you're here! My date's brother just came into town and unless I can find a date for him so we can double, the whole evening's gonna be called off.
LEADMALE:So what do you say? Would you please be a friend and go out with him? Sure, I'm game! Next time, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, what do you say? Oh, honey, I'd really love to go.
LEADMALE:But as you can see, I'm busy.
OTHERFEMALE:Busy? You're playing cards! We are not playing cards, we are playing gin rummy.
LEADMALE:And she stinks at it! We've been doing it for 30 years - she hasn't beaten me once! Tonight's going to be different.
SUPMALE:Tonight, the 30 years of humiliation ends! Ooh, I'm so scared, my dentures are chattering.
SUPFEMALE:Hi! - Oh, Rose, honey, are you up for a night on the town with two handsome, eligible bachelors? Thanks for asking, but I don't think so.
SUPMALE:I'm not that interested in dating anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Now you know that's not true, honey, or you'd let your hair go natural.
LEADMALE:You know what my problem really is? I'm spoiled.
SUPMALE:I had a long and wonderful marriage with a perfect man.
OTHERMALE:Everyone seems so ordinary after Charlie.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, it's just for dinner, and Charles would want you to eat.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Rose, be a friend.
SUPMALE:If you don't go, I can't go.
SUPMALE:I know I'm gonna regret this and I know I'm gonna have a miserable time, - but I'll go.
SUPMALE:Aw, that's the spirit! I'll go call the boys.
LEADMALE:Rose, why do you look so depressed? I'm tired of going out and not enjoying myself.
LEADMALE:All the men I meet act so old.
LEADMALE:Last week, I went out with this man that talked for two hours about his prostate problems.
SUPFEMALE:I lived in Minnesota for 51 years - I never even heard of a prostate.
OTHERMALE:Honey, they don't have them there.
LEADMALE:It's too cold.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, you should be going on this date.
SUPFEMALE:At least you'd have some fun.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing could be more fun than beating my mother at cards tonight.
LEADFEMALE:What's the name of the game? - Gin! Gin! Dorothy? What's the matter? Something wrong? The thrill of victory! The agony of defeat! I don't know why you play cards with your mother.
LEADMALE:It just makes you crazy.
LEADMALE:You're absolutely right, Blanche! This has gone on far too long! Mom, I am not playing gin with you anymore! You'll be back.
LEADMALE:You know why? You're too competitive! It's always been your worst feature.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, your ears are your worst feature.
LEADFEMALE:But competitive is right up there! Do you believe that? No.
OTHERFEMALE:I always thought your bony feet were your worst feature.
LEADMALE:Nighty-night! - Wait! Wait a minute! Wait a minute, you haven't told me about the double date! It was a complete disaster.
LEADFEMALE:You mean Rose and her guy didn't hit it off? Oh no, they got along just great.
LEADFEMALE:It was my escort who turned out to be the dud.
LEADMALE:Next time, I'm gonna date both brothers before I give one away.
LEADMALE:Hi! - Hi! I hear you had a great time tonight.
SUPMALE:It was the best! I haven't laughed so much or acted so silly since I was a teenager.
LEADFEMALE:You know what we did? - What? - We ran a tollbooth! - Oh Arnie said he just did it because it was there! Oh, he is the most outrageous, unpredictable man I have ever met! Jeffrey's on a low-sodium diet.
SUPFEMALE:I can't remember when I had so much fun! We went dancing at The Beachcomber.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna go back again tomorrow night.
SUPMALE:Jeffrey doesn't dance.
OTHERMALE:He says it makes his ankles swell.
OTHERMALE:Honey, I think it's terrific that you had a good time tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I have you two to thank for it.
OTHERFEMALE:Goodnight! - Goodnight.
LEADMALE:Goodnight! Blanche, come on now! Be happy for her! She finally met someone.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you go out with lots of interesting guys! Name one.
LEADMALE:How about that coach from the Miami Dolphins? Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:That night was kind of fun.
SUPFEMALE:The training room, the whirlpool, the adhesive tape Name another one.
LEADMALE:Honey, take a cold shower and go to bed.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, would you please open this jar of macadamia nuts for me? - You can't get it open? - Oh, I didn't try.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to risk cracking a nail.
LEADMALE:What are these, claws? I figured you wouldn't mind, seeing as how you work with your hands all day.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm a teacher - I grade papers.
LEADMALE:I don't shuck oysters! Thank you.
LEADMALE:I'm going next door to Frieda Goodson's.
LEADMALE:We're having a club meeting.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't know you were in a club.
LEADFEMALE:A bunch of us get together and send our pictures in to Willard Scott with a note saying we're 100.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, that's ridiculous! You got a better way to get on The Today Show? Will you take it inside, Rose? This isn't the French Quarter! - You'll think about next week, Rose? - I will, Arnie.
LEADFEMALE:Talk to you soon.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it looks like you and Arnie are getting pretty serious.
LEADMALE:Honey, are you all right? - I'll be fine.
SUPMALE:Is this about Arnie? No, Blanche, she's upset because they keep changing the taste of Coke.
OTHERFEMALE:Arnie wants me to go away with him on a cruise to the Bahamas.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, and you're upset because he wants you to pay your own way? I'm upset because we'll be all alone.
SUPFEMALE:In the middle of the ocean.
LEADFEMALE:On a ship.
SUPMALE:In a state room.
LEADMALE:With a bed.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what to do.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't been with a man in that special way since Charlie died.
LEADMALE:Get out of here! It's true! Charlie was the only lover I ever had.
LEADMALE:And my first time was on our wedding night.
OTHERFEMALE:Get out of here! Oh, back off, Blanche! Not all of us are classified by the Navy as a friendly port! Maybe it sounds strange, but without Charlie, I thought that part of my life was over.
LEADFEMALE:I never gave it a second thought.
OTHERFEMALE:Until now? Then I think you should go on the cruise.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, if the situation is right, you'll know it.
SUPMALE:But I'm not sure I'm ready.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, I know what you're going through.
SUPFEMALE:The bottom line is, if you take a chance in life, sometimes good things happen, sometimes bad things happen.
LEADFEMALE:But honey, if you don't take a chance, nothing happens.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna take a chance.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's wonderful! - Oh, great, Rose! Oh, I have to look in my closet.
SUPMALE:I don't even know what to wear the first night on the ship! A life jacket and a great big smile! - You startled me! - Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Next time I'II I'll knock.
SUPFEMALE:I like your bathrobe.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Kids gave it to me for Father's Day.
SUPMALE:I wish I had that knack.
OTHERFEMALE:Picking out unusual gifts.
OTHERFEMALE:Is it, um, is it terry cloth? - Yeah, I think it is.
LEADFEMALE:Terry cloth wears a long time.
LEADFEMALE:It's a nice fabric.
SUPMALE:Yes, perfect for a robe.
SUPFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess it's time to turn in.
SUPMALE:I guess.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you're not tired? - Not really.
OTHERFEMALE:Me neither.
LEADMALE:Do you feel like dancing? Oh, I'd love to.
LEADFEMALE:I can be dressed and back in that ballroom in ten minutes! No, no, Rose! We don't have to go through all that trouble.
OTHERMALE:See, I bought this for my grandson - sounded so good, I kept it for myself.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I love Glenn Miller! - Come on.
SUPFEMALE:I met my husband at a Glenn Miller dance.
LEADFEMALE:It wasn't really the Glenn Miller Orchestra - it was Dick Singleton and The Singletones.
OTHERMALE:Their motto 
OTHERMALE:if you close your eyes, you think it's Glenn Miller.
OTHERFEMALE:Believe me, no matter what you did, you knew it was Dick Singleton.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, Rose, you're one of a kind.
LEADMALE:That's what my husband used to say.
LEADFEMALE:You know, in a lot of ways, you remind me of Charlie.
LEADFEMALE:The way you laugh.
SUPMALE:The way you dance.
LEADFEMALE:Even the way Rose, I'm not Charlie.
LEADMALE:I'm Arnie Peterson from Plainfield, New Jersey.
LEADMALE:If you like me, it's for who I am, not for who I remind you of.
LEADFEMALE:I do like you, Arnie Peterson.
OTHERMALE:I like you too, Rose Nyland.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you can't sleep either, huh? - No.
LEADMALE:Want some tea? Oh, please.
SUPFEMALE:Watch what you're grabbing.
LEADFEMALE:I got a specimen in there.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, I wonder what Rose is doing right now.
SUPFEMALE:You mean, you wonder if she's doing it right now.
SUPFEMALE:No, I just wonder if maybe we didn't push her into something too fast.
LEADMALE:What I can't understand is how in the world she managed to wait 15 years.
SUPMALE:How long did you wait after George died? - 'Till the paramedics came.
LEADMALE:Ma! As the reverend was performing the funeral service, - I knew for sure that he wanted me.
LEADMALE:Oh I'd always known that there'd been something between us.
SUPFEMALE:Sometimes from the pulpit, he'd be talking about sin and he'd look straight at me.
LEADMALE:We couldn't do anything about it because he was married.
LEADMALE:But after his wife died, there was no stopping him.
LEADFEMALE:So? Well, we could finally consummate our long and burning passion.
OTHERMALE:And? It took about ten minutes.
OTHERMALE:He wore his watch and his socks.
LEADFEMALE:I never saw him again.
OTHERFEMALE:Your father didn't even take off his pants! Ma! What about you, Dorothy? Who was the first after Stan, hmm? - Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Her divorce lawyer.
SUPMALE:How did you know? - It's always the divorce lawyer.
LEADMALE:Oh, it was a terrible time for me.
SUPMALE:You know, I'd gone on an eating binge when Stan left and I put on quite a bit of weight.
LEADMALE:Plus, I was not a 20-year-old.
SUPFEMALE:You know, when you're 20, no matter what you do, everything stays where it's supposed to.
OTHERMALE:Now, when you lean over, it looks like somebody's let the air out of your face.
SUPFEMALE:What? Honey, lean over a mirror some time and take a look at yourself.
SUPFEMALE:Where's a mirror? - There's one in the tool drawer.
SUPMALE:I think you'd better take a sedative before you look.
LEADMALE:Don't be silly.
OTHERMALE:I look at my face all the time.
LEADMALE:How different could it be leaning over? Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Dorothy, why didn't you tell me about this before? Only on your back, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:That way everything slides back and you look like you just had a face lift.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gorgeous.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna have to meet men lying down.
SUPMALE:I thought you did.
LEADFEMALE:Of course that way, not only does your face fall back, but your chest does too.
LEADFEMALE:Unfortunately, it falls back and off to the side.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, Rose, are you still in there? This is crazy! Look, I talked to the purser.
OTHERFEMALE:Another cabin is available and I'll move to it.
SUPFEMALE:But I need to get in the bathroom, Rose.
SUPMALE:I hate to go anywhere without my Actifed.
LEADMALE:Good morning.
LEADFEMALE:I can't let you see my eyes.
LEADFEMALE:They look terrible from crying.
SUPMALE:Rose, you couldn't possibly look terrible to me.
SUPMALE:I left my contact lenses in the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I am so sorry.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, it can be awkward.
SUPFEMALE:I thought I could do it, I really did.
LEADFEMALE:And then I couldn't.
SUPFEMALE:You see, it would have been the first time since my husband died.
LEADFEMALE:I figured it was the first time.
OTHERMALE:It's been 15 years since he died, huh? Boy, he must have been something.
SUPFEMALE:This may sound silly, but it's true.
LEADMALE:I felt I would be unfaithful to Charlie if I slept with you.
SUPMALE:Rose, it's not silly.
SUPFEMALE:I felt that way when my wife died.
LEADMALE:You did? - Absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:'Course I didn't let that stop me.
LEADMALE:You mean you'd just make love and feel lousy? Well, I'd feel lousy about it.
LEADMALE:But otherwise, I'd feel terrific.
SUPFEMALE:Look, that's the difference between men and women, I guess.
SUPMALE:We can do it no matter what.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, I adored Molly, my wife.
OTHERMALE:We were married 34 years.
SUPMALE:Never slept with another woman.
LEADFEMALE:I looked, I enjoyed, I patted a few bottoms, but that was it, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:No, Molly was my world.
LEADMALE:Then one day a drunk in a Chevy took my world away.
SUPFEMALE:For a year, I was a zombie.
LEADFEMALE:I dressed, I worked, I slept.
LEADFEMALE:For fun, I ate onion sandwiches.
OTHERMALE:Then one day, my daughter sat me down and she said, "Mom would hate what you're doing.
SUPFEMALE:She would say, 'Arnie, who are you saving yourself for? I'm dead.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm not in heaven if I have to worry about you.
OTHERMALE:"' That convinced me.
LEADMALE:I wonder what Charlie would say, if he knew.
SUPMALE:Probably the same thing Molly said.
LEADFEMALE:Molly didn't actually say that, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:There's something else.
LEADFEMALE:Oh? I might kill you.
LEADMALE:What? What are you talking about? I've never told anybody this in my life, but my husband died while he was making love to me.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm afraid if we make love, I'll kill you.
LEADMALE:If you haven't made love in 15 years, that's a possibility.
SUPMALE:Hey, Rose Rose, don't worry about it.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I had a checkup a couple of weeks ago - I got the heart of a 12-year-old.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, whatever you want to do is fine with me.
SUPMALE:I just like being with you.
OTHERMALE:Hey, I'd better pack my stuff.
SUPFEMALE:Arnie? - Yeah? Sit down.
LEADMALE:Hold me.
LEADMALE:Buzz off.
LEADFEMALE:I'll spot you 25 points.
LEADMALE:Aw, Ma, enough already.
OTHERMALE:I'm not gonna play cards with you anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? - Why should I? You're the only one who gets any enjoyment out of it.
LEADMALE:Nah, cards bore me to tears.
SUPFEMALE:Then why do you play? - I like the talking.
OTHERFEMALE:The what? The talking.
OTHERFEMALE:You and I had some of our best talks over a game of gin rummy.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know why.
SUPFEMALE:It just seemed easier for both of us to open up while we were playing cards.
OTHERFEMALE:Your aunt Jean was the same way.
OTHERFEMALE:During a pinochle game, she told me that she swam nude in a pool with Charles Boyer.
LEADMALE:Aunt Jean? You never told me that.
SUPFEMALE:I would have gotten around to it, but we stopped playing cards.
OTHERMALE:Rose is back.
LEADFEMALE:Her taxi just pulled up.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I wonder if she had a great time on that cruise.
LEADMALE:She did if she fooled around.
SUPFEMALE:I can't wait to find out.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on now.
OTHERFEMALE:It's none of our business.
SUPFEMALE:I bet she did.
SUPMALE:I bet she got cold feet.
SUPFEMALE:Now listen, I want to know just as much as you two.
LEADFEMALE:But what happened between her and Arnie is private.
OTHERFEMALE:If she wants to talk about it, fine.
SUPMALE:But if she doesn't, I don't want anybody asking any embarrassing questions.
LEADFEMALE:I'm back! So, did you and Arnie play find the cannoli? - What? - Nothing, nothing Rose! Just sit down here, honey, and tell us all about your trip.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it was fabulous! The food was delicious.
SUPFEMALE:The weather was absolutely gorgeous.
SUPFEMALE:And the activities on board ship, well, the list goes on forever! Masquerade balls, hootenannies, tours of the engine room, fashion shows, Jazzercize, Las Vegas Night, Monte Carlo Night, Rio Night, Riviera Night Who cares, Rose! Did you and Arnie hit the sheets or not? Dorothy! - Some women don't kiss and tell.
OTHERMALE:Oh, shoot, honey, that's half the fun.
LEADMALE:Most of the boys I dated in college were just for the stories.
LEADFEMALE:You must have more stories than O.
LEADFEMALE:Henry! I'm gonna unpack.
LEADFEMALE:Now, this isn't fair.
LEADFEMALE:You have to tell us.
LEADFEMALE:No, you don't.
LEADMALE:But if you go out that door and don't come back in, we'll know you didn't.
LEADMALE:And if you do come back, that means you did.
OTHERFEMALE:It was wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! Oh, honey, this is terrific! Oh, I'm so happy, and I have you two to thank for it! You two? Don't you think Arnie should get at least an honorable mention? I want you to know, going on this cruise changed my life.
SUPFEMALE:Being with Arnie made me realize that I can care for a man again, without feeling guilty about it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's a nice feeling, you know, that when one part of your life is over, another part can begin.
LEADMALE:Now I'm really gonna unpack.
SUPMALE:Oh, let me help you, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get the juicy details.
LEADMALE:Ma, Persian Rummy? - 500 points? - Penny a point.
SUPFEMALE:You deal.
SUPFEMALE:I meant to tell you, I got a card from Gloria Pelizado today.
OTHERMALE:Oh, how many stamps did she use? Gloria Pelizado's been dead for two years.
SUPMALE:Who said Gloria Pelizado? I said Flo Pelizado.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you pay attention? - Oh, how is Flo? Oh, beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:She and her second husband, Pete, are in Rome.
SUPFEMALE:You remember Pete, the man you could have had? I did have him.
LEADMALE:That's why I didn't want him.
LEADFEMALE:You and Pete? You never told me that! Later, later.
OTHERMALE:First I want to hear about Aunt Jean and Charles Boyer.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you know your Aunt Jean.
LEADMALE:She was always just two steps away from the gutter.
LEADMALE:Anyway, one summer she decided to 
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Oh, it's a mess! This place is just a mess! Rose, what am I gonna do? She's gonna be here any minute.
LEADFEMALE:This place is a pigsty! - Oh, Blanche, it looks gorgeous.
LEADMALE:Don't sit! I just fluffed! - Honey, dust the table.
SUPMALE:I just did.
LEADFEMALE:Well, do it again.
SUPMALE:God, I wish she wasn't coming.
OTHERFEMALE:I just hate her.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you hate your sister.
SUPMALE:I despise her.
LEADMALE:Oh, I wish I'd gotten a decorator.
LEADFEMALE:Nancy Reagan's decorator.
LEADMALE:That'd kill my sister.
LEADFEMALE:She's your sister.
LEADMALE:How can you hate your sister? Because she made me and my big sister Charmaine miserable our entire lives.
LEADFEMALE:I never heard of such a thing.
OTHERFEMALE:You never heard of anybody hating their sister? Never.
SUPMALE:Maybe it's Southern.
OTHERFEMALE:Sleeping with your brothers is Southern.
LEADMALE:Dust, Rose, dust! We're running out of time.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia if you hated your sister, would you clean the house? I'd put Vaseline on the tips of her walker.
LEADMALE:Everybody, look what I have.
OTHERMALE:Where did you find? - Oh! Don't sit! Don't sit! - Oh, what is our name? - This is Danny.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, what in the world is that? - It's a flounder, Blanche.
SUPMALE:What do you think it is? - What's that baby doing here? It's Lucy and Ted's baby.
SUPFEMALE:Ted had a little accident waterskiing, and Lucy's taking him to the hospital.
SUPMALE:Now, we cannot have a baby in this house.
LEADMALE:My sister's coming.
LEADFEMALE:Does she eat them? I have cleaned this house from top to bottom.
LEADMALE:I have killed myself for two days.
LEADFEMALE:Babies make a mess.
SUPMALE:In diapers.
SUPFEMALE:And unless we use them as placemats, your sister will never know.
LEADMALE:Oh, Lord.
LEADMALE:Boochie-boochie-boo.
OTHERFEMALE:Oochie-oochie-boo-boo.
LEADMALE:Finally - someone she can talk to.
SUPMALE:I just hope it doesn't make a fuss when my sister's here.
LEADMALE:I thought you hate this sister.
SUPFEMALE:I do.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna put him to bed.
OTHERMALE:Ma, the ba-bas.
LEADMALE:Why do you hate your sister? That's what I wanna know.
SUPFEMALE:Because when she was born, I ceased to exist.
OTHERMALE:I never saw my mama and daddy again.
LEADFEMALE:Where did they go? They never looked at me again, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:She was the adorable one, the gorgeous one, the brilliant one.
SUPMALE:She sat in my daddy's lap for 16 years.
LEADMALE:Oh, and she was hateful.
LEADFEMALE:You know what she used to do? She used to bite herself on the arm and then run crying to Daddy that I had done it and he'd punish me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, she got me in trouble all the time.
OTHERMALE:Daddy used to call me the bad seed.
SUPFEMALE:Once, she even electrocuted me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no! Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:It was the day before Christmas and we were playing and she jiggled the tree and the star fell off and broke.
LEADMALE:So she told me to pick it up and put it on my finger.
SUPFEMALE:And I did.
LEADFEMALE:Then she plugged it in.
LEADMALE:And wham! My eyes bugged out, my hair shot straight up.
LEADMALE:I did a crazy rubber dance all over the room.
LEADMALE:I'm sure my heart stopped beating for a minute.
SUPMALE:Then she ran to Daddy and told him I'd broken the star and almost electrocuted her.
LEADMALE:And he sent me to my room for all of Christmas Eve and told me that the baby Jesus was mad at me for ruining his birthday.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, that's horrible.
SUPMALE:And that's not the worst part.
SUPMALE:That darn electricity straightened my hair.
LEADFEMALE:I used to have curly hair.
LEADMALE:That was a lovely lunch, Blanche.
LEADMALE:A lovely lunch in a lovely house with your lovely friends.
OTHERMALE:Stop making fun of me, Virginia.
LEADFEMALE:Making fun of you? Honey, I was complimenting you.
LEADFEMALE:I heard the way you said "lovely.
SUPMALE:" - How did I say "lovely"? Oh, you know very well how you said "lovely.
LEADFEMALE:" You said "lovely" the same way you say "lovely" to a date who's just shown up in a light-blue tuxedo.
SUPMALE:Well, I meant "lovely" no matter how it came out.
SUPMALE:I guess maybe I just didn't think you'd recognize good taste.
LEADMALE:You know, this house was done by Nancy Reagan's decorator.
LEADFEMALE:Really? - Yes.
LEADFEMALE:But never mind about that.
LEADFEMALE:Let's talk about you.
OTHERFEMALE:You look like you lost weight, sugar.
LEADMALE:I have.
LEADMALE:Hm.
LEADFEMALE:You know, at your age, when you lose weight, your skin just hangs there.
LEADMALE:Like leaves on a willow.
SUPMALE:I haven't lost that much.
LEADMALE:I don't think that's happened yet.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:But if I were you, I sure wouldn't wave goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:And if I were you, I sure wouldn't jog without a muumuu.
LEADMALE:Is that so? Well, just let me tell you something! Oh, Blanche, please.
OTHERMALE:Let's not do this.
SUPMALE:Let's grow up.
SUPFEMALE:For God's sake, we have done this our whole lives long! Let's call an end to it, OK? Sure, whatever.
LEADFEMALE:So you thinking about getting a face-lift? For your - how do I put this delicately? - turkey wattle or what? There, there.
OTHERFEMALE:It's colic.
LEADMALE:My children had it.
SUPMALE:You give them brandy.
SUPFEMALE:For colic? Yes.
LEADMALE:After dinner with a cigar.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, you give brandy for teething.
LEADMALE:You rub it on their gums.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I thought I gave it to them for colic.
LEADFEMALE:In their bottles.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, my babies were very happy.
SUPMALE:Put it in my bottle.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be happy too.
LEADMALE:Look at this - pop-ups.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that wonderful? Mm.
SUPFEMALE:Remember when we had to use cotton and fish ointment? That's nothing.
LEADFEMALE:In Sicily, we use a leaf and the river.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, you never had a baby in Sicily.
LEADFEMALE:I was a baby in Sicily.
LEADFEMALE:Disposable bottles and formula.
LEADFEMALE:We had to sterilize our bottles and make our formula.
LEADMALE:I nursed.
LEADFEMALE:Your brother was 12 when he stopped.
LEADFEMALE:He wanted to come home from school at lunchtime.
OTHERMALE:I got nothing left up here.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma.
SUPMALE:Well, she's gone.
OTHERMALE:That's it? That's why we couldn't sit on the couch for two days? No.
OTHERFEMALE:I have to have dinner with her tonight.
LEADMALE:Why is that baby still here? They're still at the hospital.
SUPMALE:It's taking a little longer than they thought.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, your sister seemed very nice.
LEADMALE:She was nicer than she's ever been.
LEADFEMALE:She was interested, charming, caring, loving.
LEADMALE:Just couldn't have been more wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:I just wonder what she wants, the conniving little witch.
LEADFEMALE:You're welcome, Maurice.
LEADFEMALE:Let's make a toast.
SUPMALE:With water? - Well, I can't drink.
SUPFEMALE:You never could.
LEADFEMALE:One Jack Daniel's and you'd disappear with half a fraternity house.
LEADFEMALE:We said we weren't gonna do this.
LEADMALE:Well, what else can we do? We never held a real conversation our entire lives.
LEADMALE:Then it's time for us to start, OK? - Fine with me.
LEADFEMALE:To us.
LEADMALE:To the beginning of a new and wonderful relationship.
LEADFEMALE:To sisters.
LEADFEMALE:That's very sweet, Virginia.
LEADFEMALE:Now, what do you want? What is it with you? You just step on any kind of tender moment.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, tender moment, my foot.
LEADMALE:All my life you've taken everything that ever meant anything to me.
OTHERMALE:What did I take? A couple of cashmere sweaters and a poodle skirt? You took my poodle skirt? Was that you? Blanche, that was over 40 years ago.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, shut up.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe that you are still crazy about that.
LEADMALE:It's not over that.
OTHERFEMALE:It's over Tom.
LEADFEMALE:Tom? Don't act so surprised, Virginia.
LEADMALE:You knew I was dating him.
LEADMALE:Then I had to go to the country to visit Aunt Augusta and when I got back, I had poison ivy and you had Tom.
LEADMALE:I loved that boy.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted to marry him.
LEADFEMALE:We were serious.
SUPFEMALE:You only had two dates with him.
LEADFEMALE:I was fast.
SUPFEMALE:I swear I didn't think that you liked him at all.
LEADMALE:Then I had to be maid of honor at your wedding.
OTHERFEMALE:I had to stand there and watch you marry Tom.
SUPMALE:And I had to wear that green dress, which you knew was my most awful color.
LEADFEMALE:I looked just like a swamp frog.
LEADMALE:Everyone I ever loved, you took.
LEADFEMALE:Would it help you to know that Tom fooled around? No.
LEADMALE:With who? - Everyone.
LEADMALE:Huh.
SUPMALE:Serves you right.
SUPMALE:Blanche! - Well, it does.
SUPMALE:What goes around, comes around.
LEADMALE:Well, then, I must have been really bad.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean? - Well, it's the reason I'm here.
SUPFEMALE:I knew it.
LEADFEMALE:I knew you had a reason.
SUPMALE:Better be a good one.
LEADMALE:I'm dying.
LEADFEMALE:What? I'm dying.
LEADMALE:Well my God.
LEADMALE:That explains it, then.
LEADFEMALE:What? Why you're looking so much older than I am.
SUPMALE:Ma, could you eat a little more quietly, please? These are Fritos.
LEADFEMALE:You want me to swallow them whole? - Hi, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, the baby gone? No, Rose is driving him around to get him to sleep.
LEADMALE:Why is he still here? - Ted needs some minor surgery, so they're still at the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:What about Virginia? - Well - Shh-shh-shh-shh.
LEADFEMALE:Is he asleep? - You need any help? - No.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna have that baby till college.
LEADFEMALE:Shh.
LEADFEMALE:So how was dinner? - I'm still in shock.
SUPFEMALE:What happened? - I just can't believe it.
SUPMALE:What? - You never think you're gonna hear that.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, tell me.
LEADFEMALE:She's dying.
LEADFEMALE:What? - My sister's dying.
LEADFEMALE:What? - Dying, she's dying.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God, Blanche! Oh, honey, I didn't even know you were sick! - Not Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Her sister! - Oh, thank God! Oh! And she came here to tell you.
LEADMALE:Is that it? No, please.
OTHERMALE:She could've done that over the phone.
LEADMALE:It was like I said.
LEADMALE:She wanted something.
LEADMALE:Enough already! I mean, the woman is dying.
SUPMALE:What could she possibly want from you? My kidney.
LEADFEMALE:Your kidney? My kidney.
LEADMALE:Why would she need a kidney? - To feed the cat, Rose! She's going into renal failure, so a transplant is her best hope.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:What happens if she doesn't get your kidney? She'll die.
SUPMALE:You hold her life in your hands? - What are you gonna do? - I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad you're not my sister.
SUPMALE:I need something to eat.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't you just have dinner? Oh, I couldn't eat.
LEADFEMALE:I was just too stunned.
LEADFEMALE:What are you gonna do, Blanche? - I don't know.
OTHERMALE:I mean, it's not as if she were my daughter.
LEADFEMALE:She's my sister.
SUPFEMALE:My sister that I hate.
LEADFEMALE:I wish I could give her my kidneys, let her get up all night.
SUPFEMALE:And what if I give her my kidney and then the one good kidney I have left stops working? - What'll I do then, ask for my kidney back? - You'd be an Indian giver.
LEADFEMALE:I need both my kidneys.
LEADMALE:You know what'll happen if I give her one? My ankles will swell, my eyes will puff up.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll look just like the Pillsbury Doughboy.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, that does not happen.
OTHERMALE:You can live just fine with one kidney.
LEADFEMALE:I can't eat this food.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm going to bed.
LEADMALE:I'll just think about it tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:All I know is, girls, I'm in a no-win situation here.
LEADMALE:I lose a sister or a kidney.
LEADMALE:Either way, no matter what I do, I'm gonna lose something.
SUPFEMALE:What would you do? For my children, I wouldn't even have to think.
LEADMALE:I mean, I'd give them both of my kidneys.
LEADMALE:I'd cut 'em out myself.
LEADMALE:Me too.
LEADMALE:I'd give them my heart.
SUPMALE:I'd give to all my children, except Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Why not Phil? - Because he never calls, he never writes.
LEADMALE:I only hear from him at Christmas when he sends me a cheddar cheese nativity scene.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Catholic.
SUPMALE:I can't spread a wise man on a Ritz cracker.
SUPFEMALE:If I still had my dog Fluffy, I'd give to him.
LEADMALE:You'd give what to Fluffy? - My kidney.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Rose.
SUPMALE:You'd give a kidney to a dog? - Absolutely.
LEADMALE:So he could whiz on your rug? I would give to him because of everything he gave to me.
LEADFEMALE:He was loving, he was loyal, he was fun.
SUPMALE:He never left my side.
LEADFEMALE:I wish my ex had been like Fluffy.
LEADMALE:Would've solved a lot of problems.
SUPMALE:You could've had him fixed.
OTHERMALE:Oh, poor Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, I know you need some time to think it over.
SUPFEMALE:You're damn right I do.
OTHERMALE:We're talking about a vital organ in my body here.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:You gonna give it to her or not? - Sophia.
LEADMALE:What does it mean - a little less bourbon? It's a big decision, Sophia.
LEADMALE:She's got to think about it.
LEADMALE:She's family.
OTHERFEMALE:If you can't count on family, who the hell can you count on? She's Italian.
SUPFEMALE:I'll understand, you know, if you decide not to.
LEADFEMALE:How come you didn't ask Charmaine for her kidney? You were always closer to Charmaine.
SUPFEMALE:Charmaine's kidneys are attached to each other.
OTHERMALE:What do you mean, attached? - The two are joined.
LEADMALE:It's like having one big kidney, and you can't separate 'em.
LEADMALE:Leave it to Charmaine.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:She never could help Mama because she had heart flutters, and she never could take gym class, no, because she had a tipped uterus, and she never did any housework because she had a spastic colon.
SUPFEMALE:Now, she has attached kidneys.
LEADMALE:That girl is some kind of mutant.
LEADMALE:I'd give you one of my kidneys, but I'm sure you'd rather have one you can control.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:Welcome.
LEADMALE:Look, if you decide not to, I'll understand.
OTHERMALE:I swear.
OTHERMALE:Sure, you'll be dead.
LEADMALE:And everybody will say Blanche killed her.
OTHERFEMALE:What I'm trying to say is it's a terrible choice I've given you.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even know what I would do under the same circumstances.
SUPFEMALE:Are you saying you don't know if you'd give me a kidney? No, I don't.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'm not surprised.
SUPFEMALE:You never even lent me a Kleenex.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, I'm a size eight - your kidney wouldn't fit me.
LEADMALE:There's not room in my body for your kidney.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess I'd better be going, and if you decide to go ahead with it, I'll see you in Atlanta in a few days.
SUPFEMALE:Are you scared? - Terrified.
LEADFEMALE:I guess anybody would be.
SUPMALE:I guess.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, whatever happens I love you.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:The doctor says it's the first time he'd ever been called because a baby was sleeping in the day.
LEADFEMALE:And then I think he called me an idiot.
SUPFEMALE:He sleeps in the day because he has four women who won't let him sleep at night.
LEADFEMALE:Now, who went in there last night? Was it you? - Well, I went in once.
LEADFEMALE:Why? - I was working.
LEADFEMALE:I hadn't seen him all day.
SUPFEMALE:And was he sleeping? At first.
OTHERMALE:This has got to stop.
SUPMALE:No wonder that baby didn't sleep.
LEADMALE:He wasn't the only one who was up all night.
LEADFEMALE:You were too? - Yes.
SUPFEMALE:I had time to do a lot of thinking.
LEADFEMALE:And? - And of course I'm gonna do it.
OTHERMALE:Aw, Blanche, you're a brave lady.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you really are, honey.
LEADFEMALE:No, I have to.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want my sister to die.
LEADFEMALE:I want her to live.
LEADFEMALE:And not just for her, for me.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna get to know her like a grownup.
LEADMALE:Well, I want us to have a chance to be friends, sisters.
OTHERMALE:After all, she's the only family I have.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you had a sister, Charmaine.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you can't count her! Why, she's an awful, selfish, neurotic woman who made me and Virginia miserable our entire lives.
LEADFEMALE:I gotta go pack.
SUPFEMALE:I hate to give him back.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, Danny.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye, pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye, little fella.
SUPMALE:What are you carrying on? It's like talking to a salami.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he has to leave.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADMALE:Say bye-zee-bye! - Bye, darling.
LEADFEMALE:You be good now.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm worried about Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I wish she'd let one of us go with her.
LEADFEMALE:Not me.
SUPFEMALE:I hate hospitals.
LEADMALE:My friend Matty Fishbein went into the hospital a healthy guy.
LEADFEMALE:Then boom, boom - dead, just like that, in his sleep.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't like hospitals either.
OTHERMALE:They're full of germs.
LEADMALE:I always hold my breath in the elevators 'cause there are sick people in the elevators and it's such a small space.
LEADMALE:Once, I had to go to the eighth floor in a hospital, and the elevator stopped on every floor, and I had to hold my breath all that time.
OTHERFEMALE:And I finally fainted and I hit my head and I had to stay there because I had a concussion, and I had to hold my breath all the way down in the elevator to the emergency room.
LEADFEMALE:Then I had to hold my breath in the x-ray, where they ask you to hold your breath anyway.
LEADMALE:And then after I have great news.
LEADMALE:Rose, excuse me.
LEADMALE:We'll get back to your fascinating hospital story later.
SUPFEMALE:Ted and Lucy said that we could have the baby again next month - when they go away for a weekend.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's wonderful.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I'm so excited.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, what are you doing here? Is something wrong? I mean, we didn't expect you back so soon.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, the best possible thing has happened.
OTHERMALE:I still have both my kidneys and my sister's fine.
SUPMALE:Blanche, how is that possible? They couldn't use my kidney - my blood vessels were too small.
LEADMALE:Of course they're too small.
LEADFEMALE:I've always been very petite.
LEADMALE:Blanche, Virginia.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, the most wonderful thing happened.
LEADMALE:They found a donor, an excellent match.
LEADFEMALE:She was a retired Mormon schoolteacher.
LEADFEMALE:Virginia's so lucky! Oh, I'll say.
SUPFEMALE:That kidney was showroom-new.
SUPMALE:Why, the wildest thing that ever passed through there was Ovaltine.
LEADFEMALE:But the best part of it was that hunk of a doctor who examined me - he's gonna be in Florida in a few weeks.
LEADFEMALE:Wherever she goes, she finds a man! So do hookers.
LEADMALE:But the most wonderful thing about all this is Virginia and me.
OTHERFEMALE:All that time we wasted hating each other from when we were kids.
LEADMALE:Now we're getting to know each other, and I just love her.
OTHERMALE:I finally have a sister to love.
LEADMALE:Isn't it funny? Sometimes you have to almost lose somebody before you realize how much they really mean to you.
OTHERMALE:Let's go out and celebrate life.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go out and do something crazy! Let's fly to Freeport and gamble all night.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, we can't afford it.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's drive to Disney World and ride the Teacups! Oh, too wild, Rose.
SUPMALE:Hey, I know a bar over in Coco Beach where you can pick up over-the-hill astronauts.
SUPMALE:Ow! Or there's some Rocky Road in the freezer.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, great! 
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute! Just where do you think you're going? Over to Mildred's to watch the adult movie channel.
LEADMALE:She has a wide-screen TV.
LEADFEMALE:You are not going anywhere.
SUPMALE:Dr.
LEADMALE:Clayton is coming.
SUPMALE:Dr.
OTHERFEMALE:Silvano is my doctor! - Dr.
LEADMALE:Silvano is dead.
SUPMALE:Trust me, I'm in better shape than he is.
SUPMALE:Goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you have to have an examination.
LEADMALE:Your blood pressure is up, you're tired, you have absolutely no color.
SUPFEMALE:I'm an old white woman.
SUPMALE:I'm not supposed to have color.
OTHERFEMALE:You want color? Talk to Lena Horne.
LEADMALE:Here we are, Sophia.
OTHERMALE:Homemade chicken soup.
SUPMALE:I used to make it for my husband when he wasn't feeling well.
OTHERMALE:Did you make it for him the last time he wasn't feeling well? - Hello, everyone.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I just happened upon the most divine dress sale.
LEADMALE:I would'have called you girls, but all they had left were petites.
SUPMALE:So what did you buy? Shoes? I'm a petite.
LEADMALE:I'd better go there.
LEADMALE:I need a black dress for Dr.
OTHERFEMALE:Silvano's funeral.
LEADFEMALE:Dr.
LEADMALE:Silvano died two months ago.
LEADMALE:You went to his funeral.
LEADFEMALE:Right, I can't let him see me in the same dress.
LEADMALE:Ma, you're not going anywhere until the doctor comes! You can't go anywhere now.
LEADMALE:I want you to see how good I look in my new dress! You know something? We're really lucky we found a doctor who makes house calls.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:When I was growing up in Minnesota, the doctor made house calls all the time for us and the livestock.
SUPMALE:You and the animals had the same doctor? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Worked out fine until the doctor started drinking hog liniment and tried to neuter the Swensen brothers.
OTHERFEMALE:(doorbell If that's the doctor, tell him I have no insurance and no money! If he still wants to come in, he just wants to see me naked.
SUPMALE:Hello, I'm Dr.
SUPMALE:Clayton.
LEADMALE:I'm here to see Sophia Petrillo.
SUPFEMALE:Oh please, please come right in.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Dorothy, Sophia's daughter, and I usually look much better.
LEADMALE:Now, this is my friend, Rose.
SUPMALE:Hello, doctor.
LEADMALE:Rose.
LEADFEMALE:And this is Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:What seems to be her problem? - Her blood pressure is up and she's a little pale and a little tired.
LEADMALE:She on any medication? - Yes, to control blood pressure.
LEADFEMALE:How long's she been on that medication? - What am I, two years old? I don't know my own symptoms? I've lived in this body since I was born.
SUPMALE:If something goes wrong, I'm the first one to hear about it! I'm sorry, Sophia.
LEADMALE:What seems to be the problem? What am I, a doctor? Why don't we start by taking your temperature, huh? Temperature, hmm.
LEADFEMALE:He must have graduated at the top of his class.
LEADMALE:Under your tongue.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, tell me, - are you new to this area, Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Clayton? - Yes.
LEADFEMALE:I recently moved here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Miami's a beautiful city.
SUPMALE:I'm sure you'll enjoy living here.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, and I'm sure your wife, Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Clayton, will enjoy it, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Clayton and I are no longer together.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm so sorry.
LEADFEMALE:So, tell me, have you had a chance - to see much of the city? - No, not really.
LEADMALE:Perhaps I could show you some of the highlights sometime.
LEADFEMALE:That sounds great.
OTHERMALE:I'd love it! I'd love to go, too.
LEADFEMALE:Except I have to wash my hair every day for the rest of my life.
SUPFEMALE:It's very oily.
OTHERFEMALE:What about dinner tomorrow night, Dorothy? Say, about eight? Perfect! We'll go to Jack's Crab House.
LEADMALE:It's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Well, girls, is this dress gonna stop traffic or what? Oh, hello there.
SUPMALE:I don't believe we've been introduced.
LEADFEMALE:My name is Blanche Deveraux.
LEADFEMALE:That's French for "Blanche Deveraux.
LEADMALE:" - I'm pleased to meet you.
OTHERMALE:Forgive me for staring, but I do declare, you're just about the most attractive man I've seen in Florida since Mr.
LEADMALE:John Forsythe performed Hamlet at the Burt Reynolds Dinner Theatre.
LEADMALE:Blanche, might I see you a moment? Pardonnez-moi.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, you keep your bloomers on, Scarlett.
OTHERFEMALE:He's taking me out tomorrow night.
SUPFEMALE:But he wants me.
LEADFEMALE:I can feel it.
LEADMALE:Let somebody else feel it.
OTHERFEMALE:I saw him first.
SUPMALE:But we were meant for each other.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a woman, he's a man.
LEADMALE:And what am I, Little Richard? Oh, all right.
OTHERFEMALE:Fair's fair.
LEADFEMALE:But if he has a friend who makes house calls, I can be ill any night this week except Thursday.
SUPMALE:Well, doctor, how is she? - Her temperature seems to be normal.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me, Sophia, are you taking your medication as directed? I take my medication every day, if I remember.
LEADMALE:You have to remember to take it every day.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'll see that she does, Dr.
SUPMALE:Clayton.
LEADMALE:Elliot.
LEADMALE:Well, ladies, it's been a great pleasure meeting you.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, it's been especially nice meeting you.
LEADMALE:I'm sure she's all right, but you call me if you need me, and I'll see you tomorrow night.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, Elliot.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank you for being a kind and generous god.
SUPMALE:OK, what do you think of this one? Dorothy, you and Elliot have been out almost every night this week.
LEADMALE:He's obviously hooked.
SUPMALE:You don't have to look good anymore.
LEADMALE:What you have on is fine.
SUPFEMALE:I'll change.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:I'll help you pick out something.
LEADMALE:There's nothing left to pick.
LEADFEMALE:The only thing I haven't tried on is the bedspread.
SUPMALE:(doorbell - Oh, hello, Elliot.
LEADFEMALE:Come in.
SUPMALE:Hello, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Dorothy ready? I'm afraid she's gonna be a little while.
LEADMALE:May I offer you a drink? Why, sure, if you'll join me.
LEADMALE:I don't mind if I do.
LEADMALE:What would you like? Something smooth and sweet with a little kick to it.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:How about a Sloe Gin Fizz? You're talking about the drink and I'm talking about the bartender.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Blanche, you feel all right? - You feel a little flushed.
LEADMALE:I do? Yeah, let me check your pulse.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, it's racing.
LEADFEMALE:You know what? So is mine.
LEADFEMALE:I beg your pardon? - You're a very attractive woman, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Very very attractive.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? How dare you? - What kind of woman do you think I am? - Relax.
LEADFEMALE:Relax? Don't you tell me to relax! I am not accustomed to being manhandled.
SUPMALE:I thought you'd be flattered.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm not.
SUPFEMALE:Pardon my strong language, but you, sir, are no gentleman.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:You ought to be.
SUPFEMALE:What about Dorothy? - She happens to be my friend.
LEADMALE:No reason to bring Dorothy into this.
LEADMALE:Hmm.
LEADMALE:Hi, Elliot.
LEADMALE:Hello, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:My, what is that marvelous scent you're wearing? Fancy albacore tuna.
OTHERMALE:I made a casserole for dinner.
SUPMALE:Well, you certainly wear it well.
OTHERFEMALE:I think it's the pimento that really sets it off.
OTHERMALE:Hello, Elliot.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry I'm late.
LEADFEMALE:It's all right, but we should be going.
LEADFEMALE:If I'm not back by Christmas, someone take my mother to midnight mass.
LEADFEMALE:There is something about that man I don't trust.
SUPMALE:I can't put my finger on it.
LEADMALE:I can.
LEADFEMALE:He's a letch.
SUPFEMALE:No, that isn't it.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes it is, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:He made a pass at me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my Lord! That's terrible! Dorothy'll be heartbroken when you tell her.
SUPMALE:I'm not telling her anything.
OTHERFEMALE:She's your friend.
SUPFEMALE:You've got to tell her! - Oh, no, I don't.
LEADMALE:The last time a friend's sweetheart made a pass at me, I lost my friend and her beau.
SUPFEMALE:And her beau? - That's right.
OTHERMALE:Anderbeau Johnson.
SUPMALE:Clyde Whitehead, Anderbeau's beau, decided he wanted to see my cheerleader's sweater from the inside.
OTHERFEMALE:So when I told Anderbeau, she blamed the whole thing on me, and then Clyde would never speak to me again for telling! I lost Anderbeau and her beau! Now you understand why I can't tell Dorothy? I don't even understand who Anderbobo is.
LEADMALE:All I know is that Dorothy should find out what kind of a man Elliot really is.
LEADMALE:Now, if you're her friend, you'll tell her.
LEADFEMALE:But honey, she'd be devastated! What kind of a friend would I be to hurt her? What kind of a friend would you be if you let Elliot ruin her life? She could marry that man! They could have a child! They could adopt a child! And then one night at the country club, possibly during little Mei-Ling's coming-out party Dorothy's having the time of her life when she goes to the powder room and she overhears the towel lady telling Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Steinbeck that Dorothy's husband, Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Elliot Clayton, has bonged every female member of the country club.
LEADMALE:Can you let that happen to Dorothy? Can you let that happen to little Mei-Ling? Hasn't she suffered enough? Not as much as I have listening to that story.
SUPMALE:Oh forget the story.
LEADMALE:You have to tell Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:She's your friend! You're right.
LEADFEMALE:She is my best friend.
SUPMALE:I thought I was your best friend.
OTHERMALE:You were till you told me that story.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Good night, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Good night, Elliot.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you'd never come home.
SUPMALE:I have to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:Is something wrong? Is it Ma? - Oh, no, she's fine.
LEADMALE:It's just that you're out so late on a school night.
LEADFEMALE:What? - I mean, how was your date with Elliot? Wonderful, as usual.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, I have to tell you something.
SUPFEMALE:It's just so hard.
OTHERMALE:I don't know how to tell you, except, I guess, just straight out.
LEADFEMALE:What? Well Elliot made Elliot made What? Elliot made a What? What did Elliot make, a ship in a bottle? What? Elliot made a pass at me.
LEADFEMALE:Elliot made a pass at you? You mean, he winked at you.
LEADFEMALE:He winks at everyone.
LEADFEMALE:He's a very big winker.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:It was more than a wink.
LEADFEMALE:He came up to me, and he put his big, masculine arms around my tiny little waist.
LEADMALE:I don't believe you.
LEADFEMALE:What? I don't believe that he put his big, masculine arms around your alleged tiny little waist.
LEADFEMALE:Why would I make up such a thing? - Because you're jealous.
LEADMALE:Jealous? You're used to getting all the attention, and someone comes along and wants me and not you and it is eating your guts out.
LEADMALE:Eating my guts out? - You know something? You could never be a real friend to another woman, and you know why? - Why? - Because you're a slut! - A slut?! - Don't repeat everything I say.
SUPMALE:Don't repeat everything you say? I'm not! - You just did.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing you say's worth repeatin'.
LEADFEMALE:You, Blanche, are an amoral, backstabbing, self-centered Jezebel, and I am very glad that this happened because now I know really what kind of person you are.
LEADMALE:The hell with you and your oversexed boyfriend, Dorothy Zbornak! I'm just glad that little Mei-Ling's coming-out party was ruined.
LEADMALE:Who? And I'm glad that Elliot is bonging every woman at your country club! What the hell are you talking about? Ask the towel lady! Morning, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Can I get you some coffee? "Dorothy deserves to know what kind of a person Elliot really is.
LEADMALE:If you're her friend, you'll tell her.
LEADFEMALE:" Thanks for the advice, Rose.
SUPMALE:Now Dorothy's not speaking to me, and I'm not speaking to you.
LEADMALE:Now you can get me that coffee.
OTHERMALE:I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but you did the right thing by telling Dorothy about Elliot.
LEADMALE:What about Elliot? - He made a pass at me.
LEADMALE:While he's seeing my Dorothy? - Yes.
LEADMALE:I can't believe it! My daughter is finally dating a doctor he turns out to be a scuzz bucket! Why does everything happen to me? - Dorothy hates me.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, that's not true! Oh, yes it is, and I hate her right back double.
OTHERMALE:Now get me some cream.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche and I were just having some coffee.
LEADFEMALE:Would you care to join us? - Frankly, Rose, I would rather use Willie Nelson's hairbrush.
LEADMALE:Must you attack everything Southern? Come on, now, girls.
LEADFEMALE:This is no way to behave.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't there some way we can settle this like rational adults? We can, once Dorothy stops acting like a child.
SUPFEMALE:I am acting like a child? Do you know what your problem is? - (doorbell - That's Elliot.
LEADMALE:I have to leave.
SUPFEMALE:How dare you leave in the middle of a fight? You come back here! I have a few things I want to say to you, missy! All right, girls, now hold it right there, and I'm not fooling around! Dorothy, I think you have to confront Elliot with Blanche's accusation.
SUPMALE:Absolutely not! Now, I have to go.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Ready to go? Not quite.
LEADFEMALE:Elliot, Blanche says that you made a pass at her.
LEADFEMALE:What? - You heard her.
LEADMALE:I don't know what to say.
LEADFEMALE:You sure knew what to say last night Elliot, did you make a pass at Blanche or not? - Absolutely not.
LEADFEMALE:He's lying.
SUPMALE:Look at him, he's twitching and blinking.
SUPFEMALE:He's lying and twitching and blinking.
OTHERFEMALE:He is blinking, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Maybe I had better wait for you in the car.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, you just have to believe me.
LEADFEMALE:It's not enough that you have had half the men in Dade County.
OTHERFEMALE:You have to have everyone else's men.
LEADFEMALE:It is pathetic.
SUPMALE:I have just never felt so betrayed in all my life.
LEADMALE:I haven't been a good friend to a lot of people, but I have been a very good friend to you, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:And you take some stranger's word over mine? I'm not gonna stand for this, not in my own house.
LEADMALE:I want you out of here.
SUPMALE:Blanche, you don't mean that.
OTHERFEMALE:She doesn't mean it.
LEADMALE:I do so mean it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be out as soon as I can find a place.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, you can't just throw Dorothy out on the street! You just watch me.
SUPFEMALE:What's the matter, Sophia? You couldn't sleep, either? No, I was sleeping great, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:I just wanted to show off my pajamas.
SUPFEMALE:I'm upset about Dorothy and Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, me, too.
SUPFEMALE:Who'd believe that they'd break up their friendship over a man? - It happens.
LEADFEMALE:What can we do? - Nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:Just stay out of it.
LEADMALE:I can't do that.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me tell you a story.
LEADFEMALE:Sicily, 1912.
LEADFEMALE:Picture 
LEADFEMALE:Two young girls, best friends, who shared three things a pizza recipe, some dough, and a dream.
LEADFEMALE:Everything is going great until one day, a fast-talking pepperoni salesman gallops into town.
SUPMALE:Of course, both girls are impressed.
SUPMALE:He dates one one night, the other, the next night.
LEADFEMALE:Pretty soon, he drives a wedge between them.
LEADMALE:Before you know it, the pizza suffers, the business suffers, the friendship suffers.
OTHERMALE:The girls part company and head for America, never to see one another again.
SUPMALE:Rose, one of those girls was me.
SUPFEMALE:The other one you probably know as Mama Celeste.
LEADMALE:Sophia, what's the point? The point is, I lost a fortune! What does that have to do with getting Dorothy and Blanche back together? Nothing! I told you, stay out of it! I can't! I can't just stand by and watch this happen.
LEADMALE:I've got to do something.
LEADMALE:That might work, too.
LEADMALE:Abbondanzal Rose, honey, can I borrow your golf gloves? I already packed mine.
LEADFEMALE:Only if you promise not to move out.
SUPFEMALE:I cannot promise that! Then putt with bare hands! (doorbell - Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Ready to go? - Soon as Rose lends me some gloves.
OTHERMALE:They're in the bottom drawer on the left, under my clarinet.
LEADMALE:Be right back.
LEADMALE:Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Jerry Vale? - No.
LEADFEMALE:They should.
OTHERMALE:He's the only man in the world that can make the hair on my arms stand up.
OTHERFEMALE:Can I fix you a drink? No, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Is something wrong with your leg? Nothing you can't fix, doctor man.
LEADMALE:I beg your pardon? - I know I look square, but I'm like my father's tractor.
LEADMALE:I take awhile to warm up, but once I get going, I can turn your topsoil 'til the cows come home.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, please.
SUPFEMALE:Wanna see some Polaroids of me in my tennis skirt? Look, Rose, I'm flattered, and please, no offense, but you're just not my type.
LEADFEMALE:But Blanche was.
LEADMALE:That never happened.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yes it did.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche told me all about it.
SUPFEMALE:She made it up.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:Look, nothing came of it.
LEADMALE:I did apologize to her.
LEADFEMALE:And you lied to me.
LEADMALE:Dorothy! You lied to me about Blanche! Dorothy, sweetheart, please try to understand.
LEADMALE:It was no big deal.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you think so? I probably lost one of my best friends because of you.
LEADFEMALE:To me, that's a very big deal.
LEADFEMALE:I take it we're not playing golf.
OTHERMALE:We're not playing anything anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll call you in a few days when you've cooled down.
OTHERMALE:Don't bother.
LEADMALE:I really have nothing to say to you.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm so sorry, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm the one who's sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I have to go talk to Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I've been an idiot through this whole thing! Darn right you have! - (knock on door - Come in.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it's you.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Blanche, we have to talk.
SUPMALE:I don't have anything to say to you, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Then let me do the talking.
OTHERFEMALE:Elliot was just here and he told me the truth about what happened.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I hate to say "I told you so," but I did.
LEADMALE:I told you so! Honey, I'm sorry for not believing you.
SUPFEMALE:There's no excuse for my behavior.
SUPMALE:There most certainly isn't.
LEADMALE:I guess when it came down to it, I didn't believe you because I didn't want to.
LEADMALE:Nobody ever believes me when I'm telling the truth.
OTHERMALE:I guess it's the curse of being a devastatingly beautiful woman.
SUPMALE:Oh, please! The only other woman who could possibly understand is Priscilla Presley and Susan Anton.
SUPMALE:No, not Susan Anton.
LEADMALE:Even my husband didn't believe me on our wedding night - when I told him he was the first.
SUPFEMALE:But George wasn't your first.
SUPFEMALE:Well, he didn't know that! The point is, he didn't believe me.
LEADMALE:Look, Blanche Blanche, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think you can ever forgive me? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I have to think about it.
OTHERMALE:I understand.
SUPFEMALE:OK, I've thought about it.
SUPFEMALE:I forgive you! Oh, Blanche, Blanche, thank you! Oh, what the heck! That's what friendship's all about.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, Dorothy! Oh, I'm so glad you made up.
LEADMALE:I knew you couldn't stay mad for long.
OTHERMALE:Of course we couldn't.
LEADMALE:Oh, it takes a big woman to forgive somebody calling her a slut! You! Fight over? Good.
LEADFEMALE:Here, taste these.
LEADFEMALE:I'm conducting a pizza challenge.
SUPFEMALE:One of these is mine, one is Mama you-know-who's.
LEADMALE:Taste them and tell me which you like better.
LEADMALE:If I'm right, this could be worth millions.
LEADMALE:My face could be in every freezer in America.
LEADMALE:Mmm.
LEADFEMALE:A, definitely.
LEADMALE:Mmm.
OTHERMALE:Yep, A.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, A.
LEADFEMALE:A, without a doubt.
LEADFEMALE:You can't pick men and you can't pick pizza! 
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Why do these things always happen to me? I'm just a wreck.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know what I'm gonna do! Blanche, we go through this every morning.
SUPMALE:Now admit it, you have cellulite.
SUPMALE:I am not talking about cellulite which I don't have.
SUPMALE:I'm talking about my daughter Janet.
LEADMALE:I just got off the phone with her.
LEADFEMALE:She's having marital troubles.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, I'm so sorry.
SUPFEMALE:But they've decided to try and work things out, so they're going to Hawaii for a second honeymoon.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like they're trying to work it out.
LEADMALE:Why are you upset? Don't you listen? She has cellulite.
LEADMALE:Those are dimples.
OTHERFEMALE:Dimples are on these cheeks! - Ma! I am upset because while they're in Hawaii for two weeks, they're leaving my Oh, Blanche, that's wonderful news! Why, you shouldn't be upset.
LEADMALE:No, I should be upset.
LEADMALE:How am I supposed to study for my French final with a 14-year-old in the house? It's hard enough with an 80-year-old.
LEADFEMALE:Are you referring to me? - Of course not, Ma.
SUPMALE:I'm referring to Cary Grant.
SUPMALE:He's living in the broom closet.
SUPMALE:Hey, it's Blanche's grandson.
LEADFEMALE:We do for family.
OTHERMALE:You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:I'm just being selfish.
OTHERMALE:It probably won't be too bad.
SUPMALE:No, I suppose not.
LEADFEMALE:But whatever will we do with him for two weeks? There are plenty of things to do down here.
LEADMALE:We can take him to Disneyworld, the Seaquarium, the Everglades, Rambo - Rambo? - The movie with Sly Stallone.
OTHERMALE:I sat through it twice.
LEADFEMALE:You'll love it! He sweats like a pig and he doesn't put his shirt on! It's not gonna work.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not sharing my room.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Ma, Ma I'm not thrilled with the arrangement either.
LEADMALE:But for the two weeks that David is here, we'll make do.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, it's easy for you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not the one who snores.
LEADFEMALE:I do not snore.
SUPFEMALE:Please! I'll bet less disgusting noises come out of Ernest Borgnine! I just fixed a special treat for David.
LEADMALE:It's the same little after-school snack I used to make for my own son - a triple-decker BLT, a hearty helping of homemade potato salad, and a great big slice of double chocolate fudge cake.
LEADMALE:Oh, where was he going after school? The electric chair? Oh, girls! What's the matter? Where's David? I don't know where he is.
SUPFEMALE:He wasn't on the plane.
LEADMALE:Come on, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:I'll help you move your things back to your room.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Ma.
SUPMALE:Please! Come on, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Now calm down, calm down.
LEADFEMALE:He probably missed the plane.
LEADMALE:It can happen to anyone.
SUPFEMALE:I missed a plane once.
OTHERMALE:And a train - Rose, you miss a lot of things.
SUPFEMALE:He got on the plane all right.
SUPFEMALE:I checked with the airline.
SUPMALE:You probably just missed each other at the airport.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I was standing there at the gate from the moment the first passenger got off.
SUPFEMALE:I paged him.
SUPFEMALE:I checked with airport security.
OTHERMALE:I called the police.
LEADMALE:(doorbell Oh.
SUPMALE:David! Oh, David! - Grandma! - Is this your kid? - Honey, what happened to you? It wasn't my fault, I promise.
OTHERFEMALE:He stowed away in the airplane lavatory when they landed in Miami and the authorities picked him up in the duty-free shop in Freeport.
LEADMALE:You went to the Bahamas? - I went to the bathroom! The next thing I know, I'm in the Bahamas.
LEADFEMALE:I figured while I was there, I'd buy some perfume for you and your friends in the duty-free shop.
SUPMALE:David.
SUPFEMALE:I'd keep an eye on this one, lady.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I don't know how to thank you, officer.
LEADFEMALE:But I would like to try.
OTHERMALE:I'm usually at Wally's for happy hour on Tuesdays.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche! - Ma'am.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:David.
SUPMALE:I ought to give you a good talking-to, but I'm just so glad you're all right, I'm willing to overlook this little incident.
SUPMALE:Come on, I want you to meet my friends.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, David.
LEADMALE:I'm Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:This is Rose.
OTHERMALE:Hello, David.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, what's happening? This is Sophia.
LEADMALE:Oh, we've just been so anxious to meet you! Yeah, I'll believe that if you believe the Bahamas story.
OTHERMALE:You know, David, I went to the Bahamas once.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Was it on the Nina, the Pinta, or the Santa Maria? It was a DC-10.
LEADMALE:I don't think it had a name.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's very funny, Rose.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I'm gonna grab a bite to eat.
OTHERFEMALE:I passed this burger joint around the corner.
SUPMALE:Looked like there might be some kids there.
LEADMALE:Oh, but David, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:You just got here.
LEADFEMALE:I'd really prefer you to stay.
OTHERFEMALE:I planned a special meal for you, David.
LEADFEMALE:Tomorrow.
SUPMALE:I love leftovers.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what time will you be back? Hard to say.
SUPMALE:It depends how late the guys from Miami Vice want to party.
LEADMALE:Later! Well, I don't believe that! But then what can I expect? His father's a Yankee.
SUPMALE:I guess I should've given him some money.
LEADFEMALE:You should've given him a smack.
LEADMALE:Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't believe in hitting children.
SUPMALE:Personally, I like to lay into a kid with a melon baller.
LEADMALE:It's got a nice weight, good balance in the hand.
SUPFEMALE:And it's portable.
SUPMALE:My father used to punish us by sending us to the dairy barn to milk Alice.
LEADMALE:Well, what's so terrible about that? - You had to milk Alice sitting on a stool.
SUPMALE:I thought you always milked a cow sitting on a stool.
LEADMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:Alice had to sit on a stool.
LEADMALE:You see, she was involved in this nasty plowing accident.
LEADFEMALE:It was during spring planting and Daddy had hitched her up to the plow 'cause poor old Toby had gotten a fever and gone deaf Rose, Rose, Rose Sweetheart, save the story.
LEADFEMALE:When David comes back, tell him.
LEADMALE:That can be his punishment.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, what are you doing? - Living.
SUPFEMALE:Pardonnez-moi.
SUPMALE:I just can't study with the noise! - Fine, I'll stop breathing.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, I haven't studied since David arrived.
LEADMALE:My test is My test is in two weeks and I do not want to blow it.
LEADMALE:You'll pass.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to pass.
SUPMALE:I want an A.
OTHERFEMALE:You're the same as you were in grade school - A's.
OTHERFEMALE:You always had to get an A.
LEADFEMALE:You're brother thought a book was to sit on.
OTHERMALE:You always had to get an A.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, Ma.
LEADMALE:If I breathe and it bothers you, put a pillow over my face.
LEADFEMALE:How could I sleep with that racket? - What racket? - Your pencil.
LEADMALE:My pencil? - You're pressing too hard.
LEADFEMALE:It's making me crazy! I give up.
LEADMALE:Look at me.
OTHERFEMALE:What? - You're getting a cold.
SUPFEMALE:No, I'm not.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, you are.
LEADFEMALE:Tomorrow, you'll have a cold.
LEADFEMALE:What is this? The curse of the catwoman? - I'm a mother, I know these things.
LEADMALE:Good night, Ma.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:What's that smell? I don't smell anything.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you wearing something? A little Ben Gay on my knees.
LEADFEMALE:A little Vicks on my chest.
LEADMALE:A little Deep Heat on my neck.
LEADMALE:What are you trying to do, pickle yourself so you'll live to be 100? Fine, I'll wipe it off.
OTHERFEMALE:Tomorrow, I'll be in a wheelchair.
LEADMALE:Goodnight, Ma.
OTHERMALE:Goodnight.
LEADFEMALE:Keep it up, I'll need a Dramamine.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm trying to get comfortable.
LEADMALE:Not me.
LEADFEMALE:You get too comfortable, you don't wake up! - Goodnight, Ma.
LEADMALE:Goodnight.
SUPFEMALE:(snorting and clearing throat - Ma.
LEADMALE:What? That noise.
LEADFEMALE:What noise? The noise you're making with your nose and throat.
OTHERFEMALE:I got a postnasal drip.
LEADFEMALE:What would you like me to do, drown in phlegm? - Good night, Ma.
SUPMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:You know, we haven't slept together since I was a little girl.
OTHERMALE:Thank God.
OTHERFEMALE:I used to get into your bed whenever I had that dream about the bear.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:The bear dream.
OTHERFEMALE:I hated that dream.
LEADFEMALE:A bear is eating you.
LEADFEMALE:What's to love? You were so cute.
LEADMALE:You were always so polite when you woke me.
LEADFEMALE:"Mommy, I'm having a bad dream.
OTHERMALE:Could I come in?" I felt so safe with you.
SUPMALE:Listen, I felt safe with you when you were three.
SUPFEMALE:And you always used to smell from Midnight in Paris perfume.
LEADMALE:Better than this, huh? - It sure was nice.
LEADMALE:It still is.
LEADMALE:Good night, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, pussycat.
OTHERFEMALE:What in the world is going on here? David, I said, what in the world is going on here? I thought you were in bed! I couldn't sleep, so I went out and got a pizza.
LEADFEMALE:Made a few friends and we decided to have a party.
SUPFEMALE:David, this is an inconvenience.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, it is 2:00 in the morning.
SUPFEMALE:Now please, ask your fr friends to leave.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, girls.
SUPMALE:Relax, loosen up! Hey, life's too short.
SUPFEMALE:Especially for you guys.
SUPFEMALE:David! - I'll get the melon baller.
LEADMALE:Take it easy, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:Don't get your support hose in a knot.
LEADMALE:That does it! The party is over! Everybody out, out! Not you.
SUPFEMALE:Out! It's really been lovely.
SUPFEMALE:And if anything is missing, I will give your names to every narc in this city.
OTHERMALE:Oh! David, clean up this mess, then go to bed.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, why don't you clean up the mess yourself? What's the big deal? We were just having some fun.
OTHERFEMALE:You know that those happen to be my friends you just threw out? You know, this really stinks.
LEADMALE:What am I supposed to do for the next two weeks, just sit around and listen to your arteries harden? You stop that! You know something? I am having a real problem with your attitude! Oh, really? Well, you can all just kiss my attitude! Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you wouldn't let me get the melon baller, so I improvised.
SUPMALE:Is that all you Italians know how to do, scream and hit? No, we also know how to make love and sing opera.
SUPMALE:Mom, you had no right to hit him.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, I'm so sorry.
LEADFEMALE:She should not have done that.
LEADMALE:Well, I have to go talk to David.
LEADMALE:I feel just awful about this.
LEADMALE:This is like The Long Day's Journey Into Light.
OTHERMALE:Night.
LEADMALE:Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Night, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:David, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that nobody ever hit me before.
LEADMALE:I think I should go home.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you can't go home.
LEADFEMALE:There's nobody there to take care of you.
LEADMALE:That's OK.
LEADFEMALE:I'd rather be there alone than trapped here with you.
SUPMALE:Besides, I can take care of myself.
LEADFEMALE:I've been doing it long enough.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? All Mom and Dad ever do is fight.
LEADMALE:They don't even know I exist.
LEADFEMALE:Have you tried telling them how you feel? - They wouldn't listen.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm listening.
LEADMALE:Only because they dumped me on you and you feel you have to.
OTHERFEMALE:No, David.
LEADMALE:You don't have to! Just leave me alone! "Trim the hedges, mow the lawn, paint the patio furniture, wash the windows, clean out the garage, scrub the denture cup.
LEADFEMALE:" I added that.
SUPMALE:I hate doing it.
LEADFEMALE:This is too much.
SUPFEMALE:I can't ask him to do this.
SUPMALE:Of course you can.
OTHERMALE:Idle hands are the devil's workshop.
SUPFEMALE:God, I wish I'd said that.
LEADMALE:I don't see how doing all these chores is gonna make him feel loved.
LEADMALE:Look, Blanche, the one thing that David has never had in his life is structure.
LEADFEMALE:Doing chores will give him a little responsibility.
SUPFEMALE:He might even start feeling good about himself.
LEADFEMALE:And start hating me if I ask him to do all this! Listen, Blanche, you do what is best for David, not what is easiest for you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we had chores on the farm.
LEADFEMALE:Boys and girls.
SUPFEMALE:When we finished, we had such a feeling of accomplishment.
LEADFEMALE:We had to feed the chickens, slop the hogs, muck the stalls.
LEADMALE:Please, I'm trying to eat here! And after I finished all that, I still had to take care of Larry, my one-eyed pig.
LEADMALE:What did you people do, run a farm for handicapped animals? But you grew up in the country.
LEADMALE:David's a city boy.
LEADMALE:Oh, wait now, Blanche, come on.
LEADMALE:I'm from New York.
LEADFEMALE:I did chores.
LEADFEMALE:I made the beds, I washed the dishes, scoured the pots, cleaned the bathroom, folded the laundry, took out the garbage.
LEADMALE:My, my.
OTHERMALE:Did you attend a military school? No, she lived with me.
LEADMALE:Did they have chores in Sicily? - Are you kidding? They invented chores in Sicily.
SUPMALE:Crossing the street without getting pregnant was a chore in Sicily.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, never mention Sicily.
LEADMALE:Oh I guess when I was little, I didn't have to do anything.
LEADFEMALE:And I raised my daughter the same way.
LEADFEMALE:So that's why David is the way he is now.
LEADFEMALE:So it's all my fault! Oh, now, Blanche.
LEADMALE:You can't blame yourself for David.
LEADMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:It's my mother's fault.
LEADFEMALE:I am gonna give this list to David and see that he starts right away.
LEADMALE:How is it possible to get pregnant in Sicily just by crossing the street? - Cheap Chianti and narrow streets.
OTHERMALE:Oh If you wait a couple of minutes, I'll make you some sandwiches.
SUPMALE:Where you going? - I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:How you getting there? - I'll take a bus.
LEADFEMALE:I see.
SUPFEMALE:And when the bus gets to you-don't-know-where, - what will you do then? - Get a job.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? - Yeah.
SUPMALE:As what, Secretary of State? - I gotta go.
SUPMALE:So you're just gonna wimp out, huh? - I'm not wimping out.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you call this? Why should I stay here when I got all this crappy stuff to do? And no one likes me anyway.
SUPMALE:You know, first of all, buddy boy, life is full of crappy stuff to do.
LEADMALE:It's everywhere, so you better get used to it.
LEADFEMALE:The President has crappy stuff to do.
LEADFEMALE:Second of all, your grandmother happens to like you.
LEADFEMALE:My mother likes you.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't hit anyone unless she really cares.
LEADFEMALE:Take it from me.
OTHERMALE:And I happen to like you.
LEADMALE:My life stinks.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:Things are tough at home and that really does stink.
SUPFEMALE:But you have a choice.
LEADFEMALE:You can tough it out or you can let it beat you.
SUPFEMALE:But right now you're here, and this doesn't have to stink.
SUPMALE:And if you stay and work at it and everything turns out, you'll have a place to visit when the things at home really get to stink.
LEADMALE:I just can't, like, come here whenever.
LEADMALE:You can just, like, come here whenever.
LEADMALE:Well, I don't mind the gardening.
LEADMALE:But it's, like, the vacuuming I hate.
SUPMALE:That's, like, for girls.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we can renegotiate.
LEADMALE:I'll do the vacuuming if you'II, like, learn English.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, I'll fix you something to eat.
LEADFEMALE:All right, now, attention, everyone.
LEADFEMALE:I want to propose a toast.
LEADFEMALE:To Dorothy Zbornak, who got an A in her French class, proving that you can teach an old dog new tricks.
SUPMALE:And if anyone knows about tricks - Ma! Thank you, ladies and gentleman.
OTHERMALE:Or should I say, merci beaucoup.
SUPMALE:mes amies.
LEADMALE:Oh, my, that was impressive! Jane Goodall once taught an ape to rhumba - that's impressive! Now, I would like to propose a toast.
LEADMALE:To David, who in the past week has proven that he is one damn good kid.
SUPFEMALE:Hear, hear.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's really been interesting.
OTHERMALE:I got hit, did chores, learned all about handicapped animals.
SUPFEMALE:All in all, it hasn't been half-bad.
LEADMALE:And if it's all right with you, I wouldn't mind living here full-time.
LEADFEMALE:I would certainly have to discuss that with your parents.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mom and Dad will say yes.
LEADFEMALE:They'll be as happy with the idea as I am.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm gonna get some ice cream.
SUPFEMALE:Wait up! I'll show you where I hide the good stuff.
LEADMALE:Call his mother! - Blanche, what are we gonna do? - Do you think I should call his mother? - I really think you should.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I will.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to send him back to an unhappy home, but we're grandmothers.
LEADFEMALE:It wouldn't be fair to be this old and have to raise children.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, baby, it's Mama! Well, I'm fine, honey, I'm just fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'm calling you about David.
LEADFEMALE:No, he's fine.
LEADFEMALE:Matter of fact, he's so happy here, Janet, that I've decided to keep him and raise him myself.
LEADMALE:You heard me.
SUPMALE:He says that you and Michael spend so much time arguing, that you don't have time for him.
OTHERMALE:Don't you take that tone with me, missy.
LEADMALE:Yes, I realize you're his mother No, I don't suppose I can stop you if you insist on coming and getting him.
SUPFEMALE:But you let me tell you this.
LEADFEMALE:If you and Michael don't straighten up and give that boy the love and attention he deserves, I will kick your uppity butt till hell won't have it again! She'll call us right back.
OTHERMALE:She has to wake up the Yankee.
LEADMALE:Well done, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, absolutely.
OTHERMALE:Nice bluff.
OTHERFEMALE:That was no bluff.
SUPMALE:I meant every word of it.
SUPFEMALE:I would love to have a chance to raise David.
SUPMALE:I might make up for the mess I made with Janet.
LEADMALE:I still wish you'd let us drive you to the airport.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my cab's already here.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, I've seen the way you all drive.
SUPMALE:Oh! I'm gonna miss you guys.
SUPMALE:It was nice of your folks to let you join them in Hawaii.
SUPMALE:Yeah, they've never ignored me on an island before.
SUPMALE:David, you listen to me.
SUPMALE:They want the three of you to start over from scratch, so the least you can do is meet them halfway.
SUPFEMALE:I'll try.
LEADFEMALE:I bet it'll be easier than you think.
OTHERFEMALE:Especially now that you have an alternative.
LEADMALE:If things get too tough at home, you can always come here and live with us.
LEADFEMALE:Well - Bye, Grandma.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Bye, love.
SUPMALE:Rose.
SUPMALE:See ya, slugger.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, darling.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Run, run, run! Go.
LEADMALE:Oh, I hope he's gonna be all right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy that was so sweet of you, telling him he could come live with us.
LEADFEMALE:I meant it! It's gonna be awfully quiet around here without him.
LEADMALE:I'll say.
SUPFEMALE:No more listening to Dorothy snore! Ma, I do not snore! Please, I had to turn you from the window so you wouldn't inhale the drapes! 
LEADMALE:
OTHERMALE:Ma, what smells so great? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Just a little spaghetti sauce I threw together.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
SUPMALE:This is your special 14-hour sauce.
LEADFEMALE:What's the occasion?
LEADFEMALE:Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:You haven't made this sauce since Uncle Dominic married off that daughter of his.
LEADMALE:You know, the one who looks like Tony Bennett? Now tell me what's going on.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm.
LEADMALE:I told you, nothing.
SUPMALE:Oh, Sophia, that smells heavenly! Is it Chef Boyardee? Stick it in my heart, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:It'll hurt less.
LEADMALE:Oh, girls! I cannot believe how extravagant I've been! It cost too much money, but when I saw it in the window, I had to have it.
SUPMALE:What?
LEADMALE:Look at this.
SUPMALE:What do you think about that? It's hard to tell, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:We'd need to see both earrings on.
LEADFEMALE:You silly.
OTHERMALE:I bought it to help Rose and me win the bowling tournament this year.
OTHERFEMALE:You think you have a shot at the trophy? I thought the Nielsen twins were unbeatable.
OTHERMALE:I don't really care whether we win or not.
SUPFEMALE:I just like to have fun.
OTHERMALE:And we sure had a good time last year, didn't we, partner? It was OK.
LEADMALE:You know, maybe I should get a partner and enter that tournament.
SUPFEMALE:I used to be a pretty decent bowler.
LEADFEMALE:Decent bowler? You were a fabulous bowler
LEADFEMALE:180 average.
LEADMALE:180?
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Come on, Ma, you were always a better bowler than I was.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I do everything better than you.
LEADMALE:Mmm.
OTHERMALE:If this sauce was a person, I'd get naked and make love to it.
SUPMALE:God, I love you.
LEADMALE:Hey, Ma? Ma, you know that doubles bowling tournament is next weekend.
LEADFEMALE:What do you say you and I team up and enter, huh? No, I can't.
SUPFEMALE:I'm too busy.
SUPMALE:I'm sure I could find you a partner, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:You're too busy doing what? Here.
LEADMALE:"Will be in Miami Thursday.
LEADFEMALE:Hope to see you.
SUPFEMALE:Respectfully yours, Augustine Bagatelli.
OTHERMALE:" Who is Augustine Bagatelli? Nobody.
LEADFEMALE:Just a boy I knew from my village in Sicily that I was engaged to once.
SUPMALE:What? Well, what do you know? Sophia has a past! That's right, but unlike yours, I didn't need penicillin to get through it.
OTHERMALE:Ma, you never told me you were engaged.
SUPFEMALE:What happened? The war happened.
OTHERFEMALE:Augustine went off to fight and I never heard from him again until today.
LEADMALE:I wonder why he looked you up after all this time? Are you kidding? He was crazy about me.
SUPFEMALE:I was the only girl in the village who didn't want to be a nun.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey!
SUPFEMALE:How do I look?
SUPFEMALE:Like a widow in mourning.
LEADFEMALE:Perfect.
LEADFEMALE:He'll know I'm available.
OTHERMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Sophia, did your friend die? Rose, he hasn't come here yet.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, you certainly look black.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, did you get me a partner for the bowling tournament?
OTHERMALE:Sure did.
LEADMALE:You're all signed up.
LEADFEMALE:(doorbell
SUPMALE:It's him!
SUPMALE:Want me to get it? No, if he sees me sitting, he'll think I have arthritis!
OTHERFEMALE:Sophia?
OTHERMALE:Augustine? You shrunk! Hello, I'm Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Sophia's daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Augustine Bagatelli.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure you two have a great deal to catch up on.
LEADMALE:Nice to have met you.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma, I'll be right here in the kitchen in case he gets fresh.
SUPMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:So, uh, what's new?
LEADFEMALE:Not much.
OTHERFEMALE:You?
LEADFEMALE:Not much.
LEADFEMALE:My condolences on your husband's passing.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:I've been in mourning 22 years.
LEADMALE:My wife's been dead 31 years.
LEADMALE:Philomena Del Nero, she was from our village.
LEADFEMALE:Is she the one whose father used to stand outside of town, drink Chianti,
LEADFEMALE:and play with a top all day?
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:He lived with us for two years after we get married.
SUPFEMALE:Thank God he drank himself to death.
LEADMALE:You feel like going for a walk?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'd love it! Thank you, thank you.
SUPMALE:This is so cute! I think they're going for a walk.
LEADMALE:Rose, get away from that door.
LEADFEMALE:I can't help it.
SUPFEMALE:I just think it's amazing that a man would look up his first love after all these years.
LEADMALE:Well, I wonder why Italian men are so romantic.
LEADFEMALE:It's the tight pants, Rose.
LEADMALE:So who did you sign me up to bowl with? Oh, I wanted to talk to you about that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I am stunned! Just stunned! Stunned is the only way to describe how stunned I am! Just a minute, just a minute, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Are you trying to tell us that you are stunned? Don't you make fun of me, Dorothy Zbornak! I just saw the signup sheet down at the bowling alley.
LEADFEMALE:Rose dumped me as her partner! And then the two of you signed up together.
LEADMALE:I did it.
LEADMALE:Dorothy's a better bowler than you are and I want to win this year! Rose, how could you do a thing like this? I admit it.
LEADFEMALE:I have a problem.
SUPFEMALE:I'm too competitive when it comes to athletics.
OTHERMALE:I've never told anybody this, but I had to transfer high schools because of a field hockey incident.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, that was a terrible thing to do, dumping Blanche.
OTHERMALE:I'm not gonna be your partner.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, I want you all to stay partners.
LEADMALE:I've already got another partner.
LEADFEMALE:I signed up with Olga Nielsen.
OTHERMALE:Ha-ha.
OTHERFEMALE:Olga Nielsen! Oh, that's impossible! Olga always bowls with her twin sister Sonja! That was before Olga found out Sonja's been sleeping with her boyfriend Lars, and not telling him he had the wrong sister.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Rose Nyland, I can't wait to whip your butt! Olga Nielsen is a terrific bowler! They could beat us! There is no "us," Rose.
LEADMALE:I am not bowling with you! Oh, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:I don't ask many favors of you, but I'm asking one now.
SUPMALE:I'm begging.
LEADFEMALE:Please, as a friend, be my partner.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche has somebody to bowl with.
LEADFEMALE:You want somebody to bowl with.
SUPFEMALE:I need somebody to bowl with.
SUPMALE:Please, just say yes and nobody will get hurt.
LEADMALE:Oh all right! Unless we don't win Hi! Oh, hi, Ma.
LEADMALE:Where you been? I took Augie to that cafeteria in the mall.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
SUPFEMALE:You and Augie have been seeing a lot of each other
LEADFEMALE:these past few days.
SUPMALE:Yeah, we've been having a lot of fun.
LEADFEMALE:Augie's a terrific guy.
OTHERFEMALE:And a gentleman! Every time I leave the table, he tries to stand up.
LEADMALE:It's a shame he has to go back to Sicily so soon.
OTHERFEMALE:It would have been nice if the two of you had more time together.
SUPFEMALE:I'm glad you said that because he wants me to go back with him.
OTHERFEMALE:What? Not for good.
OTHERMALE:Just for the San Genero festival.
OTHERMALE:That's where we met, 65 years ago.
LEADFEMALE:I want to go back.
LEADMALE:Oh, gee, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, honey, but I can't let you go.
LEADMALE:Who's asking your permission? I'm going anyway.
SUPMALE:Ma, look, I absolutely forbid it! Come on, you've had a stroke, you have high blood pressure.
LEADMALE:It would be lunacy to risk your health this way! Listen, you are not the woman you used to be.
SUPMALE:I'd feel terrible if something happened to you.
LEADFEMALE:At my age, I can't worry about that.
SUPFEMALE:This is special.
OTHERMALE:I've made up my mind! I'm going.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, then I'm wasting my breath.
SUPFEMALE:You're a grown woman.
LEADFEMALE:I can't tell you what to do.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Now lend me $1,200 for the airfare.
SUPFEMALE:Non che pensa del I can't believe you're denying your own mother.
LEADFEMALE:Denying her what? Springsteen tickets, Rose.
LEADMALE:Will you please stay out of this? Dorothy's trying to keep Augustine and me apart.
OTHERMALE:That absolutely adorable man? Dorothy, how could you? Oh, Rose, you're such a good person.
LEADFEMALE:Many, many times I wished you were my daughter.
SUPMALE:Ma, please.
LEADFEMALE:And you, Dorothy, are a tall disappointment.
LEADMALE:I can understand why Rose is dumping you as her bowling partner.
SUPFEMALE:Rose is dumping Blanche.
SUPMALE:She is not dumping me.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes she is.
LEADMALE:I heard her on the phone! Your mother's right, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:You begged me to be your partner and now you're dumping me? You and I could never beat Blanche and Olga Nielsen! That's why I had to team up with her sister Sonja.
LEADMALE:I need to win, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:And let's face it, you are no Sonja Nielsen! Rose, get professional help.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I am devastated! Just devastated!
OTHERFEMALE:Devastated!
LEADMALE:Oh, knock it off! You are not gonna believe what happened! Those Nielsen twins are back together.
SUPMALE:What?!
SUPFEMALE:Lars Lindquist, the man they were fighting over
LEADMALE:he's dead.
LEADMALE:Found slumped over a desk at his Volvo dealership.
SUPFEMALE:When the girls found out about it, they decided to forgive each other.
LEADMALE:Now they're back together in the tournament! Oh, gee, Blanche.
LEADMALE:It's too bad you won't have anybody to bowl with now.
LEADMALE:We better get down to the alley for some practice, partner.
SUPMALE:Forget it Rose.
SUPMALE:I am dumping you! Blanche, how would you like me to be your partner? Oh, I would love it! Dorothy, you can't do this.
SUPMALE:Now I don't have a partner.
LEADMALE:Yes, you do.
LEADMALE:I'll be your partner, Rose.
LEADMALE:Ma! You think I can't take care of myself? You think I'm too feeble to go to Sicily? I'll show you who's not the woman she used to be!
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Blanche!
LEADFEMALE:I'm Rose.
SUPMALE:Simple mistake.
LEADFEMALE:Means nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, let's go! Come on, Blanche, let's go! Blanche, wake up.
SUPFEMALE:My wife will be home any minute.
LEADMALE:Oh! Where's my shoes? Oh, Dorothy, that was a terrible thing to do! I'm sorry, but we have to get down to the bowling alley.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's 6:00 am.
SUPMALE:Why are you making me do this? You have to go! The bowling tournament is tomorrow.
SUPMALE:Now, we need the practice!
SUPMALE:Oh, we practiced enough! Every morning before work, every evening after work.
LEADFEMALE:All I ever wanted was to look cute in my bowling outfit.
SUPMALE:Honey, aren't you forgetting something? Rose dumped you! That's right! She did.
LEADMALE:I hate being dumped.
LEADFEMALE:I just hate it.
SUPMALE:I haven't been dumped since Wade Honeycutt threw me over for Rebecca Wilkinson, a girl who did not value her reputation.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you let him get away with it?
SUPFEMALE:Hell, no!
LEADFEMALE:What did you do?
SUPMALE:Slept with his brother.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, partner.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go get even! Oh, please, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I'm 55 and Rose has six brothers! I'm talking about the bowling alley.
LEADFEMALE:I mean down at the bowling Shh.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want them to know we're sneaking in all this extra practice.
OTHERMALE:Oh, right.
LEADMALE:Morning!
LEADMALE:Aha, morning.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you two are up kinda early.
SUPMALE:But not as early as you two.
OTHERFEMALE:But then again, you need the practice.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, if you're so sure of yourself, how about a little side bet? What did you have in mind? If I win, you'll lend me the money to fly to Sicily with Augie.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:All right, fine.
LEADFEMALE:But if I win, I get those antique silver earrings that you never let me borrow.
LEADFEMALE:You're on!
LEADMALE:Come on, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, do you want to have a side bet with me? Well, I would Rose, but everything you own is so damn ugly.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I can't wait to whip your butt! Now here we are, alley number seven.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, number seven! That's my favorite!
OTHERFEMALE:I'm so glad we got number seven.
LEADFEMALE:You're not superstitious? No, it's adjacent to the men's locker room.
LEADFEMALE:When that door opens, you can see right in there.
LEADFEMALE:Who cares, Blanche.
SUPMALE:We have more important things on our minds.
SUPMALE:Take a load off, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:We're here, alley number seven.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute, what are you all doing here? We're supposed to be sharing this alley with the Nielsen twins.
LEADMALE:They had to drop out to go to Lars' funeral.
OTHERMALE:I thought Lars' funeral was yesterday.
LEADMALE:It was, but he requested an authentic Viking funeral and every time they tried to set him and his ship on fire, the Coast Guard kept putting it out.
SUPFEMALE:They had to reschedule for today.
LEADMALE:Look at that! I don't believe that! Look at what they have on! Oh, calm down, honey.
LEADMALE:They're just trying to get to you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh!
OTHERMALE:Rose, take that off.
SUPFEMALE:What? You are wearing my bowling outfit.
SUPFEMALE:Why, I do believe you're right.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't worry about it, honey, nobody will notice.
LEADFEMALE:It looks so different on a woman with a full bosom.
LEADMALE:Don't you throw your bosom in my face! Blanche, Blanche, don't you see what's happening? They are resorting to cheap tricks because they know we're better than they are.
OTHERMALE:Now honey, all we have to do to win is just stay cool, calm and collected.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Oh, did you find a ball that's comfortable, Ma?
OTHERFEMALE:What did you call her?
LEADMALE:Ma.
LEADFEMALE:We've grown very close the last few days.
LEADMALE:Now listen, no one calls her "Ma" except me.
SUPFEMALE:You got that? Have I made that clear? Dorothy, Dorothy, calm down, calm down.
LEADMALE:What did I tell you? I knew it would get under her skin.
SUPMALE:All right, everybody's started except us.
LEADFEMALE:Could we please begin? OK, I'm up.
LEADMALE:Strike.
LEADMALE:Mark it down.
OTHERMALE:The ball hasn't even gotten there yet! Look, all you've got is a one, two, three, four,
SUPMALE:five, six, seven, eight, nine
LEADMALE:Darn! Strike! Mark it down.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:You go get 'em, darlin'.
SUPMALE:Go get 'em good.
SUPMALE:Nothing to it.
SUPMALE:As I told you before, all we have to do to win is just stay calm, cool, and collected.
LEADFEMALE:Another hot dog, Ma? Darn! I left three pins.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe it! Ha-ha! I can't believe you can swing that ball past your hip.
LEADMALE:Rose, everyone is finished and I checked the score.
LEADMALE:If you can pick up a spare in the last frame, we'll be leading the tournament! Consider it done, Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:Go to it.
LEADMALE:I did it! I did it! We're in the lead! We're gonna win! We're gonna win! We're gonna win! Rose, Rose, aren't you forgetting something? We haven't bowled our last frame yet.
LEADMALE:We can still win.
LEADFEMALE:And we will.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:You see, I've bowled with Blanche before.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe this isn't the best time to mention it, but when the chips are down, Blanche chokes.
SUPMALE:Don't you, sweetheart? Eat chalk, Nylund.
SUPMALE:You go get 'em, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Blanche? Blanche? I'm fine.
LEADMALE:I just feel a little cold and clammy and just a little short of breath.
LEADMALE:Now you just settle down, you hear me? Settle down.
LEADMALE:Don't make me do this, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:This ball feels like it weighs about 100 pounds.
LEADMALE:Honey, I sympathize with you.
OTHERMALE:Anyone who has ever competed understands what you're going through.
OTHERMALE:Listen, sweetheart, if you don't feel like bowling, you don't have to.
OTHERMALE:Oh, good.
SUPFEMALE:You just hold onto the ball and I'll throw you down the alley.
LEADMALE:This is embarrassing! Get back out there! No, I don't want to.
OTHERFEMALE:I just hate bowling.
OTHERFEMALE:All I ever wanted to do is look cute in my new outfit.
OTHERMALE:We all look cute in your new outfit! Oh, that does it! Ha! I did it! I did it! You did what? You knocked down two pins! It's a personal triumph.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we're not out of it yet.
LEADMALE:All we need to win is a spare.
OTHERMALE:Sophia!
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Augie!
SUPMALE:Did you win? Can you go?
SUPMALE:I don't know yet.
LEADFEMALE:Strike! No, you left the nine pin.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, easy spare.
SUPFEMALE:I've made this shot 100 times.
SUPFEMALE:Your daughter is a very good player, Sophia.
LEADMALE:She must have picked it up from you, huh?
LEADFEMALE:How do you know I'm a good bowler?
LEADFEMALE:Because you were so good at bocce ball.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, we played together once? Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:After the grape harvest.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, that was a nice afternoon.
SUPMALE:Very nice.
LEADFEMALE:You know what else was nice about that day?
OTHERMALE:That was my first kiss.
LEADFEMALE:Mine too.
SUPMALE:Go get 'em, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Whip their butts.
LEADFEMALE:Oh!
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, a gutter ball! A gutter ball! We won! We won! I won! I won! You lost and I won!
SUPMALE:You lost the bet.
LEADFEMALE:That means I'm going.
LEADFEMALE:You go, honey, and with my blessing.
LEADFEMALE:I'm touched.
LEADFEMALE:Do I have your 1200 bucks? You have my blessing and you have my money.
SUPFEMALE:For another thousand, I could go first class.
LEADMALE:Arrivadercil So Augie and I took a bus to Palermo to look up our old friend Teresa DiFino.
LEADMALE:We spent two hours on the bus.
LEADFEMALE:Another hour looking for her house.
LEADFEMALE:We finally find the house, knock on the door, and what do you know? She died.
SUPMALE:Ma, it happens.
OTHERMALE:That morning! Yeah, but aside from that.
LEADMALE:You and Augie really had a great time, huh? The best.
OTHERMALE:Going home brought back a lot of nice memories.
LEADFEMALE:And at my age, it's nice to have someone to share it with.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I almost forgot.
OTHERFEMALE:Here, this is for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Your antique earrings.
OTHERMALE:They're yours.
OTHERFEMALE:You won 'em fair and square.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you talking about? You and Rose won that tournament.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:You blew it on purpose.
SUPMALE:The nine pin for the spare is your best shot.
OTHERMALE:You could make that shot all day long.
LEADMALE:Here, enjoy them.
LEADFEMALE:OK, OK, I gotta unpack.
SUPFEMALE:I got a valise full of clams about to go bad.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Don't talk to me.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Don't talk to me.
LEADFEMALE:I know you're both still angry with me and you have every right to be, but I hope you can forgive me for the way I acted.
LEADMALE:Winning doesn't mean anything if it means losing your two best friends.
LEADMALE:Besides, we all bowled well this year.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I had all our names engraved on this trophy.
LEADMALE:In my opinion, we're all winners.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:What a sweet thing to do.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Rose, can I ask you a question?
LEADMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Why is your name three times larger than ours? Because I'm the one who actually won it.
LEADFEMALE:If you ever want to look at it, it'll be in my bedroom.
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPMALE:Bye, y'all.
LEADFEMALE:And drive carefully.
SUPFEMALE:This wind is terrible.
SUPFEMALE:See you next week.
LEADFEMALE:Bye! Goodbye!
OTHERMALE:Oh!
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what a party! Oh, Ma, I tell you, that meal was absolutely incredible.
LEADMALE:Oh, it was fantastic, Sophia, really fantastic.
SUPMALE:I know, I know.
LEADFEMALE:Did you see that Emma Jane eat?
LEADFEMALE:Oh! I could not believe my eyes! That woman must weigh 275 pounds.
LEADFEMALE:She never stopped shoving it in.
LEADFEMALE:And then she had to talk the entire time.
LEADMALE:She just sprayed food all over the table, like a mist! I got it in my hair.
LEADMALE:It was hitting me like pellets.
LEADFEMALE:I got a piece of rice in my eye.
LEADFEMALE:She could have put my eye out.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I never had food like that in my life.
LEADMALE:Now, I spent a summer in Italy four years ago.
OTHERFEMALE:I never ate this well.
LEADFEMALE:'Course, I never ate.
SUPMALE:Who'd have the time or the energy, if you get my drift.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Oh, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Italian men are just the sexiest, most romantic, most gorgeous men in the world.
SUPMALE:Of course they worshipped me because I'm blonde and feminine and young, with a great body.
SUPFEMALE:What mirror do you use? Oh, Sophia, now, you've done enough.
LEADMALE:Girls, we're doing the dishes.
SUPFEMALE:You just sit.
SUPFEMALE:Fine with me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm exhausted.
SUPMALE:I've been cooking for two days.
OTHERFEMALE:I offered to help you, Sophia, but you said "no.
LEADMALE:" You're Scandinavian.
SUPMALE:What do you know, a thousand ways to make herring? Well, not a thousand, but a lot, and I'm famous for my Lindstrom surprise.
SUPFEMALE:What in the world is that?
LEADFEMALE:Herring pie.
LEADFEMALE:The surprise is, you think it's pie, like apple, but when you bite into it, it's herring! Oh, what fun! It was.
LEADMALE:My cat was named Lindstrom.
OTHERMALE:I used to make it for him on his birthday and other holidays.
SUPMALE:Wait, your last name was Lindstrom.
OTHERFEMALE:You named your cat Lindstrom Lindstrom? Yes, it was less confusing for him.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna clear the stuff from inside.
LEADMALE:She's something.
SUPMALE:A real pistol.
OTHERMALE:The energy she has
SUPFEMALE:look at this meal she made.
LEADMALE:It's just incredible.
LEADMALE:You know, she's starting to clear up.
LEADFEMALE:We can't let her do that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:She's done enough for one night.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, now listen
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy.
LEADFEMALE:I ate too much scungilli.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter?
LEADFEMALE:I got a bubble.
SUPMALE:Why are you rubbing your chest?
SUPMALE:The bubble is in my chest.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean, you have a bubble? Is it pain? If it was pain, I'd call it pain.
SUPMALE:I have a bubble.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, do you know what a bubble is? I know what a bauble is.
LEADMALE:I know what it is.
SUPMALE:I've had a bubble.
LEADFEMALE:In your head.
LEADMALE:A bubble is something that just sits there and presses until it's chased away by a you-know-what.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:What, Rose, a highway patrolman?
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:What? A big belch.
OTHERMALE:You couldn't say "belch"? What is it, a Viking curse? Well, it's not the nicest word in the world.
LEADMALE:Right now, it would be the nicest sound in the world.
LEADMALE:Ma, you know, you don't look good.
SUPFEMALE:I'm short and I'm old.
OTHERMALE:What did you expect, Princess Di?
LEADMALE:I think we should call the doctor.
LEADFEMALE:I don't need a doctor! Blanche, would you call, please? The number's by my bed
OTHERMALE:Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Harris.
LEADMALE:I hate doctors.
SUPFEMALE:The only doctor I ever liked was Dr.
SUPMALE:Clyde, our vet.
SUPMALE:He was wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:My mother wanted him to do her hysterectomy, but he wouldn't.
LEADMALE:But he was willing to do her lobotomy.
OTHERMALE:Ooh!
SUPFEMALE:What, Ma? What?
LEADFEMALE:Pain.
SUPMALE:What kind of pain?
LEADFEMALE:The kind that hurts.
LEADMALE:Ma, lie down.
OTHERMALE:Just lie down.
LEADFEMALE:What if I'm having a heart attack?
LEADFEMALE:You're not having a heart attack.
SUPFEMALE:How do you know? You're not a doctor.
LEADMALE:Why do you think you're having a heart attack? I'm 80 years old, I got Pavarotti sitting on my chest, odds are it's a heart attack! The doctor was out.
LEADFEMALE:They're trying to locate him, so I called the paramedics
SUPMALE:and they're on the way.
LEADMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, do we have heart disease in our family?
SUPMALE:No, Ma.
SUPMALE:How did Uncle Mario die? Don't you remember? He was carrying out the garbage and dropped his gun, and it went off and shot him in the forehead.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, right.
OTHERMALE:What a klutz.
OTHERMALE:Didn't Aunt Teresa have a heart attack? Aunt Teresa didn't have a heart.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Nunzio? Uncle Nunzio died to get away from Aunt Teresa.
OTHERFEMALE:My mother died of old age and my father fell off a donkey,
LEADFEMALE:so we got healthy hearts in our family.
LEADMALE:Very, very healthy.
LEADFEMALE:That's good.
LEADFEMALE:That's a good thing.
LEADFEMALE:There shouldn't be heart attacks or cancer, or anything like that.
LEADMALE:There should just be a certain age where you have to turn your life in, like a library book.
LEADMALE:You pack a bag, you go, and that's that.
SUPFEMALE:I wouldn't know what to pack.
SUPMALE:The real question is, do they have dry cleaners there? Oh, dry cleaners die.
LEADFEMALE:There's probably a slew of dry cleaners.
LEADFEMALE:Will you two please shut up?
SUPFEMALE:Oh! I'm s
LEADMALE:How about if I make coffee?
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Good idea.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Rose.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'll come help.
LEADFEMALE:What if I die, Dorothy?
LEADMALE:Ma, you're not going to die.
SUPMALE:Now, look.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want you to talk, just rest.
LEADMALE:Rest? I could be history in 20 minutes.
SUPFEMALE:I got some things I have to tell you.
LEADMALE:The key to my safe-deposit box
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma, please! Don't interrupt.
SUPFEMALE:Don't let your Aunt Renata come to the services.
LEADMALE:It's my death.
LEADMALE:She'll make it her moment.
LEADMALE:Ma, look
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, you were always my favorite.
LEADMALE:I want you to know that.
LEADMALE:Maybe I didn't show it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not an affectionate person.
SUPFEMALE:But you are.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't tell your sister, and keep the silver.
SUPFEMALE:OK, Ma.
SUPMALE:You know, I'll probably see your father in heaven.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't seen him in 30 years.
LEADFEMALE:I wish there was time to get my hair done.
LEADMALE:Maybe it isn't a heart attack.
SUPMALE:She's 80.
LEADMALE:At 80, something's got to go.
LEADMALE:Well, not necessarily.
LEADMALE:My grandparents lived till their 90s.
OTHERMALE:One was 102.
LEADMALE:In Minnesota.
OTHERFEMALE:So? Rose, you know how they freeze dead people to preserve them and then bring them back? That's like living in Minnesota.
SUPFEMALE:The cold slows down the aging process.
SUPFEMALE:I would move there in a shot if only they had men there.
LEADMALE:We have men in Minnesota.
OTHERFEMALE:Farmers, Rose.
SUPMALE:Farmers.
SUPFEMALE:I'm an idiot!
LEADFEMALE:Why?
SUPFEMALE:I didn't think this would happen.
SUPMALE:What? Death.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't really think I'd die.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, maybe someday, but not today.
LEADFEMALE:It could be today, and you know what? I'm not ready.
LEADMALE:as a complete surprise.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you're OK.
LEADFEMALE:You are not going to die.
LEADMALE:I don't want to.
LEADFEMALE:Who does? You know, I'd settle for even just one more day.
OTHERFEMALE:God knows why.
LEADFEMALE:Tomorrow I'm cleaning the closets.
SUPMALE:Ma, I love you.
LEADMALE:You know what, Dorothy?
SUPFEMALE:What?
SUPFEMALE:Death sucks.
LEADFEMALE:Do you want to be buried or cremated?
LEADFEMALE:Neither.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want to be, flushed down the toilet like a goldfish? I wouldn't want to be cremated.
OTHERFEMALE:I hate heat.
OTHERFEMALE:And burial? I hate small spaces.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm a little claustrophobic.
LEADMALE:Rose, you're not gonna know anything.
SUPFEMALE:You're gonna be dead.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then, burial, I guess.
LEADMALE:But will you promise to put a blanket in with me?
SUPMALE:Why?
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I'd just feel more comfortable cozier.
LEADMALE:And I'd want my pictures of Charlie and the animals.
LEADFEMALE:You know, the ones in the little silver frames.
LEADMALE:And-And my pictures of the children.
LEADFEMALE:And, of course, if I'm married again, I'd want a picture of my new husband.
LEADFEMALE:And the candlesticks Mama gave me
SUPFEMALE:Rose, it's a coffin, not a condo.
SUPMALE:This is a very depressing conversation.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I want a fancy funeral.
LEADMALE:I want a big parade with a riderless horse.
LEADMALE:And I want to lie in state, and then be buried in Arlington Cemetery.
SUPFEMALE:Why Arlington Cemetery?
SUPFEMALE:Because it's full of men.
LEADMALE:But they're all dead.
OTHERMALE:So are the men I date.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm sorry I never tried acting.
OTHERFEMALE:I always wanted to act.
OTHERMALE:Coffee's ready.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thanks, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Sophia, you feeling a little better?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God, she's
OTHERMALE:I'm not dead, I'm resting.
LEADMALE:Of course you're not dead.
LEADMALE:Not yet.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma.
SUPMALE:Don't "Ma" me.
LEADFEMALE:Listen.
SUPFEMALE:Before you know it, I could be gone, and we won't have said some important stuff.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Just remember that I love you very, very much.
SUPMALE:And I love you, Ma very, very much.
OTHERFEMALE:I couldn't love you more.
LEADMALE:And you two, Heckle and Jeckle.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you for letting me live here.
LEADMALE:It was some treat.
SUPFEMALE:You made an old lady feel young again.
OTHERFEMALE:You're OK.
SUPMALE:We love you, Sophia.
LEADMALE:We sure do.
SUPMALE:This is nice, to die with friends.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna close my eyes now, but I'm only resting.
OTHERMALE:Oh God, where are the paramedics? I'll go call them again.
LEADMALE:Rose, you stay with Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, she'll be fine.
LEADMALE:I'm sure it isn't a heart attack.
LEADMALE:A heart attack's bigger.
OTHERFEMALE:I've seen a heart attack.
LEADFEMALE:Charlie had a heart attack.
LEADMALE:And it wasn't like this?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it was much worse.
SUPFEMALE:If only the paramedics would get here.
LEADFEMALE:Charlie made me dress him when he had his heart attack, before the paramedics got there.
LEADFEMALE:What, he wasn't dressed? We were making love.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose, honey, you never told me.
OTHERMALE:He died while you were making love? He didn't die then.
LEADMALE:He had his heart attack then and he told me to dress him.
OTHERFEMALE:And?
LEADMALE:And I dressed him.
LEADFEMALE:And then we had a fight.
SUPMALE:I grabbed a pair of white pants and I was putting them on him, and Charlie said it was after Labor Day and he couldn't wear white.
OTHERMALE:In the middle of a heart attack? Oh, Charlie was very stubborn and very dapper.
SUPMALE:And then what happened? And he told me he loved me and then it was over.
LEADFEMALE:And I put a pair of gray flannel pants on him and a blue shirt, and striped tie.
SUPMALE:And he was all dressed when the paramedics got there.
LEADMALE:Girls, come here a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, it's gonna be awhile.
LEADFEMALE:There's lots of trees down and accidents because of the storm, so the paramedics can't get through right away.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we have to do something.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, she needs help.
SUPMALE:We can drive her.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:The hospital's 20 minutes from here.
SUPFEMALE:If the paramedics can't get through, what makes you think we can? We could get out there and get stuck.
LEADFEMALE:I think we ought to just wait for help.
LEADMALE:But she could be dying! But what can we do? Pray.
LEADFEMALE:Wait and pray.
LEADMALE:Aah! What, Ma? What? What? You're sitting on top of me, I open my eyes, I see pores like that, I think I'm on the moon.
LEADFEMALE:Did you have a nice nap, Sophia? I didn't have a nap.
OTHERFEMALE:I died a little.
OTHERFEMALE:I went to heaven.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:You just slept, is all.
OTHERFEMALE:You were there? Don't tell me where I went.
OTHERMALE:I went to heaven.
SUPFEMALE:I saw the golden light and some angels in white robes with harps.
LEADMALE:I thought I was in Saks at Christmas, but then I saw your father.
LEADFEMALE:Really?
LEADFEMALE:He was surrounded by women.
LEADMALE:He's in heaven.
SUPMALE:Did you see God and Jesus?
LEADFEMALE:They were busy.
SUPFEMALE:I think I'll go back.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, don't go.
SUPMALE:No, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:It's a wonderful place.
LEADMALE:I'm very excited about it.
LEADMALE:Ma, I want you here.
LEADMALE:Sophia, are there lots of men in heaven?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I'd like to know.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, get me my rosary.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:What about men? Are there lots of men in heaven?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, come on!
SUPFEMALE:You asked her about God and Jesus.
SUPFEMALE:Is there anything else we can get you, Sophia? A little tea, perhaps? I'm not in England.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm having a heart attack.
SUPMALE:Keep her company.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna help Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, you know, I always thought there'd be a Catholic heaven, with nuns and priests and churches.
LEADFEMALE:And then a separate, Protestant heaven, with people and cows and horses.
LEADMALE:And then a Jewish heaven, with libraries and furriers and You're starting to annoy me.
OTHERFEMALE:You shouldn't annoy a sick person.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Sophia, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just trying to help.
SUPMALE:You want to help? Be quiet.
LEADMALE:I'll be quiet, but just don't close your eyes all right? Don't-Don't close your eyes.
SUPMALE:Did you find them?
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, Blanche, what if she dies? She's a tough lady, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:If anyone's a survivor, she is.
SUPFEMALE:If she dies, I'll be an orphan.
SUPMALE:Can you believe it? I'm over 50 years old, and I'll still feel like an orphan.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Oh, it doesn't matter.
SUPFEMALE:You lose a parent, you might as well be six.
LEADFEMALE:It's scary, and it pushes you right up to the head of the line.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, God, I don't know what I'll do.
LEADFEMALE:I love that lady so much.
LEADMALE:She's my family.
OTHERMALE:We're your family too, Dorothy, and you remember that.
LEADMALE:We might not be blood, but we're here.
SUPMALE:Oh God, I miss her already.
LEADMALE:So there I was with no vet, and Petunia was about to give birth to her piglets.
SUPMALE:Well, I just didn't know what to do.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I had helped deliver Bessie the cow, but Petunia was so much more difficult.
LEADMALE:She- If I died, would you stop telling this story? Sophia, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I was just trying to get your mind off things.
LEADFEMALE:I want my mind on things.
SUPFEMALE:I've got to make my peace, and I need some peace to do it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be quiet.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Here are your beads, Ma.
SUPMALE:I found them in a can of peanut brittle.
SUPFEMALE:Of course.
SUPFEMALE:That's where I keep them.
OTHERFEMALE:(doorbell
LEADFEMALE:Oh, the paramedics.
LEADFEMALE:Do I have lipstick on my teeth? Oh, Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Harris, thank God you're here.
SUPFEMALE:Here she is.
LEADMALE:So, what's this, Sophia? I hear we're not feeling well.
LEADMALE:We? What are you, a partner?
LEADFEMALE:Where's the pain?
LEADMALE:My heart.
LEADFEMALE:Show me where.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:You hungry? You want some food? We got a lot left over.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, fix him a plate.
OTHERFEMALE:Later, Ma.
LEADMALE:Now, breathe normally.
LEADMALE:I could be dead.
OTHERFEMALE:I won't know whether he liked it.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, please.
LEADFEMALE:I can't hear and I ate at my mother's.
SUPFEMALE:What did you eat?
LEADMALE:Kreplach.
SUPMALE:You're Jewish?
SUPFEMALE:All right now, relax.
LEADFEMALE:How come so many doctors are Jewish? Because their mothers are.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, oh, oh, oh.
LEADMALE:Did that hurt? No, I'm singing rock 'n' roll.
LEADFEMALE:Of course it hurts!
OTHERFEMALE:What did you have for dinner?
SUPFEMALE:I didn't have any dinner.
LEADMALE:All right, tell me everything you ate today.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:A little of this, a little of that.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, she had scungilli.
LEADMALE:And I saw her eat some sausages and peppers.
LEADMALE:I saw her eat some fettuccine Alfredo,
LEADMALE:and fried mozzarella.
OTHERMALE:Are you kidding? And then this afternoon she had the cannelloni and the mushrooms with Gorgonzola.
LEADFEMALE:Bring him a plate of those.
SUPFEMALE:Those were great.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, go! Oh, and the Milk Duds, remember? You had those two boxes of Milk Duds.
LEADMALE:Milk Duds? They're delicious.
LEADFEMALE:I love them.
LEADFEMALE:The trouble is, they take out my dentures.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, I don't think you're having a heart attack.
LEADMALE:It's most likely a gallbladder attack, brought on by overeating.
LEADFEMALE:Overeating, by the way, is a gross understatement for what you've described to me.
SUPFEMALE:You simply cannot go on eating like that at your age! You can't eat like that at any age.
LEADMALE:But she didn't have a heart attack, you're absolutely sure? I've got a portable EKG machine in the car.
SUPFEMALE:I'll double-check, but it doesn't seem like a heart attack.
LEADMALE:She's got classic gallbladder symptoms
LEADFEMALE:a tenderness in the upper right quadrant, a slight discoloration of the whites of her eyes.
SUPFEMALE:Try this.
LEADMALE:Tell me you're not in heaven.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, I can't, really.
LEADMALE:One bite, for God's sake! Isn't it a little rude for him to be eating while she's having a heart attack? She's not having a heart attack.
SUPFEMALE:Mmm.
LEADFEMALE:That's good.
SUPFEMALE:Give me one of those.
LEADFEMALE:Hide this stuff!
LEADFEMALE:Where shall I hide it?
SUPMALE:In your brassiere, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Just throw it away.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna get the EKG machine.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
SUPMALE:I'll call the paramedics and tell them not to come.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thanks, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, is he single or what? Or what.
LEADFEMALE:Happily?
LEADFEMALE:Happily.
LEADFEMALE:Damn.
LEADMALE:Boy, what a relief.
LEADMALE:You're telling me.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I was a goner.
OTHERMALE:It's incredible.
LEADFEMALE:You think you're dying, you feel death enter your body.
SUPFEMALE:The doctor comes, he says you're fine, you're ready to swim the English Channel.
OTHERMALE:I can't tell you how happy I am.
LEADFEMALE:I want you around for a long, long time.
LEADFEMALE:They'll have to murder me.
LEADMALE:Though, I must admit, I was a little excited about seeing your father again.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, you feeling OK?
SUPFEMALE:I'll live.
SUPMALE:Listen, I'm sorry if I scared you.
OTHERMALE:Honey, don't worry about it.
LEADMALE:I'm just thrilled that you're OK and 'cause I'm happy that, you know, I'm your favorite.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about, favorite? You know, you told me that I'm your favorite.
OTHERFEMALE:Please! What favorite? Are you kidding? I thought I was dying.
LEADFEMALE:Favorite? Boy, what a night.
OTHERFEMALE:You said it.
LEADMALE:It sure makes you think.
SUPMALE:Sure does.
OTHERMALE:About what? About our policy in Guatemala.
LEADFEMALE:About death, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, death.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you prepared either of you? I mean, really prepared for death? For somebody else's death.
SUPFEMALE:I have a stunning black dress.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, if I've thought about it
LEADMALE:you know, the fact that I will die
OTHERMALE:then how can I take seriously most of the things I take seriously?
LEADMALE:Like?
SUPMALE:Like eating, for example.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, why starve myself to the point of thinness if I know that I could die tomorrow? I mean, why not eat the chocolate cake?
OTHERMALE:What chocolate cake?
LEADFEMALE:The chocolate cake in the refrigerator.
SUPMALE:You know, you have a point, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Here we are, not eating chocolate cake, which we obviously adore, because we want to stay very thin, and then drop dead.
LEADMALE:That's nuts.
LEADFEMALE:But we might be thin and stay alive.
OTHERFEMALE:But not forever, Rose.
OTHERMALE:We're not gonna stay alive forever.
LEADFEMALE:That's Dorothy's point.
LEADMALE:And when you're gonna die anyhow, what's it matter? Yeah, I mean, what does it matter if you know that you're gonna end up dying anyway? You might as well do what you want to do.
LEADMALE:Like having ice cream on the chocolate cake.
SUPMALE:You know, I knew someone who went to this fabulous restaurant in Paris and just had watercress for lunch because, you know, she didn't want to gain weight.
OTHERMALE:And then after lunch, she walked out of the restaurant and a gargoyle fell off the building, hit her on the head, and killed her.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Look at what her last meal was.
LEADFEMALE:That is tragic, just tragic.
SUPFEMALE:Here, honey, dig in.
SUPFEMALE:'Course, it will be just my luck.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll eat, I'll gain 40 pounds, and live to be 90.
SUPMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:I'm healthy as a horse.
LEADMALE:Unfortunately, I'll wind up looking like one.
SUPMALE:All it takes is one little dessert and my panties cut off my circulation.
LEADFEMALE:I pass.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not touching that.
SUPFEMALE:I put on 12 pounds just from dinner alone.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go for a walk.
SUPMALE:Right, burn it off.
SUPMALE:Are you kidding? After what we ate, we'd have to walk to Canada.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mounties.
LEADMALE:I love Canadian men! 
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:What do you think?
SUPMALE:I can't decide.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, trust me, Martinique is perfect.
LEADFEMALE:It has everything and all the men speak French.
SUPMALE:What do the women speak?
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, everybody speaks French.
SUPFEMALE:Then we can't go there.
LEADMALE:I don't know any French.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:All you need to know are two phrases
LEADMALE:yes, and no, your roommate can't watch.
SUPMALE:I was thinking maybe some place like Williamsburg, Virginia.
SUPFEMALE:Or maybe Washington, D.
LEADMALE:C.
LEADMALE:You're moving, Rose? Too bad.
SUPFEMALE:This would be touching if I liked you more.
LEADMALE:I'm not moving, Sophia.
SUPMALE:The three of us are planning a vacation together.
LEADFEMALE:Without me? We were hoping that maybe you'd stay here and watch the house.
LEADMALE:Why don't you take the house? I'll stay here and watch the hole in the ground! Hello, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Ma.
OTHERMALE:Brooke Shields takes her mother everywhere!
LEADFEMALE:She just found out about our vacation.
SUPMALE:We thought you were gonna tell her.
SUPFEMALE:I was waiting for the right moment.
LEADMALE:You know, like right after we landed in New York.
LEADMALE:New York? I want to go to an island.
LEADFEMALE:New York is an island.
SUPMALE:No, I mean some place where swarthy men who don't speak English rub oil all over your body.
LEADFEMALE:Great, then we can go for a ride on the subway.
SUPFEMALE:Stan's here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:What is he doing here? He needs my signature on some papers so I told him he could stop by.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Where is he? I left him on the doorstep.
LEADMALE:I wanted the neighbors to see what a bacia-galoop you married.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be back in a minute.
LEADMALE:Where is this vacation spot that doesn't allow mothers? Look, Ma, please.
SUPFEMALE:We'll discuss this after Stan leaves.
SUPMALE:What's to discuss? You're leaving me behind to guard the house like an old watchdog.
LEADMALE:I hope a neighbor comes by to give me fresh water.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Stan.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, hello.
SUPFEMALE:You look fantastic.
SUPFEMALE:Please, please, Stan.
LEADMALE:No hugging, no kissing.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just do it and get it over with.
OTHERMALE:Sounds like the last few years of our marriage.
OTHERFEMALE:I wish it was that good.
OTHERFEMALE:It wasn't that bad.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:The important thing is that it's over.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on in.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:So, did you bring the young chippy with you? Ma, come on, you're talking about his wife.
LEADMALE:So did you bring the bimbo? Chrissy's back in Maui.
SUPFEMALE:I just came to sell a piece of property that Dorothy and I bought when we were in Miami on our honeymoon.
OTHERMALE:Just sign on the last page.
OTHERMALE:Read it first.
SUPFEMALE:The last time he had you sign something, I ended up in a home.
LEADMALE:Relax.
SUPMALE:It's just property where Dorothy and I talked about retiring someday.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute, Stan.
SUPMALE:I can't sign this now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, babe.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought everything was agreed.
LEADFEMALE:But this has to be signed in front of a notary public and don't call me babe.
LEADMALE:Darn! Can you meet me at a notary's tomorrow?
LEADMALE:Do I have a choice?
SUPMALE:You're beautiful.
SUPMALE:I'll call you in the morning and make the arrangements.
LEADMALE:So long, Sophia! You're beautiful, too.
LEADMALE:Why did I ever marry that man?
LEADFEMALE:Because he knocked you up.
LEADMALE:Why did I ever let that happen?
SUPFEMALE:'Cause he got you drunk.
LEADFEMALE:Why am I even discussing this with you? Beats the hell out of me.
LEADMALE:You sure all you want is coffee? The corned beef here is really primo.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't even want the coffee.
SUPFEMALE:You were the one who said it'd be rude if I didn't join you.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, I thought the little woman had you eating things like sprouts and roots and those green things that grow under boats.
LEADFEMALE:Let's not talk about Chrissy.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
SUPFEMALE:We've had a bitter divorce that time has softened into a hostile relationship.
LEADMALE:Face it, our topics of conversation are limited.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:We just sold a piece of property that we bought on our honeymoon.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you feel a little sentimental? No.
LEADFEMALE:What do you say we take a drive and take one last look at it? Oh, two hours in a car with my ex-husband, looking at a piece of swampland that I don't even own anymore Oh, Stan, you really know how to show a girl a good time.
LEADFEMALE:She left me.
LEADMALE:What?
SUPMALE:Chrissy left me for a younger man.
SUPMALE:Younger than Chrissy? Where did she meet him, Camp Snoopy? I didn't want to say anything.
LEADMALE:What the hell, you deserve to gloat a little.
OTHERFEMALE:I deserve to gloat a lot! But I can't.
SUPMALE:I know what the pain is like and I wouldn't wish it on I don't know how to finish that sentence
LEADFEMALE:I usually say Stan.
OTHERMALE:When did it happen?
LEADMALE:Ah, a couple of months ago.
SUPMALE:She told me she thought we were no longer sexually compatible.
LEADMALE:She didn't say it exactly in those words.
LEADFEMALE:Of course not.
LEADFEMALE:Those words have more than one syllable.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, she found a guy with a few less miles on his surfboard and that was that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I must say, you're taking it fairly well.
SUPFEMALE:It's a front.
OTHERFEMALE:You sure you're not going to say "I told you so?" You're a good person, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:You want some?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, wonderful! Half a pound of cholesterol.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you sure you don't want to go take a ride and look at our swamp? Oh, why not? I mean, the day's shot anyway.
LEADMALE:I'll take you to dinner.
LEADFEMALE:How about that seafood place near the Fontainebleau where we were on our honeymoon? Sure, why not? If memory serves me correctly, the last time, we excused ourselves before the main course
SUPMALE:and rushed back to the hotel.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm If memory serves me, we rushed back to the hotel because you had the runs from that cheap lunch you bought us.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:I don't care what Dorothy says, I'm not spending my vacation in New York.
LEADMALE:It might be interesting.
OTHERMALE:I've never been to New York.
LEADMALE:You haven't, Rose? I'm shocked, you're so cosmopolitan! Take it from me, you're not missing a thing.
SUPFEMALE:The people are rude, the streets are full of criminals, everything's overpriced.
OTHERMALE:I don't know why Frank Sinatra sings about it.
OTHERFEMALE:New Yorkers are all sickos.
SUPFEMALE:We could go to Hollywood.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, good choice.
LEADFEMALE:No sickos there! Sophia, please.
LEADMALE:We're trying to make a very difficult decision here.
LEADMALE:Excuse me! Not only am I not allowed to go, I'm not allowed to talk about it! This is the same deal Cinderella had with her stepsisters! I've always wanted to go to Hollywood.
LEADFEMALE:When I was a young girl, I used to dream about becoming a movie star.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Mason, who owned the corner drugstore, said I was a young Barbara Billingsley.
OTHERMALE:So when I turned 17, I told my father that I wanted to take acting lessons.
LEADFEMALE:What did he say? No.
SUPMALE:Great story, Rose.
SUPMALE:But you know what? Hollywood's not a bad idea.
OTHERMALE:Should we tell Dorothy that we want to go to Hollywood? Why don't we! As soon as she gets up! To Hollywood!
SUPMALE:To Hollywood!
LEADFEMALE:Morning.
LEADMALE:I guess you ladies didn't recognize me without my toupee.
LEADFEMALE:I guess that's it.
LEADMALE:Do you mind if I use the phone? You already used my daughter, you didn't ask for my permission.
LEADMALE:There's a phone in the living room.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:OK, I know what it looks like.
SUPMALE:And frankly, that's exactly what it is.
LEADFEMALE:You had to bring him home? You couldn't find a drunken sailor on a street corner? We're a little surprised, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:You're not alone.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, it was the last thing in the world I expected.
SUPFEMALE:I met him, we went to sign the papers, we had lunch, he told me his wife left him And you believed him? That is the oldest line in the book.
SUPMALE:I hear that at least twice a week!
OTHERMALE:And it works every time.
LEADMALE:I said it was old.
SUPMALE:I didn't say it doesn't work.
LEADMALE:No, believe me, Chrissy left him.
SUPFEMALE:He was devastated.
LEADMALE:Next thing I knew, I was holding him, he was crying, we were in bed.
LEADFEMALE:It was just as it always had been.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm shocked.
LEADFEMALE:I was too.
LEADMALE:You know, Chrissy didn't teach him a thing.
LEADMALE:If he's moving in, I'm moving out.
SUPFEMALE:He is not moving in, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:We are not getting back together.
LEADMALE:It was just one night with a comfortable stranger and that's where it ends.
LEADMALE:Believe me, we both know that.
OTHERMALE:No, you heard me right.
SUPMALE:Six dozen long-stemmed roses.
SUPFEMALE:And the card should read, "To Dorothy and a wonderful new beginning.
LEADFEMALE:" We're gonna talk to the travel agent about Hollywood.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you want to come with us?
LEADFEMALE:No, look, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to spend my vacation sitting in a tour bus, looking at houses that may or may not belong to Lucille Ball.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not spending my vacation in New York getting mugged and groped and insulted.
LEADMALE:I'll be happy to go anywhere they don't spit on Americans.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you come with us?
LEADMALE:I can't.
SUPMALE:Stan called, he's stopping by.
LEADFEMALE:What's he going to do? Bring you some more flowers? You know what I don't understand? I don't understand why he sent you flowers at all.
LEADMALE:I mean, two days ago you hated each other.
OTHERFEMALE:And you know what else I don't understand? I don't understand how two people who go off to a business meeting end up in bed together.
LEADMALE:And you know what else I don't understand? I don't understand why you didn't tell him this morning exactly how you felt.
SUPFEMALE:Is that is, Rose? I mean, are you finished, or is there something else that you don't understand? Well, actually, there is.
SUPFEMALE:I don't understand how a thermos keeps things both hot and cold.
OTHERFEMALE:Neither do I.
LEADFEMALE:But I'll tell you, if ever I sleep with Mr.
SUPMALE:Wizard, I'll find out what I can.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, honey.
LEADMALE:It's just, last night should not have happened, but it did.
LEADMALE:And it obviously means more to Stan than it does to me.
LEADMALE:I mean, right now, he's hurt and he's vulnerable.
SUPMALE:Why didn't you tell him that this morning? I was too shocked and I didn't know how to tell him.
LEADMALE:And to tell the truth, I don't even know what I want to tell him.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you mean? I mean that I am totally confused about what I feel.
OTHERMALE:(knock at the door
LEADMALE:Hi, Stan.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Stan.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, Rose, don't leave on my account.
SUPFEMALE:No, they have to.
LEADMALE:They're hitching up the house to the car and entering it in the Rose Parade.
LEADFEMALE:We'll see you all later.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't you like the flowers?
LEADMALE:They're beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:They're absolutely beautiful, but it's too much! I know! I can't believe how expensive roses got since the last time I sent them to you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, everything's gotten more expensive since Truman left office.
LEADFEMALE:Stan, listen, we really have to talk about last night.
SUPFEMALE:We sure do.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you say about us getting back together? Come on in, girls.
SUPFEMALE:See, what did I tell you?
LEADMALE:Ma, what are you doing? I was having a meeting with my vacation club.
OTHERFEMALE:It seems there are a lot of children who like to take vacations without their mothers.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but What are you all doing here? They never heard of a woman going to bed with her ex-husband.
SUPFEMALE:That's him, girls.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't explain it either.
LEADMALE:I think we'd better continue our discussion in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, babe.
OTHERFEMALE:Beautiful.
LEADMALE:Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:You just want us to get back together again? Just like that? I mean, Stan, we're divorced.
SUPFEMALE:Stan, you walked out on me.
LEADFEMALE:You left me for another woman.
LEADFEMALE:I realize I may be rushing things.
SUPMALE:But think about it.
LEADMALE:We had 38 years together.
LEADFEMALE:A lot of it was good.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe one stupid mistake on my part could undo all of that.
LEADMALE:Well, believe it.
LEADFEMALE:It was one hell of a stupid mistake.
LEADMALE:Was I the first guy to ever go through a mid-life crisis and react that way? Probably not.
LEADMALE:But you were the first one I was married to.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, Dorothy, hear me out.
LEADMALE:I know what you're thinking.
LEADMALE:That last night really didn't mean anything.
SUPMALE:But you're wrong.
LEADFEMALE:The fact that it happened at all proves that there's still something between us.
LEADFEMALE:And now we've got a chance to start all over.
SUPFEMALE:We could take that cruise we always talked about.
LEADFEMALE:We could look into that antique shop you always wanted to open.
LEADMALE:We could stop the sale of that property and build the home we always dreamed of.
LEADMALE:There are so many things that we can do together.
LEADMALE:So many things you can't do alone.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't answer me right now.
SUPMALE:Just think about it
LEADMALE:please? Please don't close the door on the rest of our lives.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Took me awhile to realize I always have.
LEADFEMALE:You shouldn't take him back! It's not just my opinion.
LEADMALE:We took a vote.
LEADMALE:Hey, what are you two doing up?
LEADMALE:Waiting for you.
LEADMALE:We thought you might want to talk.
SUPFEMALE:All the food's already on the table.
SUPMALE:We didn't want to waste precious time.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:So, what do you want to talk about? All right, I have not decided what to do about Stan.
OTHERMALE:I mean, how can I just forget all the time that we had together? And then how can I forget the pain and the hatred that I felt when he left me? I I can never trust him again.
LEADFEMALE:If you can't trust your husband, what kind of a relationship can it be? Sounds like you've already made up your mind.
SUPMALE:I guess I have.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I just didn't know it until just now.
LEADMALE:Oh, I wish there was some gentle way to tell him.
SUPMALE:Take it from me, honey.
SUPFEMALE:There is no gentle way to end it with a man.
SUPFEMALE:When you're gentle, they don't get the message.
SUPMALE:Oh, Blanche is so right, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:That was exactly the problem I had with Eddie Parker.
LEADFEMALE:He was this real sweet guy who was crazy about me, but I just didn't feel the same way about him.
LEADMALE:You see, when Charlie went off to war, I went to work for our local USO club.
SUPMALE:And that's where I first met Eddie, the Aqua Midget.
SUPFEMALE:He was a blue midget? Don't be ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:He was a diving midget.
LEADMALE:That was his act.
LEADFEMALE:He used to jump off a step ladder into this gigantic punch bowl.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh what happened? Nothing, he'd just swim to the side and hop out.
LEADMALE:I mean, what happened between you and Eddie? We talked a lot between shows and of course I didn't realize it,
SUPFEMALE:but he was falling for me.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't have far to fall.
LEADFEMALE:It started with little things.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll bet.
LEADFEMALE:Pretty soon the situation got out of control and I tried to let him down gently.
LEADFEMALE:You tried to make it short and sweet? He just wouldn't take no for an answer.
SUPMALE:So I finally just had to tell him straight out that I didn't feel about him the way he felt about me.
LEADMALE:It had nothing to do with his size.
SUPFEMALE:It was simply that I could never become involved with anybody in show business.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what to say.
SUPMALE:And I mean that from the bottom of my heart.
LEADFEMALE:(knock at the door
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Stan.
SUPMALE:Come on in.
OTHERMALE:I ordered up some refreshments.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:After all, this calls for a celebration.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what are we celebrating? The fact that you got free champagne with your room? We are celebrating what you said on the phone.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what did I say? You said, "Stanley, Stanley, could I come to your hotel room? I have to see you.
SUPFEMALE:" Mmm, no, that's not what I said.
SUPFEMALE:I said, "Stanley, Stanley, could I come to your hotel room? I have to see you.
OTHERMALE:" Exactly.
LEADFEMALE:Here you go, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:How about a toast? Look, slow down, Stan.
OTHERMALE:There are a couple of things I'd like to say.
LEADFEMALE:OK, but usually the man makes the toast.
LEADMALE:Uh Stanley, I
SUPFEMALE:(knock at door That must be my socks and underwear coming back from the laundry.
LEADFEMALE:That is one of the biggest drawbacks of being without a wife.
LEADFEMALE:Chrissy? Chrissy! I had to talk to you, Big Stan.
LEADMALE:Why didn't you return my phone calls? I There's nothing to talk about, Chrissy.
LEADMALE:Big Stan?
SUPMALE:Who's she?
LEADMALE:Oh, sorry.
LEADFEMALE:This is my ex-wife, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, this is my soon-to-be ex-wife, Chrissy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:I want you back, Stick Man.
LEADMALE:I need you back.
LEADFEMALE:I was so wrong to think I'd be happier with Jean Paul.
SUPMALE:I realize that now.
SUPMALE:I can't spend another night without you in that big, empty, Ionely, solar-heated waterbed.
LEADMALE:No need to say a word.
SUPFEMALE:I understand.
SUPFEMALE:Here you go, honey.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, wait.
LEADMALE:Chrissy, there is nothing to discuss.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, but Stick Man I mean, the girl flew all the way from Maui.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's all right.
OTHERMALE:I'm a stewardess.
SUPMALE:I fly for free.
SUPMALE:I know, but the thought should count for something.
LEADMALE:Chrissy, something happened here in Miami.
SUPFEMALE:Something that changed the way I feel.
LEADMALE:Listen
LEADMALE:You know, before you
LEADFEMALE:Don't be embarrassed.
LEADFEMALE:Chrissy deserves to hear the truth.
SUPFEMALE:It's all over between us, Chrissy.
SUPFEMALE:This is the woman I love.
LEADFEMALE:Seeing Dorothy again made me realize how superficial my relationship with you really was.
SUPMALE:Sure, the sex was great.
LEADMALE:Terrific, actually.
SUPFEMALE:But it's OK with Dorothy, too.
LEADMALE:And with Dorothy, there is so much more.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Chrissy.
LEADMALE:There's nothing left for us.
SUPFEMALE:The fact is, there wasn't that much there to begin with.
LEADFEMALE:She never could hold her liquor.
SUPFEMALE:Uh Stan, did you really mean what you said about there not being that much between you and Chrissy? That's right.
SUPMALE:I'm glad, because now I don't feel so guilty.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about?
SUPMALE:Stanley I don't feel the same way about us as you do.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding!
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:You know, what happened the other night brought back lovely memories, but I'm not the same woman you walked out on two years ago.
OTHERMALE:My whole life has changed and quite frankly, I like the way it is.
LEADMALE:The fact that I'm on my own now
OTHERFEMALE:My God, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Are you saying you won't take me back? We could never have things the way we used to have, Stan.
OTHERFEMALE:You see You're telling me that you're not gonna take me back? Yes, Stanley, that's right.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me get this straight, you're definitely not gonna take me back? Look, Stanley, I'm sorry Dorothy, I'd like to hear the rest of this, but I've got to get down to the lobby and grab Chrissy before somebody else does.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, terrific sex is better than nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Here's to terrific sex.
LEADFEMALE:And the dumb blonde who's not gonna get any.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:Ma, will you knock it off?
SUPFEMALE:What? "What?" We've been washing glasses for ten minutes.
SUPMALE:We've finished three.
LEADMALE:What's the rush? It's not like you have a date tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Ma.
LEADMALE:It's not like you have a date any night.
LEADFEMALE:Or any day.
LEADMALE:When I find somebody worth going out with, I'll go out with him.
LEADFEMALE:Now, will you please stop nagging me?
OTHERFEMALE:Nagging? Is that what it's called when a mother wants a little happiness for her daughter? I'd like to finish these glasses before Gloria gets here.
LEADMALE:Your sister's not coming till tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:Could I borrow your diamond ring and your pearl necklace and your jade bracelet? Are you planning to come back?
LEADMALE:Some time tomorrow morning.
LEADMALE:Where are you going? Out to dinner with Jason, the director of our community theater.
LEADMALE:He's considering me for the role of Lady Macbeth in Mr.
SUPFEMALE:William Shakespeare's masterpiece Macbeth.
LEADFEMALE:I feel sure after our date, he'll make a decision in my favor.
SUPFEMALE:Come on now, Blanche, you're not just using this guy to get a part in a play.
LEADFEMALE:'Course not, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna let him use me to get a part in a play.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, Blanche, does he have a friend for Dorothy?
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:We know this is last minute.
OTHERFEMALE:So we'll take short, bald, fat.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Sophia, but I've already palmed Rose off on his fat friend.
OTHERMALE:He's a lighting director.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, I've never been out with a fat lighting director.
LEADMALE:What'll we talk about? How should I know, honey? Talk about light bulbs.
SUPFEMALE:That's a good idea.
LEADMALE:Maybe he could explain to me how the three-way bulb works.
OTHERMALE:I've always wondered about that.
LEADFEMALE:I've always wondered about the same thing, Rose.
SUPMALE:That, and what Jane Pauley looks like standing up.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe she can't stand up.
SUPMALE:Maybe Willard has to carry her around the set.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, honey.
LEADFEMALE:We don't want to keep our dates waiting.
SUPMALE:Wait, Blanche, honey, aren't you forgetting something? Oh, no, I never wear underwear.
SUPFEMALE:I mean my jewelry.
LEADMALE:Oh, forget it.
OTHERMALE:Why paint the peacock? Your sister never sits home on a Friday night and she's a widow! Every time I talk to her, she's going out with another guy.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, she calls you three times a year!
SUPFEMALE:She's very busy.
LEADMALE:I'm thrilled she found the time for a visit.
LEADMALE:Ma, why do you always make excuses for her? I don't make excuses for any of my children.
SUPMALE:Except Phil.
LEADMALE:Ma, I think I'll watch TV in my room.
LEADFEMALE:Before you go, before you go, call this number.
OTHERFEMALE:What is it?
OTHERMALE:A phone number.
LEADFEMALE:I met him at the supermarket.
LEADMALE:He asked me to squeeze a melon for him.
LEADMALE:He's missing a few fingers, but everything else seemed to be intact.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, how dare you?
SUPMALE:How dare I what? I was trying to help! Ma, can you get it through your head that I do not need your help? Now please, Ma, get off my back! Who do you think you're talking to? Don't you raise your voice to your mother! Then stop smothering me and give me some space! Space? Fine! Have all the space you want!
LEADMALE:Where are you going?
OTHERMALE:To Mildred's! She's shorter than you.
SUPMALE:She doesn't need so much space! I can't understand why the community theater chose Macbeth for its spring production.
LEADMALE:Jason said that they were planning to do a musical but the accordion player died.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, it's a much bigger challenge playing Lady Macbeth! But Blanche, you don't have the part yet.
LEADFEMALE:You still have to audition.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, I did.
LEADFEMALE:Last night.
OTHERFEMALE:I opened to great reviews.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, everyone.
SUPMALE:Clear out, girls, Dorothy needs her space.
LEADMALE:Ma, don't start with me.
SUPMALE:Now come on, you two, let's put on our happy faces.
SUPFEMALE:It's a beautiful day and Gloria's coming! Why don't you just kiss and make up? Why don't you just blow it out your ditty bag.
LEADFEMALE:(doorbell
LEADMALE:I'll get it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get it!
SUPFEMALE:Ma, I said I'd get it.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want you to get it!
LEADMALE:Let's not argue.
SUPMALE:You get it.
LEADFEMALE:What am I, your servant?
SUPMALE:Hi, Ma!
LEADMALE:Gloria! So good to see you! Dorothy, it's wonderful to see you!
OTHERFEMALE:Honey.
SUPFEMALE:What is this? You gift-wrapped your luggage? Of course not, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:My luggage is at the hotel.
OTHERFEMALE:Those are gifts.
SUPMALE:You're staying at a hotel?
LEADMALE:I didn't want to inconvenience anyone.
LEADFEMALE:What inconvenience? You're my daughter.
OTHERMALE:We shared a body for nine months.
LEADFEMALE:Really, Ma, I'd be more comfortable at a hotel.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Be more comfortable.
OTHERMALE:I hardly see you.
LEADFEMALE:You never come to visit.
LEADMALE:You finally get here, you're staying at a hotel.
LEADMALE:You could have just called.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, do you want me to stay at the house?
LEADFEMALE:Do what you want.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you stay here? You can share my room.
LEADFEMALE:It's certainly easier than arguing with her.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:I'd like you to meet my two dearest friends.
LEADMALE:This is Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:This is Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:My sister, Gloria.
SUPMALE:Welcome to Miami.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, thank you.
SUPMALE:Oh, Gloria, Sophia's told us so much about you.
OTHERMALE:I especially enjoyed the story about your imaginary childhood friend, David, who lived in the oven.
LEADMALE:I had an imaginary friend, but he'd never tell me his name.
SUPMALE:It was during spring planting
OTHERMALE:Rose! Do you mind? Gloria's only staying for a week.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to talk to her before she leaves.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, honey.
LEADMALE:Let's get to that audition.
LEADFEMALE:Gloria, consider this your home.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Nice meeting you both.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll tell you about it later.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:I'll fix us some coffee.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:First, open these.
LEADMALE:Now, there is a new outfit for you and some warm pajamas and an electric blanket.
LEADFEMALE:Every time I call you, it seems you have a cold!
OTHERFEMALE:Call more often!
LEADMALE:Don't pick on your sister.
LEADMALE:Here, she brought you something.
LEADFEMALE:It's a gift certificate for a complete makeover at Elizabeth Arden's.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe now you can get a date.
LEADFEMALE:Please, Ma.
OTHERMALE:I'm not calling Captain Hook.
LEADFEMALE:I am going to freshen up and call my driver.
LEADMALE:Then I'm taking you for lunch and a shopping spree, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:That Gloria's some special kid!
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma, she's your baby.
LEADFEMALE:All mothers think their babies are special.
SUPMALE:That's ridiculous.
LEADMALE:I think all my children are special.
LEADMALE:Except Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, Ma.
LEADMALE:Can I make a little suggestion when you go for your makeover?
LEADMALE:Sure, what is it?
LEADFEMALE:Don't expect a miracle.
LEADFEMALE:Hi! How was the audition?
LEADMALE:Wonderful! I'm 99% sure I got the part! There were so many good people there! Trust me, I got this part in the sack!
SUPMALE:She means in the bag.
LEADMALE:No, honey, she means in the sack.
SUPFEMALE:Where's Sophia?
SUPFEMALE:She and Gloria went shopping.
LEADFEMALE:They haven't come back yet.
LEADMALE:Gloria seems like a lovely person.
OTHERFEMALE:She is a lovely person.
LEADMALE:And she's sophisticated and worldly and wealthy and has never had a pimple in her life.
OTHERMALE:Do I detect a little sibling rivalry?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I don't know.
SUPMALE:I guess I've just always had the feeling that my parents liked Gloria better than they liked me.
LEADFEMALE:I know for a fact my parents liked my sisters better than they did me.
SUPMALE:Oh, Blanche, that's silly! How could you know a thing like that! They told me! Oh, Blanche, I can't believe that your parents told you that! I don't care if they are from the south.
LEADMALE:They didn't tell me in words.
LEADFEMALE:They told me in actions.
LEADMALE:Like on our birthdays.
LEADFEMALE:When we were little, every year, my sisters had huge parties with clowns and magicians and tons of presents.
LEADFEMALE:And you didn't.
SUPMALE:Well, not exactly.
OTHERMALE:I did have parties and I had presents but I never had a clown.
LEADMALE:Not until I was much older.
LEADMALE:much older.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:But that's another story.
SUPMALE:My parents always made each of us feel like we were the favorite.
LEADFEMALE:They loved all nine of us equally.
LEADFEMALE:We used to have the best Christmas Eves.
LEADMALE:Daddy'd sit at Grandma's old player piano and he'd play Christmas carols and the children would sing along, then Mother'd bring in some homemade eggnog and snickerdoodles.
LEADFEMALE:And then we'd decorate the tree.
LEADMALE:And after Daddy'd hung the star at the very top of the tree, we'd all join hands and pray, and then Daddy'd tell us a story and
LEADFEMALE:tuck us into our feather beds
SUPFEMALE:Who was your father? Michael Landon? Can I help it if I came from a happy family? Well, we had our share of problems.
LEADMALE:Believe me, we had some hard times.
LEADMALE:Once a mysterious drifter stole our butter churn.
SUPMALE:Well, I guess Ma and Gloria aren't coming back for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:What say we go out and grab a hamburger? Oh, sounds good to me.
LEADFEMALE:This reminds me of when Daddy used to take us for hamburgers on Saturday night.
LEADFEMALE:We'd grab our dog Binky, and we'd pile into the I hope you're not mad at me for keeping Ma out so late.
LEADFEMALE:Of course not.
LEADMALE:Did the two of you have a good time? Ah, wonderful.
LEADMALE:I like being with Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to spend more time with her.
SUPFEMALE:And I'd like us to get closer, too.
LEADMALE:I wish there was more time.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I see you just packed for the weekend.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:You don't resent me, do you? Don't be silly! Why would I resent you? Oh, please!
LEADFEMALE:For having money?
SUPFEMALE:No, I don't resent you.
LEADMALE:Oh, I did, a great deal, as a matter of fact, but I've outgrown it.
OTHERMALE:Even though my marriage was happy and yours hit the rocks? Well, that bothered me for awhile, but I got over it.
LEADFEMALE:Even though all my children are practicing professionals and yours aren't? Please, Gloria, I'm happy for your children! All except Katherine.
SUPMALE:No, she really should've taken the nose job instead of the Mustang for graduation.
LEADMALE:This reminds me of when we were little, and you used to tell me bedtime stories.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:"The Bogeyman and the Little Girl," "The Zombie in the Hamper," "Cannibal Parents.
LEADMALE:" I think between the ages of five and seven you might've gotten two hours sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you ever come to California to visit me? Well, it's not easy, you know.
OTHERFEMALE:I have my job, I have responsibilities, I've never been invited.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm inviting you now.
LEADFEMALE:I have a huge house with servants and an ocean view.
SUPFEMALE:And Bert Convy shops in my grocery store.
OTHERMALE:Bert Convy? Let's leave now! I was telling Ma about it, you know.
SUPFEMALE:How great the weather is and how she would never have to lift a finger for anything and she really liked the idea of maybe coming out.
LEADFEMALE:It would be great if she were to come out for a visit sometime.
SUPMALE:Well, I was thinking of more than just a visit, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:I was thinking of a permanent arrangement.
SUPMALE:What do you mean?
LEADFEMALE:I want Ma to come live with me.
LEADMALE:So I asked her to and she said yes.
SUPMALE:Hi, Ma.
OTHERMALE:What are you doing?
LEADMALE:Having a toga party.
SUPFEMALE:I'll talk to you when you're not busy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not busy, but do what you have to.
SUPMALE:Gloria tells me you're gonna go live with her.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's best.
LEADMALE:Isn't that kind of a fast decision?
SUPMALE:Why, you think I'm making a mistake? Oh, no, of course not.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you know, not if you think it's best.
LEADMALE:What do you think? Well, I can understand why you'd want to live with her.
SUPFEMALE:She can give you so much more than I can.
LEADMALE:You'd live in a mansion, you'd have servants, you'd do your grocery shopping with Bert Convy.
LEADMALE:And you'll have your space.
LEADMALE:And you can sit home on Friday night and become an old maid like your Aunt Regina and you won't have to listen to me nag.
SUPFEMALE:Then I guess it's all settled.
LEADMALE:I guess so.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'd better get to work.
LEADFEMALE:Ma?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? If you need any help moving, just let me know, OK? I'll do that.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid I have some bad news.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid I have some bad news.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I'm afraid I have some bad news.
LEADMALE:Goodness! I'd better sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy just said she had bad news.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Since you got here first, you go ahead and tell her first.
SUPFEMALE:You go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:No, really.
SUPFEMALE:I insist.
LEADFEMALE:You got here first.
SUPMALE:Girls, please! Will one of you just say something so I can become hysterical, eat a box of Mallomars and get it over with? OK.
OTHERFEMALE:Jason called.
SUPMALE:You got a part in Macbeth.
OTHERMALE:but I'm afraid it isn't the part you were hoping for.
LEADFEMALE:What part did I get? Witch number three.
SUPFEMALE:A witch? He cast me as a witch? Well, who got Lady Macbeth? Don't tell me! Probably one of those little theater groupies with a mattress strapped to her back.
OTHERFEMALE:No, it isn't.
LEADMALE:It's me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! You're pulling my leg!
LEADFEMALE:He picked you over me?
OTHERMALE:Listen, I hate having to Hold on, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:This is a joke, isn't it? He didn't really pick you over me.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, I didn't even want the part, but Jason said I have presence.
SUPMALE:Listen, I really have to go to work
SUPMALE:He actually picked you over me? I do not believe this! I have been had.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:And you still didn't get the part.
OTHERMALE:All right, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I'm ready.
LEADMALE:Now tell me your bad news.
LEADMALE:My mother is leaving.
LEADMALE:She's going to move in with my sister, Gloria.
SUPFEMALE:You're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia can't leave!
LEADMALE:She just can't!
OTHERMALE:She's a grown woman.
LEADFEMALE:She can do anything she wants.
SUPMALE:Why's she leaving? Isn't she happy here? I guess she thinks she'll be happier with Gloria.
LEADMALE:Well, what about us? Who's going to keep after us and make us linguine and tell us stories about Sicily? I don't know, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe Mary Poppins has an Italian cousin.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, do you want her to go?
OTHERFEMALE:Of course not!
LEADMALE:It's breaking my heart!
SUPMALE:I am not gonna let her go without a fight! Me neither! Sophia's like a mother to us all!
SUPMALE:It just wouldn't be the same without her!
LEADFEMALE:But if she wants to live with Gloria, she has every right to do it.
SUPFEMALE:And we have no right to make her feel guilty about it.
SUPMALE:Now I really have to go.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what a terrible morning this is! Sophia's leaving! And I'm playing an ugly old witch 'cause you stole my part! Oh, Blanche, I know how much that part means to you.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I was thinking? You could go on for me one night.
LEADMALE:Well, Rose, isn't that sweet? And I do love you for it, honey, but I just couldn't.
OTHERMALE:I could never fit this trim little body into that big old tent of a dress they're gonna have to make for you.
LEADFEMALE:Does your luggage have to sit in the middle of the room? No, it could also roll over and play dead.
SUPFEMALE:Something bothering you?
LEADMALE:'Course not.
SUPFEMALE:What makes you say that?
LEADFEMALE:Do you want to talk about it?
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:You come here with your limo and your presents and your designer luggage and you think you're better than everybody else.
OTHERMALE:You have everything! Do you have to have Ma, too? I mean, all these years you've been her favorite.
LEADMALE:All I wanted was this time with her.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, you are crazy.
SUPMALE:You're Ma's favorite
LEADFEMALE:you always have been! Come on! You're the one who always got all the attention.
LEADMALE:Sure, I got attention! But only because you were the strongest, the smartest, and you could take care of yourself, which Ma constantly pointed out in English and Italian.
LEADFEMALE:Ma said this about me? Think back, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:When we were kids and Ma and Pop were working,
LEADFEMALE:who did Ma always leave in charge?
SUPMALE:Me.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:And do you know why?
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, because Phil played with matches.
SUPMALE:No, because Ma trusted you with responsibility.
LEADFEMALE:In her eyes, I could never be as good as you! Ma looked at you and saw a wonderful future.
LEADMALE:She looked at me and hoped I would marry rich.
LEADFEMALE:Which I did.
SUPMALE:Very rich.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't she ever say any of this?
LEADMALE:She did.
LEADFEMALE:Who does she turn to whenever she's in trouble, hm? Who did she come to live with? Her favorite
OTHERMALE:you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Gloria.
LEADMALE:That is the dumbest thing I ever heard.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, even with all my money, you have so much more than I do.
LEADFEMALE:You have Ma and your friends and your work and Your life just seems so much more important than mine.
LEADMALE:And I wanted to take a little bit back with me.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not what Ma wants.
LEADMALE:You think she wants to stay? I know she wants to stay.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna go talk to her.
SUPMALE:Are you all right?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure.
LEADFEMALE:I've got all I need.
OTHERFEMALE:And you also have a sister who loves you.
LEADFEMALE:And Pop's nose.
SUPMALE:Ma, you're not leaving.
SUPMALE:You're staying here with Rose and Blanche and me.
OTHERMALE:Hey, if I want to leave, I'll leave.
SUPMALE:I'm free, single, and 80! I'm not gonna take no for an answer.
LEADMALE:You're staying! I should have known you couldn't make it without me.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:I can't.
SUPFEMALE:And neither can Blanche and neither can Rose.
LEADMALE:Of course not, Rose! The woman can hardly find her way to work!
LEADMALE:Then you'll stay?
LEADMALE:Not so fast.
OTHERFEMALE:You're gonna have to make a few changes around here first.
LEADMALE:What kind of changes? Like you can't hang around me all the time.
SUPFEMALE:You need your space
SUPFEMALE:I need mine.
LEADMALE:OK? OK, Ma.
SUPMALE:So maybe I'll stick around and look after you Three Stooges.
LEADFEMALE:Come! Oh, Gloria.
LEADMALE:I just made a very important decision I think you should know about.
LEADFEMALE:What is it, Ma? I decided to stay here in Miami.
SUPFEMALE:I had to, she begged.
SUPMALE:It was pathetic! It's OK, Ma.
LEADMALE:I understand.
OTHERFEMALE:You're a good daughter, Gloria.
LEADFEMALE:You're both good daughters.
LEADFEMALE:Most people my age have children trying to get rid of them.
LEADFEMALE:My children are fighting over who gets to keep me.
LEADMALE:You don't know how much that means to an old lady.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, you don't know how much you mean to us.
LEADMALE:And I love you.
OTHERMALE:I love all my children.
SUPFEMALE:Even Phil?
LEADMALE:Sure, but don't tell him.
SUPMALE:He'll want to borrow money.
LEADMALE:Hi, girls.
OTHERMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:How was dinner? Great.
SUPFEMALE:I ate a lot, Ma drank a lot, Gloria paid a lot.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so glad the three of you got things worked out,
LEADFEMALE:and that Sophia's not leaving.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, me too.
SUPMALE:That spunky little lady sure does add life to this place! Oh, and the stories she tells.
OTHERMALE:And there's always a little gem of wisdom hidden deep, deep, deep inside.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, when I thought I was moving, I was gonna give each one of you a gift,
SUPMALE:but I want you to have them anyway.
LEADMALE:Why, Sophia, how sweet!
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, you shouldn't have!
SUPMALE:Oh, Ma, this is so lovely.
SUPFEMALE:And so familiar.
LEADFEMALE:This is mine.
SUPMALE:I thought the cleaner lost it.
LEADFEMALE:I told you the cleaner lost it.
LEADMALE:I took it
SUPMALE:I needed something to go with my black sweater.
LEADMALE:This is my black sweater.
SUPMALE:I know, it goes great with
SUPFEMALE:My pearls.
LEADMALE:Well, enjoy and be healthy! I wonder if she's seen my umbrella with the duck handle.
LEADMALE:You know, I haven't been able to find my ankle bracelet.
LEADMALE:Come on, I think it's time to search her room again.
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing? What does it look like? I'm putting clam sauce in my suitcase.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, I think they serve a snack on the flight.
LEADMALE:Heh-heh-heh.
LEADFEMALE:You kill me.
SUPMALE:Ma, why are you taking all this food to Phil's? Because the only time your brother's wife goes into the kitchen, it's to get a cold beer.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, she has no time to cook.
OTHERMALE:She works all day.
LEADFEMALE:Welding.
OTHERMALE:My son married a welder.
LEADMALE:Too bad she didn't weld his zipper shut.
LEADMALE:They got ten kids they can't afford.
LEADFEMALE:Grab that.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Ma, now be nice.
OTHERFEMALE:They're looking forward to your visit.
OTHERMALE:The six boys are giving up their bedroom for you! It'll be a miserable week.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know why I'm going.
LEADMALE:Ma, it's your grandson's graduation!
LEADMALE:Big deal.
LEADFEMALE:Animal grooming school.
LEADMALE:He'll know how to make that fluffy ball at the end of a poodle's tail.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, I've just discovered a great new way to meet more men! More men? You're gonna need a turnstile in your bedroom.
OTHERMALE:I enrolled in a CPR class.
SUPMALE:For six consecutive hours, I was on my back while dozens of eligible men pressed their lips to mine and breathed air into my limp little body! So what? You did the same thing at McSorley's Bar Super Bowl weekend.
LEADMALE:How do I look?
SUPMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:Oh, terrific! I'll say! To the untrained eye, that polyester could almost pass for silk!
LEADMALE:It is silk.
LEADMALE:Oh, sure, Rose, and Cheryl Tiegs really buys her clothes at Sears.
LEADFEMALE:So where are you going?
SUPFEMALE:Out with a friend from work.
OTHERFEMALE:The same friend you've been out with five times in the last three weeks?
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:All right, spill it.
SUPFEMALE:Who is he? His name is Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Jonathan Newman.
OTHERFEMALE:He's a psychiatrist at the grief center.
LEADFEMALE:So Rose, you're seeing a psychiatrist? It's about time! The woman gives names to her gingerbread men!
LEADFEMALE:I'm ready to go to the airport.
SUPMALE:I'm going that way.
LEADFEMALE:I can take you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:Wait, you can't run out of here! We want to hear more about this doctor of yours.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, there's not much to tell.
SUPFEMALE:He's a great guy and I like him a lot.
LEADFEMALE:Can't wait to meet him!
OTHERMALE:And his eligible doctor friends! That's right.
LEADMALE:He's very busy, but we'll have him over soon.
LEADMALE:Well, when?
SUPFEMALE:Soon, I promise.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, have a wonderful trip and call me the minute you get there.
LEADMALE:And please, Ma, try not to argue with Phil's wife.
OTHERFEMALE:We get along OK.
LEADFEMALE:Phil's wife has her good points.
LEADMALE:She's sweet, she's reliable, and when her father gets out of prison, she'll be a wealthy woman.
SUPMALE:Let's roll, Rose, I'm leaking clam sauce.
LEADFEMALE:You're angry.
SUPFEMALE:I am not.
OTHERMALE:Yes, I can tell.
SUPMALE:When you're really angry, you purse your little lips so tight, they almost disappear.
LEADMALE:See? Have her lips come out yet?
OTHERFEMALE:Nope, she's still mad at me.
LEADMALE:I'm not mad.
LEADFEMALE:But if I were, I'd have every reason to be.
OTHERMALE:Rose, come on now.
SUPMALE:You're about to swallow your chin.
SUPMALE:It's just that the invitation to dinner should've come from me.
OTHERMALE:I asked you three times in this past week to invite Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Newman to dinner,
SUPFEMALE:and you always put it off.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't put it off.
LEADMALE:I just forgot.
LEADFEMALE:That's why when he called, I invited him myself.
LEADMALE:He says he's looking forward to coming.
OTHERMALE:You should've still asked me first.
LEADMALE:You're right, but he's on his way over.
LEADMALE:We made a terrific dinner.
LEADMALE:So why don't you just relax and enjoy a lovely evening.
LEADFEMALE:You don't understand.
LEADMALE:Jonathan is a very special person.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want you doing or saying anything that would embarrass him.
OTHERMALE:Come on, it's gonna be wonderful.
SUPMALE:Now stop worrying and go check on dinner.
LEADMALE:I can't wait to meet Dr.
LEADMALE:Newman.
SUPMALE:He was fascinating on the phone.
SUPMALE:He analyzed my dream! What dream? That recurring dream I have where I'm running naked through a train that keeps going through tunnel after tunnel, while a sweaty bodybuilder chases me.
SUPMALE:He said he thinks it's sexual.
OTHERFEMALE:He thinks? For God's sake, Blanche, you smoke a cigarette after that dream.
LEADMALE:Not all my dreams are sexual.
SUPMALE:I also dream about food.
LEADFEMALE:'Course, I'm usually naked while I'm eating the food.
SUPMALE:You know, maybe all my dreams are sexual.
SUPFEMALE:Lucky me! Oh, no, thank you, little boy, we already take the Miami Herald.
LEADFEMALE:Who was that? One of the Donaldson boys trying to sell us a newspaper subscription again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, those Donaldson kids won't take no for an answer.
LEADMALE:Neither would their father at our Fourth of July barbecue.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, I'm Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Jonathan Newman.
SUPFEMALE:Are you absolutely sure?
LEADMALE:Yes, may I come in? Oh, please, please.
LEADFEMALE:Please, come right in.
OTHERFEMALE:May I take your height? Hat! Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:You must be Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Rose has told me all about you.
SUPMALE:I wish I could say the same.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, Blanche, this is Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Jonathan Newman.
LEADFEMALE:Get out of here! Blanche.
OTHERMALE:But Dorothy, he's a
LEADFEMALE:A little early, yes, but we're delighted to see him.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Jonathan.
OTHERMALE:Hello, Rose, you're looking lovely this evening.
LEADMALE:Oh, wait a minute! Rose Nyland, you devil, you!
OTHERFEMALE:I just figured out what's going on here!
OTHERMALE:Blanche.
LEADMALE:You were sore at me for inviting your friend without asking you, so you hired this guy to come over and teach me a lesson! You! You God, I wish I was dead.
LEADMALE:Blanche, let's go get the hors d'oeuvres.
SUPMALE:Excuse us.
SUPMALE:I have never been so embarrassed in my entire life!
LEADFEMALE:I made a fool of myself, didn't I?
LEADMALE:Yes! Oh, I feel awful, just awful! Listen, if you don't want tonight to turn into a total disaster, you have to stop being so self-conscious.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, you're right, of course.
LEADMALE:Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Newman is a guest in our home.
LEADFEMALE:If I'm self-conscious, he'll be ill at ease.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't allow that to happen.
LEADMALE:It would be unsouthern.
LEADFEMALE:That's a good belle.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, get the door.
LEADMALE:Shrimp? She's pretty uptight.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna have fun teasing her tonight.
LEADMALE:Why don't we just start dinner?
LEADMALE:Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:What are we having? Short ribs.
LEADMALE:Anyway, you'll never guess what happened.
SUPMALE:I'm sitting in this bar in Nairobi when who do I see? My roommate from Harvard! He decided to go someplace exotic where he didn't know a soul either.
SUPFEMALE:Small world, isn't it? Not from where I'm standing.
LEADMALE:I did it again.
LEADFEMALE:I apologize.
LEADFEMALE:Please forgive me.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, I'm sure he was only joking.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be self-conscious about my height.
SUPMALE:I'm not.
SUPMALE:Really?
LEADMALE:Really! Look, everybody has something about themselves they'd like to change.
LEADFEMALE:The trick is getting beyond it.
SUPFEMALE:Now, don't get me wrong, I'd love to know what it feels like to be the center on the Boston Celtics, but all in all, I'm pretty happy with who I am.
LEADMALE:Oh, God, he gives me goose bumps when he talks like that.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't I fix us all some coffee?
LEADMALE:You've done enough.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get it.
OTHERMALE:I'll help you.
OTHERMALE:What a delightful man.
SUPMALE:You know, he has the most positive attitude of anyone I have ever met.
LEADMALE:And he's wearing the cutest little gray suit I think I've ever seen.
LEADFEMALE:You just can't help yourself, can you, Blanche? I'm home.
LEADMALE:Ma, what are you doing here?
SUPFEMALE:There was no reason to stay.
LEADFEMALE:I thought your grandson's graduation was next week.
SUPMALE:There isn't gonna be a graduation.
SUPMALE:The big dope failed.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you're kidding.
SUPMALE:You wouldn't be surprised if you saw him.
LEADMALE:the whole time I was there was drink beer and shoot cans with a BB gun.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia!
LEADMALE:Oh, um Uh Ma, this is Rose's friend, Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Jonathan Newman.
LEADFEMALE:Dr.
OTHERMALE:Newman, this is my mother, Sophia.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice to meet you, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Nice to meet you too.
SUPMALE:I hope this doesn't sound rude, but I've just gotten back from a long trip and I'm very tired.
LEADFEMALE:If you'll excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:Of course.
LEADMALE:Nice to have met you.
LEADFEMALE:Likewise.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, can I see you for a minute?
LEADMALE:Yes, Ma, what is it?
LEADMALE:That guy over there, is he a midget?
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Thank God.
OTHERMALE:I thought I was having another stroke.
SUPMALE:My goodness, I didn't realize it was getting so late.
SUPMALE:I really can't stay for coffee.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Ladies, I want to thank you for a wonderful evening.
OTHERMALE:Thank you for coming.
OTHERFEMALE:We certainly enjoyed having you.
LEADMALE:And we hope we'll see you again soon.
LEADFEMALE:And I'll see you tomorrow at the office, Jonathan.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, could we have dinner tomorrow after work? There's something important I want to talk to you about.
LEADMALE:OK, sure.
LEADMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Good night.
SUPMALE:Well, what do you think?
LEADMALE:He's quite a man! Oh, he certainly is, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm glad you both feel that way, because I think Jonathan's gonna ask me to marry him.
LEADMALE:Marry him? Honey, what makes you think he's going to ask you to marry him? I know he wants to get remarried.
LEADMALE:Our relationship is getting much more serious, and he just asked me to dinner to talk about something important.
LEADMALE:Believe me, he's gonna ask me to marry him.
SUPFEMALE:And how do you feel about that? I don't know.
SUPMALE:I like him a lot, but But you were embarrassed to have us meet him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:I hate myself for feeling like that, but it's true.
SUPFEMALE:When Jonathan and I are alone together, everything's wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:But, when we're around other people, I'm uncomfortable.
SUPMALE:I know they're staring at him and they're talking about us and it bothers me.
OTHERFEMALE:I know it shouldn't, but it does.
LEADMALE:I mean, how big a man is shouldn't make or break a relationship.
LEADMALE:Not a word, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, you're involved in a relationship that has very special problems and only you and Jonathan can decide whether those problems are worth working out.
LEADMALE:I can appreciate what you're going through, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:I once went through a very similar situation myself.
LEADMALE:You once dated a little person?
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:No, what I was referring to was a relationship I had in high school with a young man named Benjamin.
LEADMALE:You have to understand that in those days in the South, a lot of things were still taboo.
SUPMALE:Certain people were not to mix.
SUPFEMALE:So Benjamin and I had to meet in secret.
SUPMALE:We knew if any of the bigots in town found out about us, there'd be a terrible scandal.
LEADMALE:And then one day, I had to make a decision.
LEADFEMALE:Benjamin invited me to our senior prom.
SUPMALE:I didn't know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:Should I go out with this boy I really cared for, or should I bow to the pressures of an unjust society? So, what did you do? I walked into that gymnasium on Benjamin's arm.
SUPFEMALE:Heads turned, jaws dropped.
SUPMALE:Why, the room was buzzing all evening.
OTHERMALE:I didn't care.
SUPMALE:I had followed my heart.
LEADMALE:And I've never regretted it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, that's a beautiful story.
LEADMALE:That must have taken real courage for both of you! And it's terrible to think that the two of you were almost kept apart just because Benjamin was black.
LEADFEMALE:Black? Benjamin wasn't black.
LEADMALE:He was from New Jersey.
LEADMALE:I went to my senior prom with a Yankee! A Yankee, a Yankee? That is incredible! And to think they made a movie about that deadbeat Gandhi, when there's a story like this that hasn't been told.
LEADMALE:I don't know what I'm gonna do.
LEADMALE:I'm more confused than ever.
SUPMALE:Goodnight.
SUPMALE:Honey, is there anything at all we can do to help?
SUPFEMALE:No, I have to work this out for myself.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you sleep on it?
LEADMALE:I know you'll make the right decision.
SUPFEMALE:Goodnight, honey.
LEADFEMALE:A Yankee from New Jersey.
LEADMALE:You're a profile in courage, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Why don't you sleep on it, Rose? I know you'll make the right decision.
LEADFEMALE:The right decision the right decision (knock on door Come in.
LEADMALE:Let's go, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone's waiting for you! I don't think I can go through with this.
LEADMALE:What's the matter, honey? You and Jonathan have a fight? No, it's just that I think marrying Jonathan might be a mistake.
OTHERMALE:He is a lot shorter than I am.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? I hadn't noticed.
LEADMALE:Me neither.
LEADFEMALE:How could you miss it? Everyone notices.
SUPFEMALE:Wherever we go, people stare at him!
LEADFEMALE:Maybe they're staring at you, honey.
LEADFEMALE:At me? Only a good friend would tell you this, but that color you dye your hair? Honey, that hasn't existed since they discontinued the Ford Falcon.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's get this wedding on the road.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, why are you in a priest's outfit? Because I'm the one who's gonna marry you.
SUPFEMALE:But that doesn't make any sense!
LEADFEMALE:What the hell do you want from me? It's your dream.
LEADMALE:Come on, let's get you married!
LEADFEMALE:But I'm still not sure! Rose, you can't disappoint your guests! The guests? But I have to think of what's best for me! That's only in real life, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:In a dream, you do what's best for the guests.
OTHERMALE:All right, all right! Aah, there's my little girl!
SUPMALE:Daddy, I can't believe it's you!
LEADFEMALE:Daddy?
LEADFEMALE:You mean your dead daddy?
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:You see what lengths people went to to come to your wedding? I heard you were getting remarried and I wanted to meet the lucky guy! This is so strange! I always thought Daddy was much taller than that.
OTHERMALE:I don't remember him like that at all.
LEADFEMALE:That's probably because his size didn't matter to you.
SUPMALE:When you really care for someone, you see them for what they are on the inside! Nothing else matters.
LEADMALE:Oh, actually, girls, Rose is right.
OTHERMALE:I am much taller.
LEADMALE:I just appeared in the dream this way to make a point.
LEADMALE:Oh, Daddy, you always did know the right thing to do.
LEADMALE:Do you really think Jonathan and I will be happy together? Rose, all you can do is follow your heart.
LEADFEMALE:No one can predict the future.
OTHERMALE:Not necessarily true, Daddy Lindstrom.
LEADFEMALE:For Rose, you see, one of your wedding guests is none other than famed psychic Jeanne Dixon! Hello, Rose.
LEADMALE:Hello, Miss Dixon!
LEADMALE:Please, call me Jeanne.
LEADFEMALE:I know you want to.
LEADMALE:Wow! Jeanne, could you tell me what the future holds? Sure! In January, Brooke Shields and Lady Di will star together in a Broadway musical comedy.
LEADMALE:Senator Edward Kennedy will once again run for No, I mean what the future holds for me and Jonathan.
OTHERMALE:Rose, I'm not getting a clear picture on that.
SUPFEMALE:I do know that Jackie O will tie the knot again Thank you very much, Miss Dixon.
LEADMALE:Enjoy the wedding.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, what's the matter?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so confused, Jonathan.
LEADFEMALE:You see, I Do you mind? We'd like to talk in private! Why are we in the dream in the first place if she's throwing us out? Oh, Jonathan, I'm just not sure I can go through with this.
LEADMALE:I know this may not be the perfect relationship, but I care for you very, very much.
SUPFEMALE:If you feel the same way about me, we can lick any problem, big or small.
SUPMALE:Oh, I do care for you, Jonathan.
SUPMALE:Then will you marry me? Yes, yes, oh, yes.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, yes, yes
LEADFEMALE:Rose? Oh, Rose, honey.
LEADMALE:Wake up.
LEADMALE:Rosie, wake up darling.
LEADMALE:Rose!
LEADMALE:Wake up, wake up! Oh.
LEADMALE:I just had the weirdest dream about Jonathan.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, was it a bad dream?
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:It helped me make up my mind about our relationship.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna keep seeing him.
LEADMALE:If we actually care about each other, we can lick any problem, big or small.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? Oh, Rose has decided to keep on seeing Jonathan.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:We're all adults here.
LEADMALE:Let the man out of the pillowcase.
LEADMALE:We don't mind if he sleeps over.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:What did you think?
OTHERMALE:Oh, it was delicious.
LEADMALE:I love French food.
OTHERMALE:What was that you had?
LEADFEMALE:Trout.
OTHERFEMALE:What do they call it in French? Le trout.
LEADMALE:Oh, French is such a romantic language.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I love the food, I love the wine, and especially the company.
LEADFEMALE:I've put this off all evening, but there's something I want to talk to you about.
LEADMALE:What is it?
SUPMALE:I want to talk about us.
LEADMALE:Even though we've only been dating for a short period of time, I feel that our relationship is starting to get serious.
SUPFEMALE:I feel the same way.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to know I care for you a lot, but there's a problem we cannot continue to ignore.
LEADMALE:Rose, in order for a relationship to be complete, each person has to accept the other for what he is.
SUPMALE:I don't think that can ever happen between us.
LEADMALE:Jonathan, you're wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:I can accept you.
LEADFEMALE:I've had time to think this thing through and I can honestly say, it doesn't bother me that you're small.
SUPFEMALE:Small? No.
LEADFEMALE:I meant I can't see you anymore because you're not Jewish.
LEADFEMALE:What? Rose, this has been a very difficult decision for me.
LEADMALE:You're dumping me because I'm not Jewish? Oh, no, please understand, I come from a very religious family.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe this! I've been agonizing over this relationship and now you have the nerve to Rose, please lower your voice! People are staring at you.
SUPFEMALE:Staring at me? They're staring at you! Well, yes, but I'm used to it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a very snappy dresser! I'm sorry I did that.
LEADMALE:I guess I was upset.
OTHERFEMALE:I understand.
LEADMALE:I guess this has been a difficult relationship for both of us.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's been a wonderful relationship.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna miss you.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna miss you too, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:How was the shrimp? Unfortunately, I'll never know.
SUPMALE:You see, he's Jewish, and we can't see each other anymore.
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Who was known as the world's fastest human being?
OTHERMALE:Dominic Tansey.
LEADFEMALE:It says Jesse Owens here.
SUPMALE:Trust me, it was Dominic Tansey.
SUPFEMALE:He got four women pregnant in one night.
SUPMALE:Two in New York, two in New Jersey.
LEADMALE:Girls, I am so excited! I am finally going to do something you've heard me talk about doing for years! You decided to install a trapeze over your bed.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, I'm talking about this car.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, it's beautiful!
SUPFEMALE:Can you afford a car like this?
LEADMALE:Only if I can unload my old one.
LEADMALE:Oh, that won't be any problem.
LEADFEMALE:That's a wonderful car.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, you need a car.
SUPMALE:Why don't you buy it? No, no, I couldn't sell my car to Rose.
LEADFEMALE:She's my friend.
SUPFEMALE:My great granddaddy always used to say, there are two things you never sell to a friend
OTHERMALE:a car and a slave.
LEADFEMALE:'Cause if either one of them quits working, you'll never hear the end of it.
SUPMALE:" 'Course they hanged my great granddaddy.
LEADFEMALE:He said a lot of things he shouldn't have.
SUPMALE:What'll you give me for it?
LEADMALE:Oh, I couldn't buy your car.
SUPFEMALE:It's not my type.
LEADFEMALE:I want a car that says "practical.
OTHERFEMALE:" Your car says "available.
LEADMALE:" Well, just take off my personalized plates! Rose, I'll tell you what.
SUPFEMALE:Take the car for two weeks.
SUPFEMALE:Oh
LEADMALE:Just try it out.
LEADMALE:If you don't absolutely love it, I'll take it back.
LEADMALE:Well
OTHERFEMALE:No questions asked.
LEADMALE:What the heck, you only live once.
LEADMALE:Might as well be daring! Rose, it's a used car
LEADMALE:it's not a seat on the space shuttle.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, I need you to give me a manicure.
SUPMALE:Rose, I need you to lend me your pearls.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, I need you to stay off my back.
SUPMALE:What? What'd I do? I am going out with a new man tonight and he is not Italian.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, who is he, Dorothy?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, his name is Glen O'Brien.
LEADMALE:Where'd you meet him?
OTHERMALE:His name is O'Brien.
LEADMALE:Two to one, she met him at a gin mill.
LEADMALE:He's a teacher at the school where I've been subbing.
LEADFEMALE:A gorgeous gym teacher.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh I noticed him a few times and today, as luck would have it, I found myself right behind him in the line in the cafeteria.
OTHERFEMALE:After I butted ahead of 25 students.
LEADMALE:Anyway, we started talking and in 30 seconds, I was in love.
OTHERMALE:And he asked you out?
LEADMALE:Yes! We're going out to dinner tonight! I cannot believe how excited I am! I mean, he's practically a stranger, and I am crazy about him! I haven't felt this way about a man ever before.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, you've been hit by the thunderbolt! Love at first sight! It happened to me once.
SUPMALE:Once? You've been hit by more lightning than the World Trade Center!
LEADFEMALE:I was hit by the thunderbolt once.
SUPMALE:Probably a direct hit to the forehead.
LEADFEMALE:It was the first time I saw my Charlie.
OTHERMALE:I was seven and he was eight.
LEADFEMALE:It was a hot Minnesota summer and he had put up one of those little stands on the sidewalk.
LEADFEMALE:Selling lemonade.
SUPMALE:Insurance.
SUPMALE:And I bought a nickel policy on my red wagon.
LEADMALE:And right after that, my wagon was destroyed.
LEADFEMALE:How?
LEADMALE:Some hogs trampled it.
SUPFEMALE:I was hauling home a smoked ham for Mama and I think it set them off.
OTHERMALE:Anyway, that's when I fell in love with Charlie.
LEADMALE:He paid for a new wagon
LEADMALE:even though my policy didn't cover acts of swine.
SUPMALE:"Acts of swine.
SUPFEMALE:"
LEADFEMALE:It's amazing.
LEADMALE:What's amazing? Oh, I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:A lot of things.
LEADFEMALE:Like?
OTHERFEMALE:Like you.
LEADMALE:Hardly.
LEADFEMALE:Like me.
SUPFEMALE:Definitely.
SUPMALE:Like us.
SUPMALE:These past three weeks have been amazing.
LEADMALE:They have been pretty amazing.
SUPMALE:It's amazing that I just made love in the daylight.
OTHERMALE:Why is that amazing? Can't hide anything in the daytime.
LEADMALE:At night, I could be Godzilla, you'd be thrilled.
LEADMALE:I'm thrilled, period.
OTHERFEMALE:Everything about you thrills me.
LEADMALE:And that's amazing.
SUPMALE:You know, every time you tell me you love me, I turn around to see who you're talking to.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:Believe it.
LEADMALE:I love you.
SUPMALE:And everything that I used to worry about in you know I didn't worry about with you.
LEADMALE:Like? Like, like, how do I look, how do I sound is my breath bad what's jiggling.
SUPFEMALE:Well, let's see.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, and you.
SUPFEMALE:You are amazing.
LEADFEMALE:You are warm and loving and caring and smart and funny and I don't have to wear flats when I go out with you.
LEADMALE:I have an idea.
LEADFEMALE:Let's cut school tomorrow and go to the Bahamas and not leave our hotel room until the board of health threatens us.
OTHERMALE:I can't do it.
SUPMALE:Forget the Bahamas.
LEADFEMALE:How about dinner? Dorothy, listen.
LEADMALE:What?
SUPFEMALE:I have to tell you something.
LEADFEMALE:What? What, what, what?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, boy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, God.
OTHERMALE:I'm married.
SUPMALE:What? It's not a good marriage, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:It was over years ago.
LEADMALE:I can't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:You lied to me.
LEADMALE:No, I didn't lie.
LEADMALE:I'm telling you now.
LEADMALE:I'm getting out of here.
SUPFEMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:Let go of me.
LEADMALE:No, you got to listen.
SUPMALE:Please, you have to listen!
SUPFEMALE:Listen to what, listen to what? How your wife doesn't understand you? How you stayed because of the children? I did stay for the children.
LEADFEMALE:My wife would have moved them back to her home.
LEADFEMALE:My kids would have been clear across the country.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't bear to lose them, so I stayed.
LEADFEMALE:Your children are over 30.
LEADMALE:You're still staying for them? I couldn't leave her because of all the things Look, I don't want to hear about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my God, I'm storming out to the bathroom.
LEADMALE:Will you look at what we have? We make each other happy.
OTHERFEMALE:You lied to me.
SUPMALE:I couldn't lie to you, that's why I told you.
LEADMALE:Don't end this, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:You mean everything to me.
SUPFEMALE:It's over with my wife.
SUPMALE:It's just hard to walk out, is all.
LEADFEMALE:Well, not for me it isn't.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, girls.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, you remember a few days ago when I said your car was making a funny kind of a noise sometimes?
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:It's making it all the time now.
LEADMALE:It's nothing serious, I'm sure.
SUPFEMALE:It started making a wheezing, coughing, rattling kind of a sound
OTHERMALE:every time it goes up a hill.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's a bad sign.
SUPMALE:Those are the sounds Tony Triano made the night they wheeled him out of the home on a gurney.
LEADFEMALE:That car's in terrific condition.
LEADMALE:Sometimes it's a little hard to turn over in the morning.
SUPFEMALE:Tony Triano to a T.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I should have a mechanic check it out.
SUPMALE:Oh, Rose, wake up and smell the coffee.
SUPFEMALE:An auto mechanic is the last person to take a car to.
OTHERMALE:They only make money if they tell you there's something wrong with it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's a good point.
SUPMALE:Boy, I wish I had a car to sell.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? It's for Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:I think it's Glen.
LEADFEMALE:That's the fourth time he's called today.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you know what we're supposed to tell him.
OTHERFEMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? Dorothy's not home and she's never coming home again.
LEADFEMALE:Now, don't call here anymore.
LEADMALE:This is Rose, who's this? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Yamamoto from the school district?
LEADMALE:Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you were the man Dorothy's having the affair with.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, the man Dorothy said is always so fair with her.
LEADMALE:Of course, I would expect you to be fair.
LEADMALE:And polite.
LEADFEMALE:And good at math.
LEADMALE:I'm so glad you got your own Disneyland.
LEADMALE:Oh, ah, thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Goodbye.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, Dorothy? Mr.
SUPMALE:Yamamoto just called about a teaching job.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm not ready to go back to work yet.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you depressed about Glen? No, I'm depressed because Phyllis George left the morning news.
LEADFEMALE:Of course I'm depressed about Glen.
LEADMALE:For three weeks he made me the happiest woman in the world.
LEADMALE:This past week without him has just been miserable.
SUPMALE:At least you have the comfort of knowing you did the right thing.
SUPMALE:Then why do I feel so rotten? Dorothy, he's married.
LEADFEMALE:You have to forget him!
SUPMALE:I can't just forget him!
LEADMALE:Rose, come on.
LEADFEMALE:None of us is a schoolgirl anymore.
LEADMALE:Although, quite frankly, I am sometimes mistaken for one.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please, Blanche.
LEADMALE:As long as Glen and Dorothy are realistic and discreet about their situation,
LEADMALE:who are they really hurting?
LEADMALE:No one.
LEADMALE:That's who.
SUPMALE:Blanche, are you condoning their behavior? No, I'm just not passing judgment.
OTHERMALE:Sometimes life doesn't work out the way we'd like it to.
SUPMALE:Sometimes we have to just grab our happiness where we can get it.
LEADFEMALE:That's the same attitude that broke up Debbie and Eddie Eddie and Liz.
LEADFEMALE:Liz and Dick.
OTHERMALE:Martin and Lewis.
OTHERFEMALE:Rowan and Martin.
LEADMALE:Shut up.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? Oh, hello Glen.
SUPFEMALE:Hang up on that bed-hopper.
SUPMALE:Don't hang up on him.
LEADFEMALE:That man cares for you.
SUPMALE:Hop, hop.
SUPMALE:Go with your feelings.
SUPFEMALE:Glen, I thought I told you I don't want to talk to you.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
SUPFEMALE:If he wants to talk or hop, let him do it with his wife.
LEADMALE:Don't deny your passion.
LEADMALE:It's unnatural.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Glen, you are making this very difficult for me! No, I will not change my mind.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye, Glen.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, I'm proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:You'll see, it's not the end of the world.
LEADFEMALE:No, just feels like it.
LEADMALE:Oh, I hope I'm doing the right thing.
LEADFEMALE:You are if you really meant it when you said you never want to see him again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Let's start supper.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be with you in a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Glen? Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I miss you.
LEADMALE:I think we have to talk.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, yes, Mr.
LEADMALE:Yamamoto, yes.
SUPFEMALE:Fine, I'll see you there.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm so glad you're going back to work.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, he was thrilled, too.
SUPMALE:Dorothy?
LEADFEMALE:What is this, the Spanish Inquisition? Look, I don't have to defend myself.
LEADFEMALE:If I want to see Glen, I'll see Glen.
LEADMALE:You're seeing Glen? I don't want to hear about it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't want to talk about it.
LEADMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing up so late?
LEADMALE:I was hungry.
OTHERFEMALE:I was making myself a sandwich.
LEADMALE:Do you want one?
LEADFEMALE:No, thanks, we went out to dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's nice.
LEADFEMALE:So you spent the evening at dinner.
LEADFEMALE:No, we spent dinner at dinner.
LEADFEMALE:We spent the evening at a motel.
SUPFEMALE:A motel? Dorothy! A cheap, tawdry, bare-bulb den of iniquity? We didn't drive to Sodom and Gomorrah, Rose.
SUPMALE:It was a very pleasant place over on Biscayne Bay.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to hear about it!
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to talk about it.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
OTHERMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I'll have something.
LEADFEMALE:I was too nervous to eat much at dinner.
LEADMALE:But I suppose the rest of the evening really built up an appetite.
SUPMALE:Oh, hi! I didn't expect to see you girls up so late.
OTHERMALE:I'm just having a snack.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy's the one having an affair at a motel.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Rose.
SUPMALE:I just want to keep the record straight.
SUPMALE:Besides, Blanche has had experience in that area.
LEADMALE:Maybe she can give you some advice.
OTHERFEMALE:I certainly can.
LEADMALE:In the first place, never check in as Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:and Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Smith.
SUPMALE:Always check in as Mr.
LEADMALE:and Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Don Shula.
LEADFEMALE:What? That way, you always get a complimentary fruit basket and a bottle of champagne.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Dorothy's seeing Glen again.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:And I don't need any advice.
SUPMALE:I can handle it.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I had a third cousin who ran around with a married man
LEADMALE:for 15 years.
SUPMALE:Are they still together? Well, they would be, but his wife shot him in the boxer shorts.
SUPMALE:And after that, he just kind of lost interest.
OTHERMALE:Iost interest.
OTHERFEMALE:Evil is as evil does.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, will you stop being so judgmental! This is a situation you know nothing about! At least Blanche has been there and she knows what I'm going through.
SUPFEMALE:Well, not exactly.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, I've never been with a married man.
LEADFEMALE:Get out of here! No, it's true! I just never figured a relationship with a married man was worthwhile.
LEADFEMALE:Good for you, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm no fool.
SUPFEMALE:The husband's always so guilty, he ends up giving the really expensive gifts to the wife! Look, I didn't choose for things to happen this way.
OTHERMALE:I tried to do the right thing, but the right thing was not right for me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in love.
OTHERMALE:And if there are sacrifices that have to be made, I can accept them.
LEADMALE:I'm happy and that's what matters.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:So, you started up with your married man again.
LEADFEMALE:How did you know?
SUPMALE:I'm the Amazing Kreskin.
SUPMALE:I was listening outside the door.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Ma.
SUPMALE:Oh, I can't put my ear to the door, but you can put your Ma! I raised you to have respect for yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Not be somebody's floozy.
LEADFEMALE:Purple rain Sophia, Sophia, where's Blanche? I have to talk to her about her car! Purple rain
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Rose.
LEADMALE:Blanche, about your car.
LEADMALE:I went to the bank to get the money.
SUPFEMALE:I can't sell you that car.
LEADMALE:But, Blanche
LEADFEMALE:Honey, I can't sleep from all the worry and guilt I have been suffering.
LEADMALE:I wasn't totally honest with you.
OTHERFEMALE:I told you that car was in perfect condition.
SUPMALE:Well, it's not.
SUPMALE:It's a piece of junk.
OTHERFEMALE:It's the noisiest thing to come out of Detroit since Martha and the Vandellas.
LEADFEMALE:When I went to trade it in, they only offered me half the blue book price.
LEADMALE:I need the whole amount to put down on my new car, so that's why I tried to sell it to you.
LEADMALE:But I can't go through with it! I cannot sell you that car! You can't sell it to anyone.
LEADMALE:Somebody stole it.
LEADFEMALE:What?
LEADMALE:Somebody stole Blanche's Very nice, Rose! I lend you a perfectly fine automobile, no strings attached, and you let some thief drive off in it! Rose Nylund, I will never forgive you! Wasn't it insured? They'll pay you full blue book.
LEADFEMALE:All is forgiven! I'm gonna go call the car dealer right now and tell him he made a sale.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, was the gist of what you were saying before
OTHERFEMALE:that you intended to cheat me?
SUPMALE:Cheat you? Rose, you just analyze everything to death! Ma, where are my shoes? Another date with Mrs.
OTHERMALE:O'Brien's husband? Now look, don't you start with me.
LEADMALE:I will continue to see Glen for as long as I please! Is he gonna leave his wife? Ma, Ma, for the first time in a long time, I am really happy.
LEADFEMALE:So please, leave me alone! If you're so happy, how come I hear you pacing in your room night after night? I can't sleep.
LEADFEMALE:I have a lot on my mind.
SUPFEMALE:I'll tell you what's on your mind.
OTHERFEMALE:You hate yourself.
LEADFEMALE:I do not.
SUPFEMALE:My mistake.
LEADFEMALE:I've only known you since the day you were born.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I've heard enough, Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm leaving now to meet Glen
LEADFEMALE:and have a perfectly marvelous time.
LEADMALE:I hope he's taking you bowling.
SUPMALE:Bowling?
LEADMALE:Yeah, you could rent shoes there.
LEADFEMALE:If you want to grab some dinner, we'll have to take separate cars.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna have to leave for home right from the restaurant.
SUPFEMALE:Glen, forget dinner.
SUPFEMALE:We need to talk.
LEADFEMALE:Things aren't working out anymore and I don't know what to do to make them any better.
SUPFEMALE:You can't leave your wife and I'm not cut out to be the other woman.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, you know I love you.
OTHERMALE:I know that.
OTHERMALE:But it's not enough.
LEADMALE:I don't want to lose you.
LEADMALE:I don't want to lose you either.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I came back.
OTHERMALE:I thought you understood.
LEADFEMALE:I can't break up my marriage! Not now, not at this stage of my life.
LEADFEMALE:If things didn't work out between you and me, I'd be alone.
LEADFEMALE:That kind of risk is fine when you're 40, but I couldn't do it today.
LEADFEMALE:I'm too old for that, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Glen, the risk shouldn't scare you at any age.
LEADFEMALE:And at any age, the loving would make it worthwhile.
SUPMALE:You want a safe, easy, comfortable home life and a romance and excitement on the side and it's not for me.
LEADMALE:Please think about what you're throwing away.
SUPFEMALE:If I stay, I am throwing away my future.
LEADMALE:Now I'll go home.
LEADFEMALE:I'll hurt.
LEADFEMALE:But after awhile, I'll feel better and I'll go on with my life.
LEADMALE:If I continue this, I'll end up alone.
LEADFEMALE:And I care too much about myself to let that happen.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I love you.
LEADFEMALE:I love you too.
LEADMALE:Goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Ma.
LEADMALE:You're home early.
SUPMALE:I broke up with Glen.
SUPFEMALE:I told him I couldn't see him anymore.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you'd be happy.
LEADMALE:You want me to be happy? Help me put away the dishes.
OTHERMALE:You still angry with me?
LEADFEMALE:I was never really angry.
LEADFEMALE:I was worried.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like seeing you in pain.
SUPFEMALE:Still angry with me?
LEADMALE:What for? For trying to stop your daughter from making a mistake? Somebody has to.
OTHERMALE:You kids get to be middle-aged, you think you know everything! I don't care what you say, you were speeding! I tell you, that is not why that highway patrolman was following us!  Oh, Blanche, please.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy? Oh, I thought you were out.
OTHERFEMALE:No, we ended the evening early.
SUPFEMALE:You and Glen have a disagreement?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, he thinks he should stay married.
LEADMALE:You mean it's over? Look, we just came back to pick Sophia up.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche got her new car! Yeah, and we're gonna all pile in and go cruising.
LEADFEMALE:Do you want to go with us?
SUPMALE:No, I think I'll just stay home tonight.
SUPMALE:I feel, you know, just like sitting.
LEADFEMALE:Me too.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'll have a cup of tea.
SUPMALE:It's kind of late.
LEADMALE:I'm a little tired.
SUPMALE:I think I'll just stick around.
LEADMALE:Oh, what the heck.
LEADMALE:That car will still be there tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, this is depressing! Girls, let's go cruising.
SUPFEMALE:I know a place where guys wrestle naked in the mud! 
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Well here we are.
LEADFEMALE:Rose please.
SUPMALE:I can't, Al.
OTHERMALE:We've been seeing each other for a month, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I've never wanted anyone so much.
LEADFEMALE:What about your place? My sister's there.
SUPFEMALE:She's an insomniac.
SUPMALE:We'd have an audience.
LEADMALE:I can't let you stay here.
SUPMALE:I just can't.
LEADMALE:I simply can't take you to a hotel.
OTHERMALE:It just cheapens it.
LEADMALE:I guess we're doomed.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's talk inside.
OTHERFEMALE:The thing is, I've never done this before
LEADMALE:bring someone home.
OTHERFEMALE:I understand.
SUPMALE:Are you quiet? I'm whispering.
LEADMALE:I don't mean now.
LEADMALE:I mean then.
LEADMALE:Oh, very quiet.
SUPFEMALE:I'm very quiet.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't scream.
SUPMALE:I don't shout.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a very quiet person.
LEADMALE:I even wear quiet clothes
LEADMALE:all solids.
LEADMALE:I'm quiet, too.
LEADMALE:Then we'll be fine! I just don't want the others to know you're here.
LEADMALE:They'll never know.
LEADFEMALE:In the morning, we're getting up early to play golf.
SUPFEMALE:You can leave while they're gone.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
OTHERMALE:They won't know?
LEADFEMALE:Never.
OTHERFEMALE:OK but quiet.
LEADMALE:Like a mouse.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, boy.
SUPMALE:That must have been some dream you were having last night.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about?
LEADMALE:I never heard such a racket.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you were making love.
LEADMALE:No, no, I wasn't.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:It was a nightmare
OTHERMALE:an awful nightmare, just terrible.
LEADMALE:Isn't it interesting how the sounds are the same for awful nightmares and great sex? Really? I wouldn't know.
SUPMALE:Oh, Dorothy, come on.
OTHERMALE:Shouldn't we get going, girls? You don't make noise?
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:How can you not? Well, I guess I always felt it wasn't very ladylike.
LEADMALE:We should go, girls.
SUPFEMALE:Hold your bladder, Rose.
LEADMALE:Not a sound?
LEADMALE:Well, it never seemed to warrant one.
SUPMALE:Well, do you talk?
LEADMALE:I've always wanted to, but at that point, it seems that nobody is ever interested in conversation.
LEADFEMALE:Not conversation! I mean dirty talk.
LEADMALE:Dirty talk?
LEADFEMALE:Well, not filth, for God's sake.
OTHERFEMALE:Dirty talk?
LEADFEMALE:Morning, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Morning.
LEADMALE:Dirty talk?
LEADMALE:Later.
LEADMALE:There's a man in your bed.
LEADMALE:Oh, Sophia, there's not.
LEADFEMALE:Why, you devil, you.
SUPMALE:So that was what we heard, Rose!
SUPMALE:Rose got lucky.
SUPMALE:Not so lucky.
SUPFEMALE:The man in your bed is dead.
SUPMALE:What?
LEADMALE:Dead.
LEADMALE:Oh, Sophia.
LEADMALE:He's not dead.
LEADMALE:I was just in there.
LEADMALE:So was I.
LEADFEMALE:I went to put back your laundry.
OTHERMALE:I see there's a man in the bed, so I introduce myself, but he doesn't answer.
LEADMALE:He's dead.
SUPFEMALE:He-He's shy.
SUPFEMALE:He's very shy.
LEADMALE:Didn't sound so shy last night.
LEADFEMALE:OK, fine, let a dead guy lie there.
SUPMALE:It's gonna be 98 degrees today.
SUPMALE:It won't be pretty.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sure he's not dead.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, go look.
OTHERMALE:Come on, he's sleeping.
LEADMALE:I don't want to wake him.
LEADFEMALE:You could light firecrackers in his nostrils.
LEADFEMALE:You won't wake him.
LEADFEMALE:All right, now, Rose, go on.
OTHERMALE:I don't want dead people in my house.
SUPFEMALE:People? We are talking about one man, who is probably sleeping.
SUPMALE:You don't think I can recognize death? I lived in a retirement home.
OTHERMALE:Death visited more often than children.
LEADMALE:Rose, go on.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I can't.
LEADMALE:Why?
LEADMALE:I'm afraid.
SUPMALE:You go.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:I can't go in there.
LEADMALE:I have a thing against dead people.
OTHERMALE:I've never seen one.
LEADMALE:I never intend to.
SUPMALE:Didn't you see your husband when he was dead? Oh, no.
SUPMALE:I cannot look at dead people.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I don't even watch the news.
LEADMALE:Every now and then they stick a corpse in on you.
SUPFEMALE:You could be watching a perfectly lovely story about Central America, all of a sudden, bam, a dead body.
LEADFEMALE:This is ridiculous! I mean, here we sit, calmly eating our bran flakes, when there could be a dead man in the house.
SUPMALE:I'll go.
LEADMALE:She's very brave.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, I'll say.
LEADMALE:I want someone to come with me.
SUPMALE:I'll go, I'll go.
SUPFEMALE:I'm from Sicily.
SUPFEMALE:What's the big deal? He's not dead but he'll wish he was when those two barge in on him.
LEADMALE:Who is he?
SUPMALE:His name is Al.
OTHERFEMALE:No, I mean, what's he do?
LEADFEMALE:He imports diamonds.
SUPMALE:Oh, damn, I hope he's not dead.
SUPMALE:He bought the farm.
OTHERFEMALE:What farm? Rose, he's dead.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:The poor man.
LEADMALE:And with a new farm and everything.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:When did he die?
LEADMALE:I wasn't there, Rose.
LEADMALE:You were.
LEADMALE:You mean, I slept with a dead man last night? Honey, I sleep with them all the time.
LEADFEMALE:He was so quiet.
LEADFEMALE:I just thought he was a sound sleeper.
SUPMALE:What'll we do?
SUPFEMALE:Well, we call the police.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't murder him! Of course you didn't murder him, honey.
LEADMALE:He probably had a heart attack.
LEADMALE:Now, look.
LEADFEMALE:His family has to be notified.
LEADMALE:Now, did he ever speak of any family? He had a sister he lives with.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, what's her name?
SUPFEMALE:His name was Al Beatty.
LEADMALE:Her name was Beatty, too.
OTHERFEMALE:She never married.
OTHERFEMALE:I suppose I have to tell her.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes, you do.
LEADFEMALE:You cannot let the police tell her.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, the night George died, my telephone rang and a highway patrolman said, "Pardon me, ma'am.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have a yellow convertible and a husband named George?" I said, "Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Good grief, what's happened?" And he said, "Hold on, ma'am.
SUPMALE:" He put me on hold, with that music while you wait.
LEADFEMALE:I sat there at two in the morning, listening to Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass.
LEADFEMALE:And then after an eternity, he comes back on the line, eating chips.
LEADFEMALE:He says, "Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am, but I'm the only one here.
SUPFEMALE:My phone's been ringing off the hook.
OTHERFEMALE:" I said, "Officer, what about my husband?" And then he said, crunching his chips, "Oh, he's dead.
OTHERFEMALE:Wrong way driver hit him head-on.
SUPFEMALE:Totally dead, ma'am.
OTHERFEMALE:" Crunch, crunch.
LEADMALE:Oh, no! Puts me on hold, and then eats Doritos while he tells me my life is over.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose has to tell her.
SUPFEMALE:Rose won't eat chips.
LEADMALE:I never eat chips.
LEADMALE:I don't like them.
LEADFEMALE:They fall in my bra.
SUPMALE:Well, honey, you've got to do it.
OTHERFEMALE:His sister lives in Boca Raton.
LEADMALE:I'll look it up.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:I can't sleep in a bed that's had a dead person in it.
SUPMALE:I just can't!
SUPMALE:You'll get a new bed.
LEADFEMALE:And sheets.
LEADFEMALE:And sheets.
LEADMALE:And a blanket.
LEADMALE:Burn down the house.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, poor Al, and he just got a hair transplant.
LEADFEMALE:Here's a Beatty in Boca Raton.
LEADFEMALE:It's the only one.
LEADMALE:And somebody told me he just bought a farm.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:What'll I say to her?
LEADFEMALE:That he died in the bed of an idiot.
LEADFEMALE:Ma!
OTHERMALE:You tell the truth.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I can't tell her the truth.
LEADFEMALE:I can't tell her where he died.
LEADMALE:He died visiting.
LEADMALE:That's what you tell her.
SUPMALE:Visiting.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Visiting
SUPMALE:that's good.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I just can't believe he's dead.
LEADMALE:I don't think she's home.
LEADMALE:It rang once! Hello? Is this Miss Beatty? I beg your pardon? Well, do you have a brother, Al? I see.
LEADMALE:Well, I must have the wrong number.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Wrong number?
LEADFEMALE:Right number, wrong person.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean? That wasn't his sister.
LEADMALE:That was his wife.
LEADMALE:He was married.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe it.
OTHERMALE:There's a married dead man in my bed!
OTHERMALE:Serves him right.
SUPFEMALE:Ma!
LEADMALE:He lied to her.
SUPMALE:I don't know why they do that.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't they know we'll sleep with them anyway? What am I gonna do? I can't tell her her husband died in my bed.
SUPFEMALE:Tell her you went to turn on the sprinklers and you found him on the lawn.
OTHERMALE:That's not bad.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I've never had to do this before
LEADMALE:tell a wife that her husband's been cheating on her with me.
LEADMALE:That's the hardest thing to tell anybody.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, it's not.
LEADMALE:How about having to tell a pregnant woman that her husband's been cheating on her with her own sister and you're the sister and you're pregnant, too by her husband.
LEADMALE:You didn't! Not me last night on Dallas.
LEADFEMALE:Or Dynasty.
LEADMALE:or Falcon's Landing.
OTHERMALE:or one of those.
SUPFEMALE:They're all the same.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I thought you were the one.
SUPMALE:Oh, please.
LEADMALE:I could never do anything like that.
OTHERMALE:If you saw my brother-in-law, you'd know why.
SUPMALE:Look, Rose.
OTHERMALE:You're gonna have to go tell her.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, she's probably worried sick already.
LEADMALE:I've never done anything like this.
LEADMALE:Tell a woman her husband's been seeing me? Mm-hmm, and she'll say, "Why, that dirty rat.
OTHERMALE:I will kill him.
SUPMALE:" And you say, "Good news, darling.
SUPFEMALE:You don't have to.
SUPMALE:He's dead.
LEADFEMALE:" (doorbell Hello, I'm Rose Nylund.
LEADMALE:I'll save you some time.
SUPMALE:I don't wear Avon, I have a mop, and I'm still paying for an encyclopedia that my son used just once to look up Sexual Genitalia, Female.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Beatty, it's not that.
LEADMALE:It's about your husband.
LEADFEMALE:He dumped you.
SUPMALE:You've been dating him and he dumped you, and now you're getting even by telling me.
SUPMALE:No, that's not
LEADFEMALE:I've heard this before,
LEADFEMALE:I can't tell you how many times.
LEADMALE:You have? You think you're the first? Please.
SUPFEMALE:The first time Al slept with someone else was on our honeymoon.
LEADMALE:No!
LEADFEMALE:In Paris
SUPMALE:the chambermaid.
SUPMALE:He always had the sign on the door, "Maid Service Requested.
OTHERMALE:" He slept with everyone
OTHERFEMALE:secretaries, schoolteachers, babysitters, neighbors, friends.
LEADFEMALE:One Easter, we gave our little boy some rabbits.
LEADMALE:They used to look at Al in amazement.
OTHERMALE:How long had you been seeing him? About a month but that's not why I'm here.
SUPFEMALE:I have bad news.
LEADMALE:Well, you couldn't be pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:Last night, Al had a heart attack and died.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Beatty, I'm so very, very sorry.
LEADMALE:Well, you must have the wrong Al.
SUPMALE:You've been sleeping with someone else's Al.
OTHERMALE:My Al is as healthy as a horse.
LEADFEMALE:It can't be him!
LEADMALE:Al Beatty, from Boca Raton?
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
OTHERMALE:You're telling me Al is dead?
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:A heart attack is crazy.
LEADMALE:He was a runner.
LEADMALE:He couldn't have a heart attack.
LEADFEMALE:I'm talking, so it can't be true.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I mean? If I keep talking, it isn't true.
LEADFEMALE:All I have to do is talk forever.
LEADMALE:Oh, God, Al! I'm all right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm OK.
LEADFEMALE:Al the big jerk.
LEADMALE:I loved him.
LEADFEMALE:He was a decent man, you know? I know.
LEADMALE:He was.
SUPFEMALE:Caring.
LEADMALE:Very.
SUPFEMALE:Special.
LEADMALE:And it's all my fault! He had a heart attack.
SUPMALE:It's not your fault.
SUPFEMALE:He had a heart attack with me.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Beatty, my late husband had a heart attack with me as well.
LEADFEMALE:They drop like flies around me! Mrs.
SUPMALE:Nylund, you're not responsible for the death of my husband.
LEADMALE:I'll never date again.
SUPMALE:You will.
OTHERMALE:I won't.
SUPMALE:I can't.
LEADFEMALE:In time, you'll forget this.
OTHERFEMALE:Never.
LEADFEMALE:I promise you.
LEADMALE:It's OK.
SUPMALE:I'll get used to being alone.
SUPFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Nylund.
OTHERMALE:Yes? You've been sleeping with my husband and he's just died.
LEADMALE:See if you can pull yourself together, because in a minute, I'm going to need some comforting myself.
LEADMALE:All right, try this dressing and tell me what you think.
SUPMALE:It's called Creamy Zesty Italian, only has one calorie.
LEADMALE:Mmm.
LEADMALE:If you ran it under the faucet, it would have more flavor.
SUPFEMALE:Shoot.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, beware of anyone who says, "no calories," "absolutely no charge," and, "let's just lie down on the bed and watch television.
SUPFEMALE:"
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Did you do it?
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:And? I'm gonna become a nun.
LEADMALE:I'm the kiss of death.
LEADFEMALE:It's the second time a man has died in my bed.
LEADFEMALE:The second time?
LEADMALE:Dorothy knows.
LEADFEMALE:Charlie.
SUPMALE:No!
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:What exactly do you do in bed, Rose? Nothing.
SUPMALE:I do nothing.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe that's it.
LEADFEMALE:They have to do it all.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not her fault.
LEADFEMALE:She has a perfectly normal sex life.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, I knew somebody who had seven husbands and six of them died of stomach ailments.
LEADFEMALE:Well, they arrested her.
OTHERFEMALE:She'd been putting ground glass in their salads.
OTHERMALE:Why?
LEADFEMALE:Because she ran out of croutons! Because she wanted to kill them, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:We had a neighbor in Minnesota who killed her husband.
SUPMALE:She backed over him with a combine and she didn't even know she had done it until she found little bits of plaid in the corn.
LEADFEMALE:She said, "Funny, that looks like bits of Joe's plaid shirt "and that looks like bits of Joe's overalls "and that looks like bits of Joe's arms and that looks like bits of"
SUPMALE:Rose! We get the picture!
LEADFEMALE:They had a very little coffin
SUPMALE:Ah! Listen, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:You are not to blame.
SUPMALE:Now, you know that.
LEADFEMALE:Of course I know that.
OTHERMALE:She was driving the combine.
SUPMALE:I wasn't anywhere near their farm.
LEADMALE:Come on, Rose, it'll be fun.
OTHERMALE:You like square dancing.
OTHERMALE:No, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:You're only gonna be dancing with men.
SUPFEMALE:You can't kill them by doing that.
LEADFEMALE:Nope.
LEADFEMALE:No more men.
LEADMALE:That's it for me.
OTHERMALE:No more men? My God, I would die.
LEADFEMALE:I would just die.
LEADMALE:It's not like no more food, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:It's worse! There are many women who live happy lives without men.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, who?
OTHERFEMALE:Well, Inga Lundqvist.
OTHERFEMALE:Who was she, some Swedish lesbian? She was a neighbor of ours.
LEADMALE:Not, by chance, the one who shredded her husband with some farm machinery? Yes, and she never remarried.
LEADFEMALE:And she led a very happy rest of her life baking, sewing, gardening, tending the animals.
OTHERMALE:Ooh, my favorite things.
SUPMALE:OK, let's get this show on the road.
SUPMALE:Rose, you sure you don't want to come and just watch? Come on, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:You'll sit and watch my dentures eat corn on the cob.
LEADFEMALE:It's a lot of laughs.
LEADFEMALE:No, I don't want to kill anyone else.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, you sure you're gonna be all right here alone? She'll be fine.
SUPMALE:If someone breaks in, she'll just have to sleep with them.
SUPFEMALE:(doorbell
OTHERMALE:Who is it?
OTHERMALE:Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Beatty.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Beatty, come in.
SUPFEMALE:I just had to come by.
SUPFEMALE:You were so caring to come tell me in person what happened
LEADMALE:that I had to do something for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that wasn't necessary.
LEADMALE:Well, I know you blame yourself for Al's death.
LEADMALE:Well, I just got the autopsy results, and they showed that Al's arteries were completely clogged.
SUPMALE:Oh, his diet was terrible.
LEADMALE:He never ate a vegetable.
LEADMALE:He lived on fatty foods.
SUPMALE:He'd have meat for dessert.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't kill him, Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Nylund.
SUPMALE:He killed himself.
OTHERMALE:He committed suicide? In a manner of speaking.
SUPFEMALE:He'd have died whether he'd been here or not.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so glad not that he's dead.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I just had to tell you you had nothing to do with it.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:And if he had to die, I'm glad he didn't die alone on the street, but here, with a caring person, doing what he liked to do best.
LEADMALE:Ma!
SUPFEMALE:What? Will you stop telling her what to play? I'm not saying a word.
LEADFEMALE:Did I speak, Blanche?
OTHERMALE:Not a word.
LEADFEMALE:You keep shaking your head.
SUPFEMALE:I've been holding it up for 80 years.
LEADMALE:You'd shake, too.
LEADMALE:Well, what do you think?
LEADFEMALE:Of what, honey?
SUPMALE:My new dress.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, is that new?
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:It's sort of old-fashioned looking.
OTHERMALE:I wasn't sure it was new.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's the style.
LEADMALE:The girl told me.
LEADFEMALE:What was she, a pilgrim? Come on, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:You look wonderful, Rose.
LEADMALE:Absolutely lovely.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I suppose I should go.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't had a date in three months, but I just don't know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:I adore Arnie.
LEADMALE:He's the sweetest man in the world, and very special to me.
SUPFEMALE:And it'll be hard no to, you know, because I like him so much, and since we're going away for the weekend, and since we already have, if I don't, then he'll think I don't like him anymore, and I do.
SUPMALE:So maybe I will, but I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:I might not.
SUPMALE:Rose! Rose, honey, you know you are not responsible for Al's death, so why don't you just go on, have a good time,
LEADMALE:and whatever happens, happens.
SUPMALE:I know Al had bad arteries, but still, I can't be totally sure.
LEADMALE:Come on, now, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:You do what makes you comfortable and don't worry about anything else.
LEADFEMALE:OK.
SUPFEMALE:Well I'm off.
SUPFEMALE:Totally! I wonder where she is.
LEADMALE:She's almost two hours late.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, they probably hit traffic.
SUPFEMALE:I bet she slept with him.
SUPFEMALE:I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't.
LEADMALE:Well, I sure couldn't be with a man I liked and abstain.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I abstained after Stan and I split up but it wasn't a very different experience from when Stan and I were together.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, here she is.
LEADFEMALE:Well? Well, what happened?
SUPMALE:What?
LEADFEMALE:How was it? You had a terrible time?
LEADFEMALE:You had a wonderful time?
SUPMALE:Honey, tell us what happened! Arnie I slept with him.
LEADMALE:And?
LEADFEMALE:He died.
LEADMALE:What?
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:And the sheriff
LEADFEMALE:I told him about me, how I kill men and he didn't believe me! He said, "Let's see.
OTHERFEMALE:Sleep with me.
SUPFEMALE:" So I did and the sheriff died.
SUPFEMALE:Arnie's fine! We had a wonderful time.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's terrific.
LEADMALE:I was only joking!
LEADMALE:You what?
LEADMALE:It was a joke!
SUPFEMALE:A joke.
LEADFEMALE:That's a terrible joke!
OTHERMALE:Awful!
LEADFEMALE:You can't joke about a thing like that!
SUPMALE:My God, Rose!
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I believed her.
SUPMALE:I was set to go to her hanging.
LEADFEMALE:Some joke! I thought it was funny.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Morning.
SUPMALE:Oh, here, taste this.
LEADMALE:What is it?
LEADMALE:Oh, it's my special maple syrup, honey, brown sugar, molasses, Rice Krispies log.
LEADMALE:How practical.
LEADMALE:A snack you can panel your den with.
LEADMALE:Some people put flour in it, but I think that makes it too heavy.
SUPFEMALE:My kids always liked it this way.
SUPFEMALE:Tell me, Rose, do any of your kids still have their own teeth? I know it's a little sweet, but it's Kirstin's favorite.
LEADFEMALE:What are you and your daughter planning on doing this week? My granddaughter's never been to Florida before, so I thought I'd take them to SeaWorld and Gatorworld and Reptile World
OTHERFEMALE:and Parrot Village.
LEADFEMALE:What? The parrots don't get a world? This is outrageous.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, just look at this man.
LEADMALE:He is obviously guilty as sin.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even know why they bother with a trial.
OTHERMALE:What trial?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, the Duncan Osgood trial.
OTHERFEMALE:That big society murder over in Palm Beach? What makes you so sure he's guilty? His wife was found at the bottom of their private lake clutching his dickey in her hand.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that would certainly place him at the scene of the crime.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at this.
SUPMALE:I'm a walking time bomb.
LEADFEMALE:Stand back, I could blow any minute.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you know that machine is not working.
LEADFEMALE:We shouldn't take any chances.
LEADMALE:I can't be moved.
LEADMALE:Somebody else will have to give up their room for Rose's family.
LEADMALE:You're fine.
LEADFEMALE:You're staying with me.
LEADMALE:You always complain and we always get through it.
LEADMALE:All right, fine.
LEADFEMALE:But I'm begging you, while we're sleeping together, please lay off the broccoli at dinner, huh? Sophia, I really appreciate you giving up your room.
LEADFEMALE:It's just so much more fun having the family here than at a hotel.
OTHERMALE:I bet you're pretty excited about their visit.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes
LEADMALE:and a little nervous.
SUPMALE:Nervous? Why would you be nervous at your daughter and your granddaughter? My friend Maria is always nervous when her daughter Theresa comes for a visit.
SUPMALE:Of course her daughter is a hitman for the Mob.
OTHERMALE:The rumor is she dated Frank Sinatra.
LEADMALE:You know the song "The Lady is a Tramp"? It used to be "Theresa is a Tramp.
SUPMALE:" Well, they had to change it for legal reasons.
LEADMALE:Ma, what are you talking about? Somebody asked me about Frank Sinatra.
LEADFEMALE:We were asking Rose why she's nervous about seeing her daughter.
LEADMALE:Then try to stay on the subject.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you nervous, Rose? I'm nervous 'cause I made Kirstin executor of my will and I have to go over the documents with her.
LEADFEMALE:Well, honey, she's a big girl.
OTHERMALE:I mean, this may not be the most pleasant conversation you two will ever have, but she can handle it.
LEADMALE:There are some things in there that might surprise her.
LEADMALE:Oh, some deep, dark, family secrets?
OTHERFEMALE:No, I just don't know how she'll react.
SUPMALE:Oh, boy, I'd love to put some surprises in my will.
LEADMALE:Like leaving a small remembrance to each of the men who has brought some special joy or pleasure to my life.
LEADFEMALE:Where would they read that will, Blanche? The Astrodome? Or maybe I'll just do something like, "To my sister Virginia, "I hereby bequeath my diamond brooch, my collection of Wedgwood china,
OTHERFEMALE:and all my stock in AT&T.
SUPMALE:"
LEADFEMALE:You have stock in AT&T? I don't have any of those things, but for one brief moment, Virginia would think she'd hit the jackpot.
LEADFEMALE:That's why mm-mm is a tramp.
LEADFEMALE:Are they here yet?
LEADMALE:No, not yet.
SUPMALE:But Rose left for the airport over an hour ago.
OTHERMALE:Wait until you see what I bought.
SUPFEMALE:I found the most stunning silk dress, an incredibly revealing lace nightie, and look, these just adorable sequined socks.
LEADMALE:Sequined socks I think they kind of make a personal statement.
SUPMALE:Yeah, this end up.
LEADMALE:Sophia! Anyway, I'm glad I got back before Kirsten and Charley got here.
LEADMALE:Who's Charley?
SUPMALE:Rose's granddaughter.
OTHERMALE:That's a girl's name, Charley? That's a bookie's name!
SUPFEMALE:She's named after Rose's husband.
LEADMALE:Rose's husband was a bookie?
LEADMALE:He sold insurance.
LEADFEMALE:An even bigger racket! Dorothy, listen.
SUPFEMALE:Before Rose gets here, can I ask you something?
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to answer
OTHERMALE:if you don't want to.
OTHERFEMALE:What is it? If you think it's none of my business, say, "It's none of your business!" You caught me one night sneaking out of the kitchen naked with an Oreo in my mouth.
LEADMALE:We have no secrets.
LEADFEMALE:Now ask your damn question.
LEADMALE:Have you noticed that Rose has been acting peculiar? Yes, Blanche, from the first day I met her.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, since she's been getting ready for her daughter's visit.
SUPMALE:I think it has something to do with her will.
LEADFEMALE:She's just excited about seeing her daughter.
SUPMALE:No, I think it's more than that.
LEADMALE:You know how she said she was nervous about showing her daughter her will? She ought to be, because wills make people do crazy things! Like what, Blanche? Like killing people.
SUPFEMALE:Do you know what they just uncovered in the Duncan Osgood murder case? That the day before she was murdered, Tippi Paxton Osgood had changed her will, making Duncan the sole heir to the Paxton napkin fortune!
LEADFEMALE:That man is guilty!
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on! That's circumstantial evidence! I mean, it's not enough to convict him! Actually, the more damning evidence was a snapshot they found of Duncan dressed in scuba gear, dragging Tippi's body down the stairs, wrapped in a carpet.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it was from their wedding album.
LEADFEMALE:Here we are! This is home! Oh, Charley, Kirsten I want you to meet my friends Blanche and Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Hello, Kirsten! Hiya, Charley! Rose has told us so much about both of you! I'm just so glad you finally got to Miami! When Mom told me she needed me to review the estate papers, I figured it was a perfect excuse to come for a visit.
SUPMALE:It's just a will, Kirsten.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't call it estate papers.
LEADMALE:And while we're down here, I'm gonna go to astronaut camp.
SUPFEMALE:Astronaut camp? There's a camp for astronauts? Is it close by? Down, Blanche.
LEADMALE:It's a special program for young people.
LEADMALE:Isn't that something? My granddaughter wants to be an astronaut! Not really, Grandma.
SUPMALE:I just want to meet boys who want to be astronauts.
OTHERMALE:Me too! Do you wanna give Blanche and Dorothy the presents we brought for them?
SUPMALE:Sure, Mom.
SUPMALE:Oh, you didn't have to do that.
LEADFEMALE:Hope you like it.
SUPMALE:It's very popular in Minnesota.
LEADFEMALE:It's a maple syrup, honey, brown sugar, molasses, Rice Krispie log! One for each of you.
SUPFEMALE:How sweet.
LEADFEMALE:How incredibly sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, now.
LEADMALE:We gotta get you two settled.
LEADMALE:Can you get those, honey?
OTHERMALE:Sure, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you for inviting us to stay with you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you for these lovely gifts!
LEADFEMALE:What are you gonna do with yours?
LEADMALE:It's a log.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to burn it.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, dinner was delicious.
LEADMALE:Oh, it certainly was.
SUPMALE:You must have spent all day in that kitchen.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:It's a simple recipe.
SUPMALE:You just take some mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables and ground lamb and throw them all together.
LEADMALE:Where we come from, it's called Shepherd's Pie.
LEADMALE:Where I come from, it's called garbage.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, please.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, dinner was wonderful, it truly was! Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:It was my husband's favorite.
LEADFEMALE:Charley used to ask for it at least once a week.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I don't believe George ever requested anything special from me.
SUPMALE:At least not in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:No, that's not entirely true.
SUPFEMALE:Once on our anniversary or was it on payday? Anyway, I remember a butcher block table was involved Blanche.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Anybody ready for dessert?
OTHERMALE:I am, Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good.
SUPMALE:I'll slice into that Rice Krispie log.
OTHERMALE:Ah, just coffee.
LEADFEMALE:Let me help you, Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:Honey, you didn't eat your Brussels sprouts.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't like Brussels sprouts.
OTHERMALE:Neither do I.
LEADMALE:Put them in here with mine.
LEADMALE:Mom, your friends are lovely.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, they're two very special people.
SUPMALE:When you first told me you were moving in with some other ladies,
SUPMALE:I was really surprised.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean? I thought, why would anyone who could afford to be totally independent want to live with someone else? Kirsten, I think there's something I should explain.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to, Mom.
LEADMALE:I understand perfectly.
OTHERFEMALE:Meeting Blanche and Dorothy explains everything.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to take a look at my will.
SUPMALE:Mom, you keep your will in the cookie jar? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Every time I used to walk into the kitchen, your father was in the cookie jar.
OTHERMALE:This way, he still is.
OTHERFEMALE:I think I'd better warn you, I know how much you liked my sapphire necklace, but I thought you'd get more use out of the pearl earrings.
OTHERMALE:Mom, these numbers don't make sense.
OTHERFEMALE:They can't be right.
OTHERFEMALE:They're right, Kirsten.
LEADMALE:I had them checked with a lawyer and an accountant.
LEADMALE:But there's nothing here.
LEADFEMALE:Of course there is.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, there's nothing close to what should be here.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy was one of the most successful insurance salesmen in his company.
LEADMALE:You couldn't possibly have gone through everything.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Kirsten, times have changed.
SUPMALE:Money just doesn't go as far as it used to.
LEADMALE:We just came to help.
OTHERMALE:No, actually you were gone so long, we were afraid you two were making another log.
LEADMALE:In 15 years, you managed to piddle away the fortune it took Daddy a lifetime to build?
LEADFEMALE:Kirsten, it's not that simple.
LEADMALE:Just tell me how it happened.
LEADMALE:How could you go through everything Daddy earned? I don't know.
SUPMALE:Bad investments.
OTHERMALE:I guess I got a little greedy.
SUPMALE:You know, get-rich-quick schemes.
OTHERMALE:I lost it all, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Mother, I am so ashamed of you.
SUPMALE:I don't believe it.
OTHERMALE:Well, me neither.
SUPFEMALE:Rose Nylund isn't the kind to squander her money on bad investments.
LEADFEMALE:It's true! I did it.
LEADMALE:I guess you two don't know me as well as you think you do.
LEADFEMALE:"Please join us when we return to the air at 6 a.
OTHERFEMALE:m.
SUPFEMALE:"We now conclude our broadcast day with the Blue Angels Squadron accompanied by our national anthem.
LEADFEMALE:" At ease, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, honey, why don't you get some sleep? I can't.
SUPMALE:Do you want to talk about it?
OTHERFEMALE:I can't do that either.
LEADFEMALE:Here you are.
LEADMALE:I just spent five minutes telling your bathroom door that everything's gonna be fine between you and your daughter.
SUPMALE:You should never lie to anyone.
OTHERMALE:OK, it was only three minutes, but still! I stood there like a fool.
SUPMALE:Even if lying seems like a good idea at the time.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Rose.
OTHERMALE:What are you talking about? Is this about Kirsten? Oh, Kirsten wouldn't lie.
OTHERMALE:I raised her better than that.
LEADFEMALE:Except for a little white lie, but that doesn't really count.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes, it does! A lie is a lie, which is a sin, which sends you straight to hell!
SUPMALE:Who told a lie?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, who hasn't? Me.
SUPMALE:I never lie.
SUPMALE:Ma, how much did you lose at the dog track last week? None of your business, and that's the truth.
SUPFEMALE:What's the biggest lie you've ever told? I once told my sister Charmaine that she was left on our doorstep by gypsies.
LEADMALE:What? Blanche, why would you want to do a thing like that? She annoyed me.
SUPFEMALE:Always mouthing off about how her hair was curlier than mine, her complexion was prettier than mine.
LEADMALE:I finally said there was good reason for it
SUPFEMALE:she was left by gypsies! I had her completely convinced! What did she say when you told her the truth? Oh, I never did.
SUPFEMALE:I even tried to help her find her little old gypsy mama.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I lied to Stan.
LEADFEMALE:I used to tell him how great he was in bed.
LEADMALE:It was really very difficult, but fortunately, I only had to tell him on his birthday.
LEADMALE:So you see? Everybody bends the truth now and then.
LEADFEMALE:It's not a crime.
LEADFEMALE:But I lied to Kirsten.
LEADFEMALE:Now she hates me for it!
OTHERMALE:Then tell her the truth!
SUPFEMALE:I can't! If I tell her the truth about the money, then she'll find out the truth about her father! I can't let that happen.
LEADFEMALE:I just can't.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
OTHERFEMALE:My God! It's worse than I thought! Why, this is more baffling than the Paxton Osgood case! First, Rose had to lie about the money, and now she's hiding some deep, dark secret about Charley! Well, Blanche, whatever it is, it is none of our business.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go to bed.
LEADMALE:No, of course it's our business! We're friends, we're roommates! I have no secrets from you.
SUPMALE:My whole life is an open book.
LEADFEMALE:Your whole life is an open blouse.
OTHERFEMALE:Charley! Charley, lunch is ready.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Did you and Mommy make up yet? No, not yet.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, but we will.
LEADFEMALE:My, don't you look lovely!
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:I have a date.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I see.
SUPFEMALE:Anybody I know? His name is Robert.
LEADFEMALE:He lives in a castle.
LEADFEMALE:A castle? Oh, that's very exciting! Would you like some help with your makeup? OK.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I used to go out with a Robert.
LEADMALE:His father owned the movie house in town.
LEADFEMALE:One month, I saw the same picture Sounds like cable.
LEADMALE:So tell me about Robert.
SUPFEMALE:What's he like?
SUPMALE:He's a lot like Grandpa.
SUPFEMALE:Does he look like Grandpa?
SUPFEMALE:No, he looks like Bruce Springsteen.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, then how is he like Grandpa? He works very, very hard and he's very, very rich.
SUPMALE:And what else?
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:That's all I've ever heard about Grandpa.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I see.
LEADMALE:Oh, I wish you'd known Grandpa, Charley.
LEADMALE:You'd have liked him a lot.
SUPMALE:Do you think he would have liked me? Liked you? He would have adored you! Do you think that this is the right outfit to wear to a castle? Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:And you'll be glad of that sweater.
LEADMALE:Castles can be very drafty.
SUPFEMALE:Are you two coming? The spaghetti is getting cold! We'll be there in a minute.
LEADFEMALE:We're in the middle of a makeup lesson.
LEADFEMALE:I hope the kid can help you.
LEADFEMALE:You wear more rouge than Miss Piggy! That's it! I'm out of here! Ma, what's the matter? I can't sleep! All night long, tossing and turning! I'd get more rest on Space Mountain! I'm sorry, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:I can't help it.
OTHERFEMALE:I could live with the tossing and turning.
SUPFEMALE:Your cold feet are what's driving me crazy! It's like having two size-nine Fudgesicles pressed up against my butt.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, will you knock it off? I have to get back to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good.
SUPMALE:I'm so glad you're awake! I'm so glad you're awake! I'm taking my bed back! Fine! Rose, get into bed.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, get out of here, and take your teeth with you! Don't make fun of your mother.
LEADMALE:If I didn't wake up tomorrow,
LEADFEMALE:you'd never forgive yourself!
OTHERFEMALE:I'll risk it! Dorothy, do you feel like talking? Oh, honey, if it can wait until morning, I'd really appreciate it.
SUPMALE:I'm exhausted.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:I am too.
OTHERMALE:Let's just get some sleep.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, you're sleeping with a liar.
OTHERMALE:Don't worry about it, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Most of the people I've slept with were liars.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, a lie is like a snowball.
OTHERMALE:You start out with one little harmless lie, and then you have to tell another one to cover up the first.
LEADMALE:And then another, and another.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I mean? And then before long, you've got an entire snowman built out of lies! Dorothy? I was gonna let Kirsten leave tomorrow and never tell her the truth.
LEADMALE:I was willing to risk having her hate me to protect Charley's memory.
LEADFEMALE:That's Charley, my husband, not Charley, my granddaughter.
LEADMALE:But you'd know that if you were still awake.
OTHERFEMALE:But then today, I found that the lies that I've been telling about Charley are hurting Charley.
LEADMALE:Husband and granddaughter, respectively.
LEADFEMALE:So tomorrow, I'm just gonna have to stop this lying and tell the truth, no matter how much it might hurt all of us.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I want you to know, that having friends like you really helps me get through times like this.
SUPMALE:Now you sleep well, and I'll see you in the morning.
LEADMALE:I love you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank God.
LEADMALE:I thought you'd never shut up.
SUPFEMALE:Well, whoever said a man is innocent until proven guilty sure said a mouthful! I was wrong about Duncan
LEADMALE:he didn't kill Tippi! Well, what about all that evidence? The scuba gear, the carpet, the dickey? It turns out it was one of their trusted servants
LEADMALE:who was trying to frame poor Duncan.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell me.
SUPMALE:The butler did it? No, he just thought of it.
SUPMALE:He made the maid do it.
OTHERFEMALE:Good morning.
SUPMALE:Morning, Kirsten.
LEADMALE:I think your mother was looking for you.
OTHERMALE:I've been to the airline office, changing our tickets.
LEADMALE:We're leaving this afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:Where's Charley? On the lanai.
LEADMALE:My mother is trying to help her put Barbie's hair back on with Poligrip.
SUPMALE:Oh, Kirsten, you're back.
LEADMALE:I want to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:Not now, Mother.
SUPMALE:I promised Charley I'd take her to lunch and then we pack.
SUPMALE:We're leaving early.
LEADMALE:Now.
SUPMALE:It's important.
SUPFEMALE:Mother, there's nothing to talk about.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yes, there is.
LEADMALE:And I should have done it a long time ago.
LEADMALE:Kirsten, your father wasn't who you thought he was.
LEADMALE:Oh, I don't think it's necessary for all of us to be here.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:Bye, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Don't go.
LEADMALE:I want you all to hear this.
LEADMALE:I lied about the money.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't squander it on bad investments.
SUPFEMALE:I couldn't have.
SUPMALE:He didn't leave me any to begin with.
LEADFEMALE:Mother, what are you telling me? Your father was a wonderful man, Kirsten.
LEADFEMALE:Kind and warm and caring Never willing to let a friend or a neighbor struggle through hard times alone.
LEADMALE:But he was also the worst businessman to ever balance a checkbook.
SUPFEMALE:But you always told us how successful Daddy was.
SUPFEMALE:He was a success.
LEADFEMALE:As a human being.
LEADFEMALE:But his work took him away so much, I was afraid you wouldn't know that.
SUPMALE:That's why I made him into something he wasn't.
SUPMALE:I guess maybe I was afraid you'd think he was a failure.
LEADMALE:I never thought of him as a failure.
OTHERMALE:I hope I never let him feel like one.
SUPFEMALE:If I did, I can only pray that he forgives me now.
LEADFEMALE:And that you will, too.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, let's go find Charley and take her to lunch.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:With the size of our estate, I think we can afford lunch.
OTHERMALE:So that's it.
LEADMALE:That's the big secret.
OTHERMALE:Charley was a nice guy! Oh, I'm sorry it lacked the intrigue of the Duncan Osgood case.
OTHERFEMALE:But isn't it amazing how things always work out? Rose and her daughter have reconciled their differences and Duncan Osgood can walk the streets a free man.
LEADFEMALE:I guess all's well that ends well.
OTHERMALE:That's easy for you to say.
LEADFEMALE:You're not at the bottom of a lake, clutching someone's dickey.
OTHERMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, what are you doing? Painting numbers on my toes.
SUPFEMALE:I keep forgetting their names.
LEADFEMALE:But Lucy will be here any minute! Honey, this doesn't look very nice.
OTHERFEMALE:I say, let relatives know how you really live.
LEADFEMALE:That way, they don't hang around.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it so happens that my niece and I are very close.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, I'm hoping her interviews go well so she can transfer to a college here and I can see her more often.
LEADMALE:I was never close with any of my nieces.
LEADFEMALE:They all became nuns.
LEADFEMALE:It's hard to shop for a nun at Christmas.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God, I can't believe it!
OTHERMALE:What?
LEADFEMALE:A rat!
LEADFEMALE:A rat?
OTHERFEMALE:It wasn't a rat.
OTHERMALE:It was a cute little mouse.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, it doesn't wear white gloves and work at Disneyland.
LEADMALE:We're talking about a rodent.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I'm calling the exterminator! Oh, no, don't! A mouse saved my life once.
LEADFEMALE:His name was Larry.
LEADMALE:Larry the mouse.
SUPMALE:Oh, I loved Larry.
LEADFEMALE:He used to walk to school with me every day on a little leash I made out of kite string.
OTHERMALE:One day, we were about to cross the bridge down near the schoolhouse, and Larry stopped dead in his tracks.
SUPMALE:No matter how I yanked on that leash, he just wouldn't move.
LEADFEMALE:Suddenly, I heard this loud noise.
LEADFEMALE:The dam upstream had broken, and this rush of water swept the bridge away.
LEADFEMALE:Larry saved my life.
LEADFEMALE:If it weren't for a mouse just like that little one in the kitchen, I wouldn't be sitting here today, telling you this story.
LEADFEMALE:Call the exterminator!
SUPFEMALE:(doorbell
LEADMALE:Oh, my gosh, that must be Lucy.
LEADMALE:All right, now, you-all.
SUPMALE:Please, no more rat talk.
LEADMALE:Ah, Lucy.
LEADMALE:Hi!
OTHERFEMALE:Aunt Blanche! Get in here.
OTHERMALE:I want you to meet my friends.
LEADFEMALE:This is Sophia and Dorothy and Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:Nice to meet you, Lucy.
LEADFEMALE:Let me get a look at you, girl.
SUPFEMALE:Mmm, terrific little figure, gorgeous hair, perfect skin.
LEADFEMALE:Just like looking in a mirror.
LEADMALE:Get some Windex!
LEADFEMALE:How was your trip?
OTHERMALE:Oh, it was wonderful.
LEADMALE:I met a gorgeous, single doctor on the plane.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, at 30,000 feet, she picks up a doctor.
SUPFEMALE:Now I see the family resemblance.
OTHERMALE:In fact, I'm supposed to meet him in a half hour, if that's OK.
SUPMALE:But darling, you just got here.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt Blanche, you always said, "If you've got a stallion eating oats out of your hand, best close the gate before you give him the sugar.
LEADMALE:" You said that, Blanche? I won't go if you don't want me to but I do want to go, so can I?
LEADMALE:Would your mother let you go?
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Then go.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you! Oh, you're the best! I'll see y'all later! Oh, isn't she something! I'm really proud of her.
LEADFEMALE:Now, if I could just manage to rope myself a doctor that easily.
LEADMALE:Honey, I don't think there's enough sugar left in the bowl.
LEADFEMALE:He's back! I saw him running across my dresser.
LEADMALE:Who's back?
LEADMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:J.
OTHERMALE:Simpson, Rose.
LEADMALE:The rat is back!
LEADMALE:He's not a rat, he's a mouse.
LEADMALE:He is history! I'm calling the exterminator.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Don't do that.
SUPFEMALE:I'll talk to him.
LEADMALE:What, you'll talk to the exterminator?
SUPMALE:No, the mouse.
LEADMALE:I can communicate with animals.
LEADFEMALE:He's just a little field mouse who's lost his way.
SUPMALE:He'll listen to me.
OTHERMALE:Mice always have.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, do you have any idea how weird you are? Girls, I am just beside myself.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong?
SUPMALE:Lucy didn't come home last night.
OTHERFEMALE:Her bed has not been slept in.
LEADFEMALE:Calm down, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna call the police.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, I'm sure she'll be fine.
LEADMALE:I mean, what's the worst that can happen to a 20-year-old girl in Miami? Oh, my God.
SUPMALE:Oh, good morning! Lucy? For heaven's sake, where have you been, girl? I've been worried sick! Aunt Blanche, only you could understand what happened.
SUPFEMALE:I am in love!
LEADMALE:The doctor? Oh, he took me on his boat for a midnight cruise.
LEADFEMALE:It was incredible.
LEADMALE:I've only known him a few hours, but the evening was so perfect.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't get any sleep, and I have my interview this afternoon.
LEADMALE:I just have to tell you all about it later.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe it.
OTHERFEMALE:Neither do I.
LEADFEMALE:Imagine, landing herself a doctor, and she still wants to finish college.
LEADMALE:That should give them something to talk about back in Dogpatch.
LEADFEMALE:Do you approve of what Lucy did? No, but I am not passing judgment.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, things are very different these days.
LEADMALE:She seems like a levelheaded girl, and who knows? Maybe she did fall in love.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't do this sort of thing all the time.
LEADMALE:Sophia, do you think it's right for a girl to sleep with a man on their first date? It's a sin!
LEADMALE:See, Sophia agrees with me.
OTHERMALE:All I said was, it's a sin.
LEADMALE:Personally, I'd go back to eating fish on Friday if His Holiness gave that one the green light.
LEADMALE:We're out of milk.
SUPMALE:King me.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you can't do that! It's a perfectly legal double jump.
LEADMALE:Yes, but I'm black, you're red! It's supposed to be a friendly game.
LEADMALE:All of a sudden, you're playing Vegas rules?
LEADFEMALE:Hi, everyone!
SUPMALE:Lucy, honey, how did the interview go? Oh, fantastic! Is Aunt Blanche here? I want to tell her all about it, and that I won't be home for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, your gorgeous doctor taking you for another midnight cruise? Oh, no.
SUPMALE:Tonight I'm going out with Michael.
LEADFEMALE:Michael isn't the doctor?
SUPFEMALE:No, Michael's from the university.
SUPFEMALE:He's the one who interviewed me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he's an absolute dream, he really is.
LEADMALE:He is the most stunning hunk of masculinity I have seen since since Since the dazzling doctor from last night?
OTHERFEMALE:Lucy, darling, how did the interview go?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it was great, Aunt Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I have a feeling I'm gonna be spending a lot more time here with you in Miami.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's wonderful! I hope you won't be upset if I'm not home for dinner tonight or tomorrow night.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Lucy! Please, Aunt Blanche.
LEADMALE:He wants me to fly to the Bahamas with him.
LEADMALE:The Bahamas? Well, I suppose you do have to celebrate doing so well this afternoon.
SUPMALE:So, what the heck? Go on!
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank you! I knew you'd understand.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you-all later.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm so happy things are going so well for her.
LEADMALE:Practically accepted into college, now she's flying to the Bahamas with a doctor.
LEADMALE:Uh, Blanche, this trip to the Bahamas
LEADMALE:it is not with the doctor.
LEADMALE:What do you mean?
LEADFEMALE:Girl's a slut.
LEADMALE:That's not what I meant, exactly.
LEADFEMALE:No, she's going to the Bahamas with the college interviewer she met this afternoon.
OTHERMALE:This is the second man she's gone away with since she arrived yesterday.
LEADMALE:Well, she's 20 years old.
LEADFEMALE:She's a young lady.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have any right to butt into her life.
OTHERMALE:I think you should talk to her mother.
LEADMALE:I can't do that.
LEADFEMALE:Why not?
LEADFEMALE:Because Lucy trusts me.
OTHERMALE:Ever since she was a little girl, she and I have confided in each other.
SUPMALE:If I betrayed that trust, she'd never forgive me.
SUPFEMALE:I'd never forgive myself.
LEADMALE:Then I think you should talk to her as soon as she gets back.
SUPMALE:I think you're right.
LEADMALE:I need to straighten this out.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what to say to her.
LEADFEMALE:I used to know a girl like that in Sicily.
LEADMALE:She slept with every Tom, Dick, and Vito in our village.
LEADMALE:Finally, the women took matters in their own hands.
SUPMALE:They dragged her to the outskirts of town, threw her on the ground, and asked her,
LEADFEMALE:"Why? Why would you do such a thing?"
LEADFEMALE:What did she say? "What else is there to do in this godforsaken village?" Ma, what does this have to do with Lucy? Not a thing.
OTHERFEMALE:It's the only slut story I know.
LEADMALE:I'll just be a minute.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Lucy, you're home.
SUPMALE:Aunt Blanche, what are you doing up? I was waiting up to talk to you, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess I dozed off.
SUPMALE:Well, what is it? Is anything wrong?
SUPMALE:No, everything's fine, really.
LEADMALE:Why don't you say good night to your friend and I'll meet you in the kitchen? Uh, Aunt Blanche, wait.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't gonna say good night to Ed.
SUPFEMALE:I was stopping by to pick up a few things.
SUPMALE:What?
LEADMALE:Well, it was on the way.
SUPMALE:I'm in that new complex over on Lakefront.
SUPFEMALE:By the way, I'm Ed Collins, Miami Vice.
LEADFEMALE:Miami what? Vice.
SUPMALE:Ed's with the police department.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:I thought he was with the university.
SUPMALE:No, actually, before you left last night, I thought he was the doctor from the plane and Dorothy explained to me that he was the university interviewer.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, that was Michael, the guy I flew to the Bahamas with.
LEADMALE:I just met Ed at the airport.
LEADMALE:He arrested Michael for transporting marijuana from the islands.
LEADMALE:Boy, you think you know somebody.
SUPFEMALE:I see.
SUPMALE:Well, Ed picking up Michael was doing his job.
LEADMALE:You picking up Ed is something I think the two of us have to discuss.
OTHERMALE:Ed, it's been a real pleasure.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Lucy, you're grounded for the rest of your stay.
SUPFEMALE:Aunt Blanche, wait.
SUPFEMALE:You're embarrassing me.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you get a good night's sleep, and we'll talk when I get home tomorrow? I don't think you heard what I said.
LEADFEMALE:You are not going anywhere.
LEADMALE:Aunt Blanche, I'm 20 years old.
LEADMALE:I'm going where ever I please.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Ed.
SUPMALE:You walk out that door, missy, you can forget about coming back! Lucy! Lucy! I just don't understand it.
LEADMALE:I forbade her to go, and she looked me straight in the eye and walked out the door! Honey, you have to understand.
LEADFEMALE:Lucy's experiencing her first taste of freedom.
LEADFEMALE:She's going through a rebellious stage.
SUPMALE:Sweetie, it's part of growing up.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy's right.
LEADFEMALE:I cringe at some of the stunts I pulled when I went through my rebellious stage.
LEADFEMALE:Like what, Rose, squeezing the cows too hard? No like climbing out my bedroom window and stealing my father's truck to drive to a bar in the city to meet Clel Lightener.
LEADFEMALE:Clel Lightener? I think I used that on my hair once.
LEADMALE:Oh, Clel was the cutest boy at our high school.
LEADMALE:He was also the only sophomore old enough to get into a bar.
LEADFEMALE:So what did you do when you got there? I sat in the truck for hours, paralyzed with fear.
LEADFEMALE:I kept thinking to myself, "What is a simple Protestant farm girl doing in the parking lot of a gin mill in a flashy, fast-paced city like Tyler's Landing?"
SUPFEMALE:So did you get out of the truck or what?
LEADFEMALE:Of course.
SUPMALE:I marched up to the door, and I ran right into Reverend Mackenzie coming out of the bar on the arm of Millie Beasley wife of Emmett Beasley, our town's most decorated war hero.
LEADFEMALE:Emmett received three Purple Hearts all for head wounds.
LEADFEMALE:He ran the feed store in our town.
OTHERFEMALE:'Course, if the truth be known, Millie was the one who had to make change for the customers.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, are you telling a story or performing Our Town? Oh, sorry.
LEADMALE:Anyway, Reverend Mackenzie made a deal with me.
LEADFEMALE:He said if I didn't tell on him, he wouldn't tell on me.
LEADFEMALE:So, I went home.
LEADMALE:Well, did he keep your secret? Till the day he died which was two days later.
LEADMALE:Emmett found Millie and the Reverend skinny-dipping in the church's fountain and he shot the both of them.
LEADFEMALE:A week later, we became Lutherans.
LEADMALE:Rose, that isn't a "teenage rebellion" story.
LEADMALE:That is a "changing religions" story.
SUPFEMALE:It's a "who cares?" story.
SUPMALE:A "why-the-hell- tell-it-in-the-first-place?" story!
LEADMALE:Blanche, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but it's just that I actually went through a very rebellious stage as a teenager.
LEADFEMALE:I know how difficult it can be.
SUPFEMALE:What did you do that was so rebellious? When I was 15, I dropped out of school for a month to become a magician's assistant.
SUPMALE:When I was 16, I ran off with a gas station attendant twice my age to get married in Mexico.
LEADMALE:When I was 17, I hitchhiked to New York, and for two months, I was a Rockette under an assumed name.
LEADFEMALE:Tyler's Landing kind of pales in comparison.
LEADFEMALE:I stand corrected.
SUPFEMALE:How did you get through all that, Blanche? I was lucky enough to have my big sister Charmaine chasing after me, trying to talk some sense into my fool head.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe Lucy could use a big sister herself right now.
LEADFEMALE:If she doesn't already have one, I don't think it's humanly possible.
LEADMALE:I'm going after her!
SUPFEMALE:It's the middle of the night.
SUPMALE:You can't go alone!
LEADMALE:We'll all go.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:What are we screaming at?
LEADMALE:I'm not sure.
SUPMALE:Dorothy?
LEADFEMALE:The mouse, the mouse! Rose, you promised that you'd get rid of it! Oh, I'm sorry, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:I tried to reason with him, but he just didn't seem to understand why he had to leave.
LEADMALE:Oh, I thought I had him convinced, but at the last minute, he changed his mind.
LEADMALE:Which surprised me, because mice aren't usually fickle.
OTHERMALE:But this mouse is an odd duck! Rose, how many head wounds have you had? I know a lot of people prefer Sonny Crockett on the show, but me, I'm strictly a Tubbs man.
LEADMALE:I've never seen the show.
LEADMALE:You've never seen Miami Vice? It's only the best show that's ever been on television ever! (knock on door It's in stereo, for Pete's sake!
LEADMALE:Oh, I'd like to see my niece.
SUPMALE:Sure, come on in.
OTHERFEMALE:Aunt Blanche, I can't believe you're here.
LEADMALE:Haven't you embarrassed me enough already? Lucy, can we please talk in private? Whatever you have to say to me, you can say right here.
OTHERFEMALE:I have no secrets from, um
LEADFEMALE:Ed.
LEADMALE:Ed.
LEADMALE:If you need some privacy, you can use my bedroom.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Please, ladies, have a seat.
SUPMALE:Can I get you ladies anything to drink?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I like your apartment.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:It kind of looks like something out of Miami Vice.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Are you a fan of the show?
OTHERFEMALE:I adore it.
OTHERFEMALE:Me, too! Miami Vice has been the biggest influence on my life.
OTHERMALE:That's why I joined the police force.
LEADMALE:That's why I drive a fancy car.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why I wear expensive Italian suits.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why I'm up to my neck in hock.
OTHERFEMALE:You can't afford all that stuff on a vice cop's salary.
OTHERMALE:Who knew, huh? Aunt Blanche, I'm a grown woman.
SUPFEMALE:I can live my life any way I want to.
LEADMALE:Oh, I know that.
LEADMALE:I just don't think this is the way you really want to live it.
LEADFEMALE:Is it my fault men find me attractive? No, honey.
LEADMALE:What they find you is available, and that's no compliment.
LEADFEMALE:I find this very strange coming from you, Aunt Blanche, 'cause from the stories I've heard, you're not exactly a saint.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're right.
OTHERMALE:I do enjoy the company of gentlemen always have.
SUPFEMALE:I can promise you one thing, Lucy
OTHERMALE:when I'm with a man, it's 'cause I like him, not 'cause I want him to like me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what's wrong with wanting to be liked? Aunt Blanche, do you remember what I looked like as a kid? Oh, yes, I do.
LEADFEMALE:You were a beautiful child.
OTHERMALE:I was not.
LEADMALE:I was short and fat with braces and acne.
SUPMALE:And I used to think to myself, "Oh, I would give anything to be just like my Aunt Blanche
OTHERMALE:to be pretty and popular with lots of friends.
LEADFEMALE:" And then when I turned 16, it seemed like everything changed overnight.
OTHERFEMALE:I shot up and out, the braces came off and finally, the boys started to notice me.
LEADMALE:And it was nice to be noticed, to be liked.
SUPMALE:Oh, baby.
SUPMALE:Honey, you've been trying so hard to get everybody to like you that you never got around to liking yourself.
LEADFEMALE:And if you don't like yourself, you can't respect yourself, and if you can't respect yourself, neither can anybody else.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you come on home? We still have one more week before you have to leave.
LEADMALE:I don't want to spend it fighting.
LEADMALE:I want to enjoy being with my favorite niece! Ohh! OK, how about this one
SUPFEMALE:what was the name of the informant who Crockett and Tubbs accidentally set up in the "Cool Running" episode? There's no way! That was Noogie, better known on the street as "the Noog Man.
OTHERMALE:" Rose, you're just incredible on Miami Vice trivia.
SUPMALE:I've never met anyone so smart! Ed, for a policeman, you've led a very sheltered life.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, everybody, we're going home.
SUPMALE:But I just put popcorn in the microwave.
LEADMALE:Oh, listen, Ed, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:You're a nice guy, but I have to go.
OTHERMALE:I understand, Lucy.
LEADFEMALE:Would you mind if I gave you a call sometime? Sure, I guess that'd be OK.
LEADFEMALE:Not you, Lucy.
LEADMALE:I was talking to Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I don't think so.
SUPMALE:Are you sure? Tuesday night, I'm getting together with a couple of buddies.
LEADFEMALE:We're going through Don Johnson's trash! No.
LEADMALE:Goodnight, Ed.
SUPMALE:We're going to go home now.
OTHERMALE:And I want you to know, we'll all sleep a lot better knowing you're off duty tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Gotcha! Trapped like a rat.
SUPMALE:OK, so you're a mouse.
OTHERMALE:Either way, you're out of here! Oh, listen, you had your chance to leave, and you didn't take it and now I have to kill you.
LEADMALE:I mean, I'm probably doing you a favor.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, what kind of life are you having? What, you hang around sewers, you eat garbage.
SUPFEMALE:That's not living, honey.
SUPMALE:Now, believe me, you'll be better off once I put you out of your misery.
LEADMALE:I have never killed another living thing in my entire life.
LEADMALE:All right, a bug.
LEADMALE:Yes, I have killed bugs but they don't count.
SUPMALE:I don't know why, they just don't! I don't believe this! I'm talking to a mouse.
SUPMALE:The scary part is, I think you're listening.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look, I beg you, mammal to mammal.
SUPFEMALE:Please go! Look, the exterminator said that you came in through a hole under the sink.
SUPMALE:Please, that's the way I'd like you to go.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good boy! Ohh! You have the gift! Oh! Oh! Oh, Rose! Tell me, how long have you been standing there? Dorothy, I heard you talking to that little mouse.
SUPMALE:It was beautiful.
SUPFEMALE:I wasn't talking to a mouse.
SUPMALE:Yes, you were.
SUPFEMALE:I saw you.
LEADFEMALE:I was kidding! Oh, Dorothy, it's nothing to be ashamed of! There are only a few of us privileged to have the gift to communicate with animals.
LEADFEMALE:Lucy's ready to leave.
LEADMALE:Come on, let's say goodbye.
OTHERMALE:We'll be right there.
LEADMALE:Rose Nylund, if you ever breathe a word of this to anyone,
SUPFEMALE:I swear I'll kill you!
LEADMALE:Oh, Dorothy, don't be silly.
LEADMALE:You couldn't even kill a little mouse.
SUPMALE:That's because you can communicate with them.
SUPMALE:Oh, Dorothy, one word of caution.
LEADMALE:It's a powerful gift use it wisely.
LEADMALE:You let me know the minute you decide where you're going to school.
SUPMALE:I will.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you for loving me so much.
SUPMALE:These last few days have really made a difference.
LEADMALE:Sophia, oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, Rose, I hope I wasn't too much trouble.
OTHERMALE:Don't be silly.
LEADMALE:No, we enjoyed having you.
OTHERMALE:So did half of Miami.
LEADMALE:Ma!
SUPFEMALE:Have a safe trip!
OTHERMALE:OK.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPFEMALE:Bye, darling.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, exactly what did you say to Lucy that night at Ed's apartment? Oh, I told her a lot of things.
LEADMALE:I told her she was a bright, charming, funny young lady who didn't have to rely upon sex to be liked.
OTHERMALE:Well, good for you, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I hadn't realized how much she's been looking up to me.
SUPFEMALE:I think the thing that really turned her around was when I told her that when it comes to men, I'm just a lot of talk.
LEADMALE:Embellishment's one of the oldest traditions in the South.
LEADMALE:Tall tales and tall drinks.
SUPFEMALE:I don't really sleep around near as much as I say I do.
LEADFEMALE:Is that true, Blanche? Maybe it is and maybe it isn't!
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:OK.
SUPFEMALE:I am OK.
OTHERFEMALE:Just don't step too hard.
LEADMALE:Just sit down on the sofa.
LEADFEMALE:I'm all right.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God! What is it? What happened? Nothing, nothing, Ma.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, I'm just fine.
LEADFEMALE:It's nothing serious.
LEADMALE:Probably just a pulled muscle.
LEADFEMALE:It happened in class when she tried to do a six-count Cincinnati riff with a double pullback.
OTHERFEMALE:Goes something like this.
LEADMALE:Margaret Weinstein did the same thing when they changed her medication.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think she could take Dorothy's place in the recital? Oh, come on, honey.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be fine by next week.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe you should have it checked by a doctor.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:It's a very simple thing that comes and goes.
OTHERFEMALE:I've had it for years.
SUPMALE:I probably just overdid it in class tonight.
LEADMALE:I do think you ought to have it checked out.
LEADMALE:It's perfectly all right.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, what is that you're knitting? A bottle cover for the sherry.
OTHERMALE:Why do we need to cover the sherry? Not the sherry here in the house.
LEADFEMALE:The sherry I take to the park.
OTHERFEMALE:You drink out of a paper bag in the park and suddenly everybody's your friend.
SUPMALE:Oh, Sophia, I don't think it's a good idea to drink in the park.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I do it once a month with the girls from the Cloud Society.
OTHERFEMALE:The Cloud Society? Yeah, we stake out a bench, knock a few sherries back, and discuss what we think the clouds look like.
OTHERMALE:One afternoon, I thought I saw Pat Sajak riding sidesaddle on a dolphin.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna get something to eat.
LEADMALE:Good idea.
LEADFEMALE:There's that salad in the fridge.
LEADMALE:Sophia? No, I have to finish this.
SUPMALE:Knit one, purl two.
LEADMALE:Five, six, seven, eight.
LEADMALE:Knock it off, Rose.
OTHERMALE:It's just that I've always dreamed about learning to tap dance.
SUPMALE:And I guess I get too gung-ho about things.
SUPFEMALE:When I was a child, I used to get overexcited and pet the cat too hard.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, oh!
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what is it?
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing.
LEADMALE:Sit down! Nothing, nothing, I'm all right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm fine.
SUPMALE:No, you are not and I'm tired of watching you suffer! That's what Daddy said to our horse, Old Toby, when he broke his leg.
SUPMALE:Then he shot him.
SUPFEMALE:Your family was awfully tough on pets, weren't they, Rose? This could be more serious than you think.
LEADMALE:Why don't you have a doctor look at that foot?
LEADFEMALE:I already have.
LEADMALE:When?
LEADFEMALE:You don't want to miss the recital.
LEADFEMALE:I it is fine! Oh, really? Let's see you do a Cincinnati time step.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:And Ooh!
OTHERMALE:Oh, honey! Oh, all right, all right, I'll go! For the sake of the act.
OTHERFEMALE:If you really want to do something for the sake of the act, have one of those two left feet made into a right one! Rose! Blanche! Dorothy! Go, Dorothy, go! Gosh, I didn't realize how long Dorothy's solo is.
LEADFEMALE:I sure hope the doctor says she's gonna be all right! I won't dance.
SUPMALE:Don't ask me.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God!
LEADMALE:Dorothy, are you all right?
SUPMALE:Oh, honey!
SUPMALE:It's not as bad as it looks.
SUPMALE:The doctor says I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:I just have to take it a little easy for a few days, that's all.
OTHERFEMALE:You're lying!
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Sophia, Dorothy wouldn't lie! A mother knows when her child is lying
SUPMALE:it's like bat radar.
SUPFEMALE:Now what did the doctor really say?
LEADMALE:He said I have to have surgery.
LEADFEMALE:Surgery? For what?
LEADMALE:For kicks, Rose! No, I have a condition called Morton's Neuroma.
SUPMALE:Oh, I think I had that once.
OTHERMALE:But how the heck did you ever catch it in your foot? It's a very small tumor, Ma.
LEADMALE:I've had it for about 20 years.
LEADFEMALE:A tumor? It sounds serious!
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no! It's a very simple surgical procedure.
OTHERFEMALE:As a matter of fact, I'd only be in the hospital overnight.
LEADMALE:That's it?
OTHERFEMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:Oh, what a relief.
LEADFEMALE:When are you gonna have the surgery?
LEADFEMALE:Never.
SUPMALE:You just now said yourself it's a very simple procedure.
LEADMALE:Oh, it is
LEADFEMALE:for the doctor.
LEADFEMALE:But it happens to be my foot that he wants to cut open.
SUPMALE:So you intend to limp around in pain when you could be completely cured in just one night?
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, that doesn't make sense!
SUPFEMALE:It makes sense to me.
LEADMALE:I don't like doctors, I don't like hospitals.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody likes hospitals, but there's nothing to be scared of.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really, Rose? What about blood? What about death? What about those nighties that don't close up in the back? Well, anybody can make it sound unpleasant.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, you are being irrational.
SUPFEMALE:Now the bottom line is we're talking about your health! That is a very precious thing! The longer you put this surgery off, the more you may be risking your health! I just don't think that's a risk worth taking, do you? Yes.
LEADMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Don't have the surgery.
LEADMALE:Let me suffer.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, it's my foot.
SUPMALE:Your foot? My heart.
OTHERMALE:Do you have any idea how much a mother suffers when she sees her child in pain?
LEADFEMALE:Look, Ma, Ma, don't do this!
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you how much.
LEADMALE:Worse than the 23 hours of labor it took to bring you into this world.
LEADFEMALE:bring you into this world.
LEADFEMALE:Worse than the burns I got working nights as a fry cook to help put you through college.
LEADMALE:Worse than the time
OTHERMALE:All right, all right, Ma! I'll have the surgery! You win! You always win.
LEADFEMALE:But you don't play fair.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why I always win.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what you have been complaining about.
LEADFEMALE:I think this is a very good hospital and a perfectly lovely room.
SUPMALE:Isn't it a lovely room, Rose? Very lovely.
LEADFEMALE:I just keep wondering how many people have never left this room.
SUPMALE:Where are they, Rose? Hiding in the shower? She means a lot of people have probably croaked in here.
LEADFEMALE:I know what she means, Ma.
LEADMALE:I just don't need to hear it the night before surgery! Come on, don't be such a baby! I had my appendix out in a hospital in Sicily.
SUPFEMALE:That was rough! Why? They didn't believe in anesthesia back then.
LEADMALE:They had a nurse hold a pillow over your face so the other patients couldn't hear your screams.
OTHERFEMALE:You had to pay extra for that.
LEADFEMALE:Sicily, love it or leave it.
LEADMALE:Visiting hours are over, ladies.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody will have to leave.
LEADMALE:Whoa, where do you think you're going?
SUPFEMALE:You said everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Get back in bed.
SUPFEMALE:Take care, darling.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
OTHERMALE:Goodnight, pussycat.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll see you first thing in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:I hope I can say the same thing.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Zbornak, my name is Dr.
LEADMALE:Ravel.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hello.
LEADFEMALE:I'm here to tell you that Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Ashton won't be able to perform your surgery tomorrow.
OTHERMALE:He's been subpoenaed in a malpractice suit.
LEADFEMALE:You are kidding?
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid not.
LEADMALE:He's a damn fine doctor, too.
LEADMALE:I wish I were half the doctor he is.
SUPFEMALE:By the way, I'll be performing your surgery tomorrow.
SUPMALE:Look, couldn't this surgery wait until he gets back? Well, if he gets a hostile jury, you may have to wait three to five years.
LEADFEMALE:You'd be surprised how peeved people get nowadays over any little mix-up.
LEADMALE:Mix-up? I didn't say mix-up and there's no one here to prove that I did.
OTHERFEMALE:If you'll just sign these forms, we'll be all set.
OTHERFEMALE:Forms?
SUPMALE:They're just your standard consent forms.
LEADFEMALE:Releasing us from all liability in the unlikely event of your death.
LEADFEMALE:I'm having a simple operation! How could I possibly die? Oh, it's possible, believe me! Just ask Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Ashton.
LEADMALE:Listen, you know, I really don't think this operation is a good idea.
SUPMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Zbornak, relax.
LEADMALE:You have nothing to worry about.
LEADMALE:It's a simple surgical procedure, I'm sure everything will be fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Here.
SUPFEMALE:I'll leave these forms so you can look them over.
LEADMALE:I'll see you in the morning when I get back from court.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute! I want to hear more about this mix-up! I don't know what you're talking about.
LEADFEMALE:Night! What do you think you're doing? I'm giving you the last rites, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Ferguson.
OTHERMALE:I'm not Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Ferguson! Then what are you doing in bed with him? The man's dying, for God's sake! Wait a minute! There is no Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Ferguson in this room!
OTHERMALE:Isn't this room 203?
SUPFEMALE:303.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy, what a day.
LEADMALE:Since I'm here, do you need the last rites?
SUPFEMALE:No, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Have you had your operation yet?
LEADMALE:No, tomorrow morning.
LEADFEMALE:Well, good luck.
LEADMALE:I'm sure everything will be fine.
OTHERFEMALE:But just to be on the safe side, I'll swing by here tomorrow afternoon.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy?
LEADMALE:Yes, Blanche?
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing out there?
LEADMALE:Checking the sprinkler system.
LEADFEMALE:Looks good.
OTHERMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:You get yourself in here! Get in here!
OTHERMALE:Where in the world did you come from?
OTHERFEMALE:The coffee shop at the bus station.
SUPFEMALE:I went there from the hospital to think things out.
LEADMALE:But this toothless old wino who claimed he was Elvis kept hounding me for bus fare to Graceland.
SUPMALE:So I came home.
LEADMALE:Blanche, call the police! I just saw a big, ugly man with a limp walk past my bedroom window! He was wearing Dorothy's coat! But then again, it was dark and I tend to overdramatize.
SUPMALE:What are you doing home?
LEADFEMALE:She snuck out of the hospital!
LEADMALE:She's too scared to have her operation.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy! Look, I couldn't help it! When the doctor came in with the release form, he told me what could possibly go wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:I just panicked!
SUPFEMALE:Darling, nothing is going to go wrong!
LEADMALE:Blanche is right! 'Course, one summer when I was a candy striper, you wouldn't believe the things I saw! Lost patients, mixed-up medications, botched operations Rose, do a big ugly man with a limp a favor and shut up! Dorothy, nobody likes being in the hospital, but it's natural to be afraid.
LEADFEMALE:She's right, darling.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody has fears.
LEADMALE:Now all of my life, I had an incredible fear of flying.
SUPMALE:And I missed out on a lot of things because of that fear! Then, one day No, don't tell me, don't tell me.
LEADMALE:You met a handsome pilot
SUPMALE:he invited you into the cockpit.
SUPMALE:Of course you said yes, as you usually do in these stories.
OTHERMALE:The two of you made passionate love and now you cannot get enough of the friendly skies.
SUPMALE:No, that's not what happened at all!
LEADFEMALE:Then how did you get over your fear?
LEADFEMALE:I never did, but thanks to Dorothy, I now have new hope.
LEADMALE:You see, Dorothy, Blanche is willing to face her fear.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's time you faced yours.
SUPMALE:Look, Rose, forget it! I am not going to have that surgery and no one is going to make me change my mind! I thought I heard you in here! What are you doing home?
LEADMALE:I'm all better, Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, she is not! She's afraid to have the surgery because she has a phobia about hospitals.
SUPFEMALE:Do you know why I have that phobia? Because when I was five years old, I was left alone in the hospital on the day I was having my tonsils taken out.
LEADFEMALE:I was in Cleveland at your Uncle Mario's funeral.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but Pop wasn't.
LEADFEMALE:Of course not, he hated your Uncle Mario.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone hated your Uncle Mario.
SUPMALE:That's how he died
LEADMALE:and nobody saw a thing! Pop left a scared, sick five-year-old all alone at the hospital!
LEADFEMALE:Said he had to go to work.
SUPMALE:He did have to go to work! How else could we have paid for the operation? All I know is, I was alone and terrified and I have never gotten over it.
LEADMALE:I still have that phobia about hospitals.
SUPFEMALE:It's about time you got over it.
LEADFEMALE:Get the keys to your car.
LEADFEMALE:We're taking Dorothy to the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, I am not going.
LEADMALE:OK, fine.
LEADFEMALE:So you don't want to go back to the hospital?
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:You don't want the doctor to operate?
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:Then it's settled.
LEADMALE:We'll do it here.
LEADMALE:Blanche, go boil some water and get me a pillow.
LEADMALE:Rose, sharpen my Ginsu knife.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, pick out a shoe you'd like to bite on.
LEADFEMALE:You're not serious? No, I'm just acting as stupid as you are.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:All right, I'll go back.
LEADMALE:Oh, you always win, don't you?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah!
LEADMALE:You're awfully good at this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the best.
SUPMALE:Here we are.
SUPFEMALE:How come I get the chair with the wobbly wheels?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, looks like you have a new roommate.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, I'm Bonnie.
LEADMALE:Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Glad to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:Now look, are my tests finished? I am tired of being probed, poked, and prodded.
LEADMALE:More men have seen my behind in one day than in my entire life! They'll be in to prep you for surgery in about an hour.
SUPFEMALE:Until then, just relax.
LEADMALE:There aren't enough drugs in the entire building!
LEADMALE:I hope my exercising doesn't bother you.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Not at all.
LEADFEMALE:What is it? Some kind of therapy you have to do? No, I just like to stay healthy.
SUPFEMALE:I hate to break this to you
SUPMALE:you're in a hospital.
LEADFEMALE:The exercises aren't working.
OTHERMALE:Surgery today, huh?
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I might as well warn you, I am not the best patient in the whole world.
LEADMALE:I can put up with you for one night.
LEADMALE:Then tomorrow, it is my turn in the operating room.
SUPMALE:You're having surgery too?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:And you're smiling?
LEADFEMALE:I've had this procedure before.
LEADFEMALE:The first time, I was as nervous as you are.
LEADFEMALE:This time I know what to expect.
LEADFEMALE:You're having the same operation again? Don't they get it right around here the first time? Oh, no, it's nothing like that.
LEADFEMALE:About three years ago, I had a mastectomy.
LEADMALE:And, well, now I'm in for another.
LEADMALE:And you're not scared? I'm petrified.
OTHERMALE:No one's that brave, except in the movies and on television.
LEADFEMALE:But at least this time I know what I'm facing.
LEADFEMALE:I've gone through all the steps before.
LEADFEMALE:I have considered the alternatives, dealt with the reality.
LEADMALE:The last time, I think I started crying the moment the doctor told me, and I didn't stop until they wheeled me off to surgery.
LEADMALE:And then later, I cried because there was so much pain, I didn't think it would ever go away.
LEADFEMALE:But it did.
SUPFEMALE:And it will again.
SUPFEMALE:You get through it.
LEADMALE:You go on.
LEADFEMALE:When it comes right down to it, what other choice do we have? It could have been a lot worse.
SUPMALE:I could have missed these last three years.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, you all right?
LEADFEMALE:How do you feel?
LEADFEMALE:Like a fool.
SUPMALE:Like a damn fool.
LEADMALE:OK, let's go.
LEADMALE:I found your shoes.
SUPFEMALE:They were under Sophia's mattress.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I didn't think you'd find them that fast.
LEADMALE:What's going on, Blanche?
OTHERFEMALE:My foot hurts.
OTHERMALE:I think I caught what Dorothy's got.
LEADFEMALE:You can't catch what Dorothy has.
OTHERMALE:Well, then it must just be sympathy pains.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
OTHERMALE:We're going to be late! Now come on, let's go! No, I don't think we ought to dance tonight.
OTHERMALE:It's just not right.
LEADMALE:We ought to be down at that hospital with Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Sophia's with her! She's out of surgery and she's fine.
SUPMALE:Now, come on, let's go! Rose, I have a confession to make.
SUPFEMALE:Flying isn't the only thing I'm afraid of.
LEADMALE:I also have a fear of performing.
LEADMALE:In front of groups, that is.
LEADMALE:I thought you went to dancing school.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that was different.
SUPMALE:That was partner dancing
SUPFEMALE:up close and personal.
LEADMALE:Rose, what I didn't tell you was, when I was five, Mama enrolled me in a tap-dancing class.
LEADMALE:For six months, we practiced.
LEADMALE:One hour a day, two days a week.
LEADFEMALE:And I was good.
SUPMALE:I was cute and I was good, real good.
LEADFEMALE:And then finally, it came time for the night of the recital.
LEADFEMALE:There were 13 little girls up there with our little Shirley Temple curls and our little starched white pinafores and our little Mary Jane shoes.
LEADFEMALE:Then they opened the curtain and the music started and 12 little girls started to dance.
SUPMALE:And one little girl wet her pants.
OTHERFEMALE:That girl in the puddle was me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, God, I have never told that to another living soul, Rose! You see, I thought I had overcome my fear, honey.
SUPFEMALE:But I just haven't, and performing is a nightmare for me.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, we've all got our sad stories.
LEADFEMALE:What? Look, Blanche, we've practiced for six weeks.
SUPFEMALE:We've paid for our costumes, we told everybody we'd be there! You're not gonna wimp out on me.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna go to that recital.
LEADFEMALE:If you end up in a puddle tonight, well, you'd just better break into "Singin' in the Rain"!
LEADMALE:Ma?
LEADMALE:What?! What are you doing here? You were operated on, you're my daughter, where else would I be?
LEADFEMALE:How long have you been here?
LEADFEMALE:Since they took you to surgery.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't left the room.
LEADFEMALE:Not for a newspaper, not for food, not for a cold drink.
SUPFEMALE:All day, I've been right here.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma.
SUPMALE:Ma, I love you.
OTHERMALE:Could you fluff up my pillow a little, please? What, I look like an orderly? Push the button, wake up a nurse! I'm just here for moral support.
LEADFEMALE:I already got that from my roommate.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, she's gone.
LEADFEMALE:And I never thanked her.
LEADMALE:Relax, she's not the Lone Ranger, she'll be back.
SUPMALE:I sent her to the cafeteria to get me a sandwich.
LEADFEMALE:Hello!
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:How are you feeling? I'm exhausted.
LEADFEMALE:How's our little patient doing?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, fine, just fine.
LEADMALE:A little groggy, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:But you're not in any pain?
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not.
SUPMALE:Slight discomfort.
LEADFEMALE:You want discomfort? Try sitting in this chair for eight hours.
LEADMALE:How was the dance recital?
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:We were great!
LEADFEMALE:They loved us! We've been invited to dance next month at the Sunset Charity Ball! And there's even some talk about us going up to Palm Beach to be in the cotillion! Oh, that's wonderful! And I'll be back and in dancing shape by then!
SUPFEMALE:Oh
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:We've changed our act.
LEADMALE:We're no longer the Tip Tap Trio.
LEADMALE:Who are we now? Well, we're now known as The Two Merry Widows! Hit it, Blanche! Oh, that was the most adorable dance I think I've ever seen.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, honey, could I look at your hat for a minute? 
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Morning, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Taste this.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's awful.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter with it? It's expired.
OTHERFEMALE:But sometimes it's good after the date.
LEADMALE:I just wanted to check.
LEADMALE:You look tired, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Rose kept me up all night.
OTHERMALE:Oh, why? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:She was afraid of the storm.
LEADMALE:knocks on my door, crying, begging, pleading to get into bed with me.
LEADFEMALE:Just like your father used to do before we got married.
SUPMALE:So what did you do? I told him, "You're not getting anything till you put a ring on my finger and a donkey in my father's barn!" Not Pop, Rose! I told her to get the hell out of my room.
LEADMALE:Oh, Sophia, I want to explain about last night.
SUPFEMALE:When I was a little girl, one summer we had a terrible thunderstorm Excuse me, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Have I given you any indication at all that I care? Girls, my father's coming! Big Daddy's coming! He just called! Oh, Big Daddy's gonna be in Miami tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it! I can't believe I know anyone who calls her father Big Daddy! Back home, everybody calls him Big Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Why, he's the most respected and beloved man in our town.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, for as long as I can remember, people from all over the county would drive up to Twin Oaks that's the name of our house to ask Big Daddy's advice on one thing or the other.
OTHERFEMALE:And while the men were discussing business on the veranda, the ladies would retire to the shade of an old magnolia to sip mint juleps and exchange prize-winning pecan pie recipes.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell me, Blanche, during any of this, would the farm hands suddenly break into a chorus of "Them Old Cotton Fields Back Home"? Well, maybe I am exaggerating just a touch, but not about Big Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he's a very special man.
LEADFEMALE:He has truly been a father to everybody in our town.
LEADFEMALE:Your mother must have been a very forgiving woman.
LEADMALE:Oh! I got a million things to do before Big Daddy gets here.
LEADMALE:I have to go pick up his favorite food and his favorite brandy and cigars.
LEADMALE:I want him to feel right at home.
LEADFEMALE:Then get the Millers across the street to tar and feather their lawn jockey.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna go out on the lanai for awhile.
OTHERFEMALE:The air's always so nice and fresh after a storm.
LEADMALE:As long as you're out there, Rose, why don't you pull some weeds? OK.
LEADMALE:Ma, yesterday you said you were gonna pull the weeds.
LEADFEMALE:I said I'd get it done and it's getting done.
LEADMALE:So lighten up.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, Sophia, come quick! Oh, my God! The storm must have knocked it down last night.
OTHERMALE:Good morning, ladies.
SUPFEMALE:Morning, Mr.
SUPMALE:Barton.
OTHERMALE:Good morning, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Barton.
LEADFEMALE:Well, looks like you had a little bad luck here.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, we certainly did.
SUPMALE:Any damage to your place? Nope.
LEADFEMALE:Not a scratch.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank goodness.
LEADMALE:If the wind had been blowing in the opposite direction, your tree could have fallen into your living room.
LEADMALE:What do you mean, my tree? She means your tree because it was on your property.
SUPMALE:No way, lady, this is your tree.
SUPFEMALE:It's your responsibility.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my goodness! Our tree fell into your yard! Clam up, Gladys.
LEADFEMALE:This is their tree.
LEADFEMALE:Look, there seems to be some confusion here.
LEADMALE:But we are neighbors, what do you say we split the cost and have the tree hauled away? What do you say you have it hauled away and I'll split.
LEADFEMALE:That does it! You don't have any choice.
LEADFEMALE:You're hauling that tree away, capisce? You Italians have got some temper! "You Italians"? With disdain in his voice, he said it.
SUPFEMALE:Now you're gonna pay.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing? It's the Evil Eye.
LEADFEMALE:I just put a Sicilian curse on you.
SUPMALE:You're not gonna have a moment's peace till you haul that tree away! You got me shaking in my boots.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma, why'd you do that? You just made matters worse with that ridiculous curse.
OTHERMALE:Ridiculous? The curse works, believe me.
LEADFEMALE:I've used it before.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, when?
SUPMALE:Baltimore Colts, New York Jets, 1969.
LEADMALE:Draw your own conclusions.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, great news! I stopped by the courthouse this morning and got a copy of our property map.
LEADMALE:The tree definitely belongs to Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Barton and it is his responsibility to remove it.
LEADFEMALE:Play it safe.
SUPFEMALE:Stick with the curse.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma, I've stayed with you all these years.
LEADMALE:Ladies, how do I look? Like the night hostess at Denny's.
SUPFEMALE:This is exactly like the dress I wore to my Sweet 16.
LEADMALE:It was always Big Daddy's favorite.
LEADFEMALE:(doorbell Oh, there he is now! Now listen, girls, my father is an old time southern aristocrat who is used to fine manners and gentility.
LEADMALE:So please, please, please be on your best behavior.
SUPFEMALE:Why is everyone looking at me?
LEADFEMALE:Daddy!
LEADFEMALE:Where's the old lady? Ah-ha! You looking for me, mouth? Ma.
SUPFEMALE:I'm glad you're here, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Barton.
LEADMALE:I went down to the courthouse this morning and This isn't a social call.
OTHERMALE:This morning, when I got in my car, somebody let the air out of my tire.
SUPMALE:I know she did it!
SUPMALE:That's ridiculous! If I catch her on my property, I'm gonna have her arrested.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Barton, I assure you, my mother had nothing to do with your tires.
LEADFEMALE:It was just a coincidence.
SUPFEMALE:Coincidence, my eye.
LEADMALE:Now, about the tree.
SUPFEMALE:I got a copy of our property map at the courthouse this morning, and as you can clearly see, the tree is yours.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:I'm not gonna move it.
SUPFEMALE:Not after what she did.
LEADFEMALE:You have to!
SUPMALE:Sue me!
LEADMALE:We will!
SUPMALE:Fine!
SUPFEMALE:Fine! That jerk! Trying to intimidate us! Just who does he think he is? (doorbell What is it, mouth? Back home, most people start off with, "How do?"
LEADFEMALE:Daddy!
LEADFEMALE:Baby girl! Looking at you takes my breath away! Hair as shiny as the dew on a field of sunflowers.
LEADFEMALE:Eyes that sparkle bluer than the Mississippi, and the prettiest smile on either side of the Mason-Dixon Line! Didn't I tell you my daddy was the smartest man who ever lived? You must be Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:It's a pleasure to meet you.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me for staring, ma'am, but I've always felt that the stunning, classical beauty of an Italian woman should be admired like a fine work of art.
OTHERMALE:You need boots to listen to this guy.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, I want you to meet my best friends.
OTHERFEMALE:This is Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Charmed.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, how do you do? Has anyone ever told you you are the spitting image of Miss Dinah Shore? Oh, no! You're putting me on! Of course he is.
SUPFEMALE:And Daddy, this is Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I hope I didn't offend you.
LEADFEMALE:No harm done, darling.
SUPMALE:Now, I want you to promise me you won't fret none.
LEADMALE:Well, I would, except I'm not exactly sure what "fret none" is.
SUPMALE:Oh, Daddy, I'm so glad to see you!
SUPFEMALE:Get on over here and sit down.
LEADMALE:Oh, I can't stay, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I've got some business to attend to.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:But I'll be back later tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I got a surprise for you! Oh, did you get me something? What is it?
SUPFEMALE:What did you buy for me, Daddy?
LEADFEMALE:Well, nothing, sugar.
LEADMALE:Oh, fiddle-dee-dee.
LEADFEMALE:Fiddle-dee-dee? This is so much fun! It's like being in Gone with the Wind.
LEADMALE:Well, then what is the surprise Daddy? Well, I was gonna save it, but what the heck? I'm singing at the Sagebrush Club tomorrow night.
SUPMALE:You're doing what? I'm singing.
SUPMALE:That's my surprise.
LEADFEMALE:And I want you and your friends to come as my guests.
LEADMALE:But why? Because, darling, I thought they might enjoy it.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, I mean why are you singing? It's my calling.
LEADFEMALE:It's what I do now.
LEADMALE:I'll explain it all to you later.
LEADMALE:Right now, I got to head over to the club and check things out.
LEADFEMALE:But, but Daddy?
LEADMALE:Leave the key under the mat.
SUPFEMALE:Ladies, see y'all later! Uh, I can't believe it! Neither can I! Free tickets! No, I'm talking about my daddy! Why, this singing thing doesn't make any sense! You know, I'm worried about him.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I ought to go call my sisters.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Blanche, you're overreacting! If you're really concerned, why don't you talk to him? You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:That's what I'm gonna do.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna stay completely objective and keep an open mind.
LEADMALE:I'm sure there's some perfectly logical explanation why my daddy's lost the stuffin' out of his comforter.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sorry, darlin'.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't mean to wake you.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that's all right.
SUPFEMALE:I waited up for you.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you did.
SUPFEMALE:I've been working on a new song and I want you to hear it.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, Daddy, I want to talk to you about this singing.
LEADMALE:It's been just wonderful, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I love singing.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I know I'm just getting started and I got a lot to learn, but the audiences will come around.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do just fine.
SUPFEMALE:You know, you're talking about this singing like it's some kind of career.
LEADMALE:Well, it is.
LEADFEMALE:Now, see what you think of this.
SUPMALE:This part needs a little work.
LEADMALE:And then now, here's the chorus.
LEADMALE:No you won't, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Now, put that guitar down, I wanna talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter? Well, I don't know what's gotten into you.
OTHERMALE:Daddy, you're no singer.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I know I'm no Hank Williams yet, but No, no, no, that's not what I meant.
LEADMALE:I mean At your age, just out of nowhere to decide you're just gonna go off and perform in some honky-tonk? I don't know about you, but that sounds pretty crazy to me.
LEADFEMALE:Now, don't you sass me, missy.
LEADMALE:No, I don't mean to sass you, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that I'm concerned about you.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, I want you to promise me that you're gonna forget all about this nonsense and go back to Twin Oaks and have a nice long rest.
LEADMALE:There's no Twin Oaks to go back to.
LEADMALE:I sold it.
LEADFEMALE:You what?! Sold it.
OTHERFEMALE:Sold everything.
LEADMALE:Well, now, if I'm gonna go out on the road and do this thing right, I need money.
LEADFEMALE:All right, this has gone far enough! I will not allow you to disgrace yourself or your family! I absolutely forbid you to go on with this foolishness one minute longer! You forbid Big Daddy? You're the one's gone crazy, girl! I'm sorry you had to witness this spectacle, ladies.
LEADMALE:My apologies.
LEADMALE:Oh, Big Daddy, wait.
LEADMALE:Too late! You know, if there was some rain coming down, and a soft train whistle in the distance, this moment would have the makings of a first-rate country song.
LEADMALE:Bye, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I feel awful, just awful! I shouldn't have lost my temper that way.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, you were upset.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's no excuse.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy obviously doesn't know what he's doing.
LEADMALE:He's lost his grip on reality.
SUPMALE:Oh, honey.
LEADMALE:Maybe it's not as serious as you think.
LEADMALE:Maybe he's just going through a stage.
SUPMALE:My father is not off on some crazy lark, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:He sold our house and our land and everything he spent his lifetime building.
LEADFEMALE:He needs help.
SUPFEMALE:I never thought this could happen to my father.
OTHERMALE:Other people's parents get old and grow frail and need taking care of, but somehow I'd always thought Big Daddy would go on forever.
LEADMALE:Honey, we all think of our fathers that way.
LEADMALE:We remember them as strong and handsome and wise.
LEADFEMALE:When I think of my father, I always picture him pulling a giant tuna up Main Street.
LEADFEMALE:Well, who doesn't, Rose? Oh, it wasn't a real tuna, it was made of chrysanthemums.
LEADMALE:It was the float in the Father's Day Parade.
SUPMALE:You probably don't know this, but my home town was founded by Heinrich von Anderdonnen the first man to ever can tuna in it's own natural juices.
SUPMALE:Anyway, it was the 50th anniversary celebration of the founding of our town and my father was chosen to pull the float.
OTHERMALE:He thought it was 'cause he had the newest tractor, but actually, it was 'cause he was the only one small enough to fit into the mayonnaise jar costume.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'll never forget the moment we caught sight of him, turning off of Sycamore on to Elm.
LEADFEMALE:Something must have happened to the tractor, 'cause there he was, this lone little mayonnaise jar dragging this giant tuna up the hill, past the reviewing stand.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think I've ever been prouder in my life.
OTHERFEMALE:That's very touching, Rose.
SUPMALE:It shouldn't be, but it is.
SUPFEMALE:You know, when I think of my father, I don't remember just one incident.
SUPMALE:I just know that he was always there to take care of me whenever I got into trouble which was all the time.
SUPFEMALE:I just never dreamed that the day would come when the tables were turned and I'd have to take care of him.
SUPMALE:But I guess it has.
LEADMALE:Sophia, why don't you come with us? It might be fun to hear Blanche's father sing.
LEADMALE:To you, Rose, but what do you know about a good time? (doorbell Oh, Mr.
LEADMALE:and Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Barton, what can I do for you?
LEADFEMALE:I wanna see the witch.
SUPFEMALE:Leonard! Don't call her a witch, you'll get another boil on your butt.
OTHERMALE:Tell the world, Gladys! Look, you've won.
SUPFEMALE:I'm begging you, take off the curse, will you? My golf clubs are missing, my clocks are all wrong, I can't sleep, I can't eat! You can't sit.
LEADFEMALE:That, too.
LEADFEMALE:Please take it off.
LEADMALE:Move the tree.
LEADFEMALE:It'll be out of here tomorrow.
LEADMALE:You got a deal.
LEADFEMALE:Does that mean it's gone? That means I shouldn't eat asparagus at dinner.
SUPMALE:That means it's gone.
SUPFEMALE:Let's get out of here, Gladys.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be right there.
SUPMALE:I just wanted to apologize to you ladies.
SUPMALE:Leonard has been just terrible about this whole situation.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why I did all those things to him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! It was you all along! Except for the boil, that was just luck.
SUPFEMALE:Gladys, we've got to go.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, ladies, if there's anything that I can do for you to improve our relationship, I'd be happy to oblige.
SUPFEMALE:There is one small thing.
SUPFEMALE:In the morning when you go out in your robe to pick up the newspaper, wear your shorts.
LEADFEMALE:I've never been in a place like this.
OTHERMALE:Are these all real cowboys? Of course, Rose.
SUPMALE:You can tell because they wear cowboy hats and drink wine spritzers and drive Volvos.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Blanche, who do we see about our table? Oh, I don't know.
LEADMALE:This is the first time I've ever been here.
SUPFEMALE:Well, howdy, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Hi there, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Ladies.
LEADMALE:No, I'm wrong.
LEADFEMALE:I think the museum did have its Christmas party here.
LEADMALE:What's that noise? Oh, they have a mechanical bull in the back room.
OTHERMALE:I read about it in the Sunday supplement.
LEADFEMALE:What on Earth do you do with a mechanical bull? Introduce him to a mechanical cow, Rose.
LEADMALE:Oh, excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:We're supposed to have reservations for the second show.
SUPMALE:The name's Devereaux.
LEADMALE:OK, let's see.
LEADMALE:Uh, hm-mm.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, I don't seem to have you listed.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, maybe it's under the name of Hollingsworth.
SUPFEMALE:Hollingsworth?
LEADMALE:Mm-hm.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, you're not here to see Big Daddy Hollingsworth?
LEADFEMALE:Yes, we are.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, you just missed him.
OTHERFEMALE:But we thought the second show doesn't start until nine.
OTHERMALE:It doesn't.
OTHERMALE:But after the first show, the management cancelled his booking.
LEADMALE:Oh! I was afraid that would happen.
SUPMALE:Do you know where he went? I guess he's backstage somewhere.
LEADFEMALE:You go on honey.
LEADFEMALE:Talk to him.
LEADFEMALE:We'll wait right here.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Howdy, ladies.
SUPMALE:My name's Rusty.
LEADFEMALE:I don't recollect seeing you two fillies 'round these parts.
LEADFEMALE:Mind if a lonesome cowboy puts his saddlebags 'round your campfire? Give us a break, would you, mac? Howdy, ma'am, my name's Rusty.
LEADMALE:Daddy? Sugar.
LEADMALE:I didn't expect to see you here.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, I just heard what happened and I'm so sorry, I truly am.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:It's my own fault.
LEADFEMALE:If I wasn't such a stubborn old fool
SUPFEMALE:Daddy, now don't be hard on yourself.
LEADMALE:Well, it's true.
LEADMALE:I never should have tried that Beatle medley.
SUPMALE:Next time, I'm gonna stick with the material I know.
SUPFEMALE:You mean you intend to go on with this? Why not? Honey, because they didn't like you.
SUPMALE:That's why not.
LEADFEMALE:You weren't any good.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, I know I'm not any good.
LEADMALE:Then I don't understand.
LEADMALE:What? Well, I don't understand how the man I have admired and respected all my life can turn himself into a clown.
LEADMALE:Blanche, honey, ever since I was a boy, I've never been satisfied with what was easy.
LEADFEMALE:I always wanted to try new things, see new places.
LEADFEMALE:But before I had a chance to do something like hop a tramp steamer, I met up with a lady by the name of Elizabeth Ann Bennett.
OTHERMALE:She had the cutest little smile, tiniest button nose, and the most incredible blue eyes I had ever seen.
LEADFEMALE:Those are the things you inherited from her.
LEADMALE:And when I looked into those eyes, they told me it was not time to go off chasing rainbows.
SUPFEMALE:It was time to make a life for the two of us.
LEADMALE:And I never regretted that decision because I knew that someday, we'd go off chasing those rainbows together.
SUPMALE:But when the time finally came, all that was left was a big empty house.
OTHERFEMALE:And a headstone that marks her grave.
LEADFEMALE:And I decided that before it was time for us to be together again, I was gonna go off and have that adventure.
LEADMALE:Now granted, this is no tramp steamer, but it's something.
LEADFEMALE:Something I've always wanted to do.
OTHERFEMALE:And sugar, I think that now is finally the time to do it.
SUPFEMALE:But why didn't you tell me that before? I didn't think I needed to.
LEADFEMALE:I figured if I was happy, you were happy, too.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so sorry.
OTHERMALE:You've always been there for me.
LEADMALE:I should've been there for you.
OTHERMALE:And, you think you could ever forgive me? Darlin', life's too short to not forgive my favorite little girl.
LEADFEMALE:I love you.
OTHERFEMALE:I love you, too.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Ma, what are you doing? It's a funny little habit I picked up.
LEADFEMALE:I call it eating.
LEADMALE:Rose made it for her daughter.
SUPFEMALE:You can't eat till she comes.
SUPMALE:Oh, please, there's enough food here to feed my entire village in Sicily.
SUPMALE:Blanche.
LEADMALE:Help me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my back gave out.
LEADFEMALE:I figured that would be the third thing to go.
OTHERFEMALE:What happened? I was in my aerobics class when I noticed this gorgeous man.
LEADFEMALE:During the buttocks lifts, he motioned for my number.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't wanna appear easy, so I rolled over and flung my legs over my head.
OTHERFEMALE:That's what I call giving him the brush-off.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mom.
LEADMALE:My God, it's Michael.
LEADFEMALE:Michael.
OTHERMALE:Look, Ma, it's Michael.
SUPMALE:Oh, honey, what a surprise.
SUPFEMALE:You look great.
OTHERMALE:I'm glad to see you.
SUPMALE:I've missed you.
SUPFEMALE:Why the hell haven't you written, you little ingrate? He's a musician in New York.
SUPMALE:He hasn't time to write.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Don't hi me.
LEADFEMALE:You can't pick up a phone and call your grandmother? You look terrific, Grandma.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:So give me a kiss.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to meet my friend, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, Michael.
LEADFEMALE:I would get up but I've thrown my back out of whack You don't have to explain.
SUPMALE:Mother told me about you.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't you say you were coming?
OTHERFEMALE:I could have cooked a meal.
OTHERMALE:My job at the jazz club ended so I came here.
LEADMALE:I'm so glad you did.
LEADFEMALE:You play jazz? The only white boy from Brooklyn who could scat.
OTHERFEMALE:But I thought the job was till the end of summer.
LEADMALE:I had artistic differences with the club owner.
LEADFEMALE:People pick on him because he's talented.
LEADMALE:He wanted everyone to wear a tie and I refused.
LEADMALE:Michael stands up for his principles.
LEADFEMALE:He's the Norma Rae of the music business.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody, I want you to meet my daughter, Bridget.
LEADMALE:Bridget, this is Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:And Dorothy.
SUPMALE:And Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:And a total stranger.
LEADMALE:This is my son, Michael.
LEADMALE:He's staying with us.
LEADMALE:Ma, you don't have the space.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be silly, you can have my room.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll camp out on the couch.
LEADFEMALE:Michael, it's nice meeting you.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy's told us about you.
LEADFEMALE:This is my daughter, Bridget.
LEADMALE:Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Bridget's going to study at Oxford, England.
OTHERMALE:I've found a terrific flat on campus.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:I hear the commute from here's a killer.
LEADFEMALE:Pardon me?
SUPMALE:It was a joke.
LEADMALE:Cute.
LEADMALE:Where do you go to school? College isn't really my style.
OTHERFEMALE:I attend the school of life.
LEADFEMALE:A lot of people go there when they can't get accepted anywhere else.
OTHERMALE:Cute.
LEADMALE:Bridget, I know you're hungry after your trip, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I fixed your favourite things.
OTHERMALE:It looks delicious.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:Where are the wooden shoes I carved out of cheese? My mother spread them on the tiny windmill you built out of Triscuits.
SUPMALE:This is my best breakfast in ages.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:Normally she feeds me lumpy oatmeal and black bananas.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do that.
SUPMALE:No, you won't.
SUPFEMALE:You don't have to.
OTHERFEMALE:I enjoy doing it.
LEADFEMALE:Here, why not double your fun?
LEADFEMALE:Good morning.
SUPFEMALE:How's your back?
LEADMALE:Terrible.
LEADFEMALE:What did the doctor say? I am the most spectacular specimen of the female anatomy he has seen since Julie Newmar.
SUPMALE:He said it's a back problem.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank God he's a specialist.
LEADFEMALE:He said no activity for a week.
OTHERFEMALE:I have to wear a corset and lie back with my legs elevated.
LEADFEMALE:That's the same thing you did last Saturday.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, you just follow the doctor's orders and everything'll be fine.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think I can go without physical activity for a week.
LEADMALE:I have serious needs.
SUPMALE:I'm at my sexual peak.
LEADMALE:Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I am, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:When a woman's at her peak
LEADMALE:This is my child.
LEADFEMALE:I wish you wouldn't treat me like a child.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be ridiculous.
SUPMALE:I don't treat you like one.
SUPMALE:Here's $10.
SUPMALE:Go take your grandmother to see The Journey Of Natty Gann.
LEADMALE:Shut up and take the money.
OTHERFEMALE:Forget the movie.
SUPMALE:We'll double our money at the track, and goof on bums.
SUPFEMALE:Michael seems like a nice man.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he really is.
LEADMALE:But I'm worried about him.
OTHERMALE:He's always been a little flighty.
SUPMALE:I wouldn't worry about that.
LEADMALE:Grandma always said I was a little flighty.
LEADMALE:Or was it a little floozy?
SUPFEMALE:Morning, everyone.
LEADFEMALE:You want some breakfast? No.
SUPMALE:Bridget packed a delicious meal and drove me to the country.
LEADMALE:We took a walk and picked wild flowers.
LEADFEMALE:We waded in the creek and then guess what? Julie Andrews showed up, you all fed deer and sang, "If I Had A Hammer".
LEADFEMALE:Rose, sounds like you had a lovely morning.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it was.
SUPFEMALE:But it made me sad.
LEADMALE:I realised how much I'll miss her.
LEADMALE:We've always been close.
OTHERFEMALE:I was the same way with Michael.
LEADMALE:Was? I thought you got on great.
LEADFEMALE:It's not that we don't get on.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that we think differently.
LEADFEMALE:I think he should settle down and find a job.
OTHERFEMALE:He thinks he should be travelling over the country, trying to find himself.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe what Michael needs is a little exposure.
LEADMALE:Exposure to what?
SUPMALE:To plutonium, Rose.
SUPMALE:To somebody more career-oriented, somebody like Bridget.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe if they spent time together, she'd be a positive influence.
LEADFEMALE:Are you suggesting that Michael and Bridget go out? That is exactly what I'm suggesting.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think so.
LEADMALE:I stay out of my children's social lives.
SUPFEMALE:I'm afraid I agree with Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Like that Scandinavian saying, "You can lead a herring to water but you have to walk really fast or he'll die.
LEADMALE:" Alright, fine.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought they'd have more fun together instead of hanging around with me and three old ladies.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get changed.
LEADMALE:Bridget's taking me to the House of Fabrics for the felt sale.
OTHERMALE:I hope I don't get too crazy.
LEADMALE:You'd better take a tranquilliser before you go.
OTHERMALE:Remember, last time, you hyperventilated and almost passed out.
SUPFEMALE:I never passed out at the House of Fabrics.
LEADFEMALE:I passed out at the World of Wool.
LEADMALE:For the first time in my life, my body feels old.
LEADMALE:I can't do the things I used to.
OTHERFEMALE:Rubber Woman couldn't do the things you used to.
SUPMALE:It's only natural that, as you're growing older, your body changes.
SUPFEMALE:It falls apart.
SUPMALE:It does not fall apart.
SUPMALE:For 50 years, I look like Chita Rivera.
LEADMALE:One morning, my butt's like a bulldog's neck.
SUPMALE:I remember when I felt I was getting older.
LEADMALE:I was visiting my daughter.
OTHERFEMALE:She had a walk-up apartment, five flights up.
SUPFEMALE:It got harder and harder each year to climb those stairs.
LEADMALE:Finally, one year, I couldn't make it without stopping.
LEADMALE:It depressed me for weeks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:Is that what I have to look forward to, 15 years from now?
LEADFEMALE:Another game?
LEADMALE:I don't feel like it.
LEADMALE:Play with Michael.
LEADFEMALE:He's not here.
LEADFEMALE:Where is he?
OTHERMALE:You were at the market.
LEADFEMALE:The kids decided to go out.
LEADFEMALE:Michael asked Bridget out?
OTHERMALE:Not exactly, no.
LEADMALE:I just happened to have some free tickets to the symphony.
LEADMALE:So I suggested they take 'em.
SUPMALE:Both Rose and I told you not to interfere with their social lives.
LEADMALE:I just thought it might be fun.
LEADFEMALE:A set-up date is never fun.
OTHERFEMALE:In Sicily, everything is set up.
OTHERFEMALE:Dates, marriage, death.
OTHERFEMALE:Especially death.
LEADMALE:Whenever I go into a restaurant, I sit with my back to the wall.
LEADFEMALE:Except any diner in Newark, where if you're against the wall, you stick.
OTHERMALE:Hi, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Shouldn't you be lying down? But I'm tired of being on my back.
OTHERMALE:Did I just say that? Are the kids back from their date?
LEADFEMALE:Our kids?
LEADFEMALE:No, the Katzenjammer Kids.
SUPMALE:Of course our kids.
LEADFEMALE:We decided not to interfere.
LEADFEMALE:We did, but Blanche here decided differently.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, how could you? Well, I don't know what all the fuss is about.
LEADFEMALE:I heard 'em come in hours ago.
SUPMALE:I'll say good night to Bridget.
LEADFEMALE:Can you bring my heating pad?
OTHERMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, do you realise it's been four days since I've enjoyed the company of a man? I know, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been marking the days off on my Big Ships of the Navy calendar.
LEADFEMALE:I can't stand it much longer.
SUPFEMALE:My body feels like a Corvette on blocks with its engine racing and the wheels just spinning with nowhere to go.
SUPFEMALE:I feel like I'm gonna explode.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, you must help me.
LEADFEMALE:Do something.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, there's nothing I can do.
OTHERMALE:So let go of my hand.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:Hi there.
LEADMALE:Rose, don't look.
LEADFEMALE:Michael, get out of that bed.
LEADMALE:Believe me, Mom, I'd like to.
LEADFEMALE:But as my clothes are hanging on the doorknob, it's not a good idea.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:They're naked.
LEADFEMALE:People usually are in this situation, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Unless they're all dressed up in costumes.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:What's all the commotion? Oh, boy.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't what it looks like.
LEADMALE:I'm 80 years old.
LEADFEMALE:I may not remember what it feels like, but I remember what it looks like.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma, listen
OTHERMALE:You, listen.
LEADMALE:How dare you come here and act like a gigolo? You've embarrassed me, your mother, our friends.
LEADMALE:Not to mention that poor, stupid, flat-chested girl.
LEADMALE:You've broken my heart.
OTHERMALE:I'm ashamed you're my grandson.
LEADMALE:Look what you've done.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you're proud of yourself.
OTHERMALE:Bridget, I am shocked at your behaviour.
SUPFEMALE:Why doesn't everybody just calm down? Bridget and Michael went out, had a great time.
LEADMALE:It was nice.
OTHERMALE:I wouldn't call it great.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, too much wine.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like us to leave so you can try again? Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think we should encourage them.
SUPMALE:Why don't we let them get dressed? Then we can discuss this like rational human beings.
LEADMALE:That's a good idea, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Rose, I meant let them get dressed in private.
SUPMALE:Oh, sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I'm still in shock.
LEADMALE:I've never seen Bridget in bed with a man.
LEADMALE:Except Raggedy Andy.
LEADMALE:I just can't believe it.
LEADMALE:Believe it, Rose.
OTHERMALE:I can't.
LEADMALE:You know when you can't believe something? I can't believe Alan Thicke has a hit series.
SUPFEMALE:That doesn't mean it isn't so.
SUPFEMALE:I blame you for this, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:Why? But for that date, Michael wouldn't have seduced Bridget.
LEADMALE:What? He didn't seduce her.
LEADFEMALE:You were there?
LEADMALE:I happen to know.
LEADMALE:How?
SUPFEMALE:Bridget isn't his type.
SUPMALE:No, she's too good for him.
LEADMALE:How about a nice glass of lemonade?
OTHERFEMALE:Why is she too good for him?
LEADFEMALE:He has no job.
SUPFEMALE:Neither does Henry Kissinger but he's still highly regarded.
LEADMALE:My son is an artist.
LEADFEMALE:A nice way of saying loser.
LEADMALE:My son is not a loser.
LEADFEMALE:He happens to be very talented.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, at taking advantage of poor young girls.
LEADMALE:You agree he does have talent.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, face it, your daughter moves faster than Marcus Allen.
LEADFEMALE:I can't face it.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even know who Marcus Allen is.
SUPFEMALE:Let me put it to you another way.
LEADFEMALE:When are you gonna accept that your daughter is not the goody two-shoes you think?
LEADMALE:What do you mean?
LEADMALE:What would you call a girl who sleeps with a man she's known for one day? A damn good sport.
OTHERMALE:I call her a tramp.
SUPFEMALE:What? You heard me, tramp.
LEADFEMALE:Tramp, tramp, tramp.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, we've always had our differences.
OTHERMALE:But I don't think you've said anything so vicious or so cruel.
SUPMALE:I don't think I can speak to you again.
LEADFEMALE:Go after her.
LEADMALE:I will not.
SUPMALE:I'm not the only one who was cruel.
LEADFEMALE:Morning.
OTHERMALE:I'm not talking to you.
LEADFEMALE:You're still upset with me about last night? No, I'm upset because Crockett and Tubbs are wearing darker colours.
LEADMALE:Good morning.
SUPFEMALE:Why are you dressed like that? I'm introducing my line of tennis wear.
LEADMALE:What do you think? I'm in mourning.
LEADMALE:For whom, Sophia?
LEADMALE:Michael.
OTHERFEMALE:After last night, he doesn't exist.
LEADMALE:Oh, excuse me, I didn't see you.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I guess you're still mad at me, too, huh?
OTHERMALE:That's right.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, girls.
SUPMALE:Nobody could be more upset about last night than I am.
LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to be hospitable.
LEADFEMALE:I sent the kids to the symphony to hear Henry Mancini's tribute to the Pink Panther.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't expect them to jump into bed.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, it's not the end of the world.
LEADMALE:These things do happen.
LEADFEMALE:The same thing happened to me in my early 20s.
LEADFEMALE:I was taking some classes at Miss McGyver's finishing school.
OTHERMALE:One night, Bobby Jo Springer had escorted me back to my dormitory after the annual Fine Manners ball, when an innocent good-night kiss developed into an evening of passion.
LEADFEMALE:But at 3am, the door flung open and there stood Miss McGyver, making one of those bed checks she was famous for.
OTHERMALE:I tried to handle the whole thing like a lady.
SUPFEMALE:I waved politely over Bobby Jo's shoulder with my foot.
LEADFEMALE:She was unmoved.
LEADFEMALE:Next day, she sat me down, lectured me and kicked me out of school.
LEADMALE:Only, I didn't care.
LEADMALE:I knew what ecstasy was.
LEADFEMALE:All she could do was walk around with a dictionary on her head.
LEADFEMALE:Alright, maybe you don't feel like talking to me.
LEADFEMALE:But talk to your children.
LEADFEMALE:Tell them how you feel.
OTHERFEMALE:Only, make sure after it's all over that it's brought you closer together, not further apart.
SUPMALE:Who are you, Mr Spock? I think you mean Dr Spock, Sophia.
OTHERFEMALE:They're both real smart and they've got big ears, so don't get technical, OK? I am speaking from experience, Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:I failed to listen to my children.
SUPFEMALE:You don't see any of them visiting here.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even see my hand in front of my face.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, you're making a lot of sense.
OTHERFEMALE:We were so busy protecting our kids, we fought with each other.
LEADFEMALE:I owe you an apology.
LEADFEMALE:I owe you one.
LEADMALE:No, no, no
LEADFEMALE:Girls, what's the difference? The important thing is, we're all friends again.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you're all friends again, but not me.
SUPMALE:I don't forgive or forget.
SUPMALE:I'm prone to growing moles.
LEADMALE:I'm Italian.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, please, go on.
LEADFEMALE:That's enough.
LEADFEMALE:Let's talk about last night.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, Ma.
LEADMALE:You ungrateful brat, how could you do this to me? I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:That's not what I planned on saying.
SUPMALE:It's OK.
SUPFEMALE:You've every right to be angry.
SUPMALE:I don't understand how you could do this.
LEADFEMALE:It wasn't anything planned.
SUPMALE:The whole thing just kind of happened.
OTHERMALE:Just kind of happened? Michael, dandruff just kind of happens.
LEADFEMALE:Not a thing like this.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't know that, I've failed somewhere.
SUPMALE:Stop torturing yourself.
SUPMALE:None of this is your fault.
LEADMALE:It is.
SUPMALE:Where did I go wrong?
OTHERMALE:You're a great mother.
SUPMALE:If I were, you would be graduating from medical school, not playing doctor with my best friend's daughter here in this house.
LEADMALE:Ma, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:It wasn't the right time and it ended up embarrassing you and your friends.
SUPMALE:I guess I wasn't thinking.
LEADFEMALE:That's your problem, Michael.
LEADMALE:You go through life not thinking.
LEADMALE:You go from town to town, job to job, relationship to relationship.
LEADMALE:Michael, you're 29 years old.
LEADMALE:When will you grow up and accept some responsibility? I'm sorry about what happened.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry I won't be all you hoped I'd be.
LEADFEMALE:The only thing I want you to be is happy.
LEADMALE:I don't want you waking up one morning, sorry for choices you made.
LEADMALE:I appreciate that.
SUPFEMALE:But, Ma, I have to live my own life.
SUPFEMALE:Despite my flaws, I am basically a decent, honest person.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think you could just love me for that? I already do.
LEADMALE:Then you forgive me? Of course I forgive you.
OTHERFEMALE:But if you ever pull a stunt like that again, I am going to throw you out on your flawed but honest behind.
LEADFEMALE:So, did you two make up?
SUPMALE:Yes, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Did you apologise and beg her forgiveness?
SUPMALE:Yes, Grandma.
LEADMALE:OK, now do it to me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I wouldn't hurt you.
SUPMALE:I hope you can forgive me.
LEADFEMALE:That's it?
LEADMALE:I promise to write more often.
SUPMALE:And?
SUPMALE:And call you every week.
LEADMALE:Every week? You think I don't have a social life? You can call me every other week.
LEADMALE:OK, every other week.
OTHERFEMALE:Good, you're forgiven.
LEADFEMALE:Thank God this is over.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't see a thing through this crap.
LEADMALE:I'm all packed and ready to go.
SUPMALE:I'll have your lunch done soon.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, I think we should talk.
LEADMALE:Why don't we forget about it?
LEADMALE:I don't want to.
LEADFEMALE:I forgive you.
LEADFEMALE:I know it wasn't your fault.
LEADFEMALE:Mom.
LEADFEMALE:You've got to stop pretending I'm some perfect angel.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not.
LEADMALE:I make mistakes.
SUPMALE:What I did the other night was one of them.
LEADMALE:I am sorry about embarrassing you and your friends.
LEADFEMALE:But that doesn't change the fact that I slept with Michael.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, I so wanted your first time to be special.
SUPFEMALE:It was, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Four years ago.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I really don't wanna talk about this.
LEADFEMALE:I want us to talk about this.
OTHERFEMALE:I want us to have an open, honest relationship.
LEADMALE:I wanna be able to share my deepest, darkest secrets with you.
SUPMALE:Couldn't we just wear matching outfits? Mother.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, honey, but it's just that Suddenly, it's like you're a whole new person.
LEADFEMALE:It's gonna take a little getting used to.
LEADMALE:I understand.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll miss you very much.
SUPMALE:I'll miss you, too, Mom.
OTHERMALE:You're sure I can't drive you to the airport? No, I'll be fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, Sophia, thank you for having me.
LEADMALE:Don't thank me, thank my grandson.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, gotta go.
SUPMALE:I thought you were staying till the end of the week.
LEADFEMALE:I got a call for a gig in New Orleans.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck to you, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Call me when you get there.
LEADMALE:I will.
SUPMALE:Bye-bye, Grandma.
LEADMALE:Be good, Michael.
SUPMALE:Rose.
OTHERMALE:Wanna share a taxi?
LEADFEMALE:Sounds great.
LEADFEMALE:Make sure that's all you share.
SUPFEMALE:You two have a safe trip.
SUPFEMALE:Bye-bye, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Girls, how do I look?
OTHERFEMALE:Where are you going?
OTHERMALE:On a date.
SUPFEMALE:The doctor said take it easy.
LEADFEMALE:He did, but I'm going stir-crazy.
LEADFEMALE:I have to get out.
LEADFEMALE:Stick to the doctor's orders.
SUPMALE:I think Dorothy's right.
LEADFEMALE:Who knows my body better than I do? Any man in Miami not attached to a woman or a respirator.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:I'll set these down and show you through the house.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't have to wait outside.
LEADMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:It's OK, fella.
LEADMALE:I don't mind if I do.
LEADFEMALE:Nice place you got here.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thank you.
SUPMALE:Can I offer you something? Coffee? Tea? Scraps from last night's dinner? Oh, you're pulling my tail.
LEADMALE:Aren't you a little old for imaginary friends? Sophia, I wasn't talking to myself.
LEADFEMALE:I was talking to the dog.
LEADMALE:My Auntie Bet talked to woodpeckers.
LEADMALE:He's adorable.
SUPFEMALE:I found him at the market.
SUPMALE:I'll keep him till I find his owner.
LEADMALE:Find his owner before Dorothy gets home.
LEADFEMALE:She hates dogs.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, well, look at the cute little puppy dog.
LEADMALE:Hello there, honey.
LEADMALE:He likes me.
LEADMALE:He must be a male.
SUPFEMALE:Then you don't mind if he stays till I find his owner? Mind? Of course I mind.
LEADFEMALE:You can't keep that filthy beast in my house.
SUPMALE:But you said he was cute.
LEADMALE:He is.
SUPFEMALE:But a dog belongs outdoors in his natural habitat where he's free to roam and lick himself in the privacy of his doghouse.
SUPFEMALE:He won't be any trouble.
LEADMALE:I'll keep him in my room.
SUPMALE:You won't know he's here.
LEADFEMALE:OK, but we're not the only ones living here.
LEADMALE:Dorothy has to agree, too.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:If he lifts his leg, I'll rub your nose in it.
OTHERMALE:That seems fair.
OTHERMALE:Bye, Auntie Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, Auntie Sophia.
OTHERFEMALE:She gets away with it.
SUPFEMALE:If she was my age she'd be locked up making boats out of sticks.
LEADFEMALE:I've had it.
OTHERMALE:I've just had it.
OTHERFEMALE:In the past few days I've been turned down for every available part-time job in Dade County that didn't involved selling cocaine.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, it's just so unfair.
LEADFEMALE:They shouldn't do this to a fine teacher like you.
SUPFEMALE:It's part of the experimental year-round school system.
SUPMALE:Every teacher is required to take a ten-week leave and my ten weeks are now.
OTHERMALE:You should've taken the job I suggested.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, you wanted me to be a nun.
SUPFEMALE:It's steady work, they supply the uniform and you're married to God.
LEADMALE:At least he's home every night.
SUPMALE:Maybe it's time you reconsidered working at the museum with me.
SUPMALE:Come on, we've had that conversation.
OTHERMALE:All I know about museums is not to eat the veal in the cafeteria.
LEADFEMALE:You can't find a job and you need the money.
SUPFEMALE:It might be fun working together.
LEADFEMALE:Well
LEADMALE:I won't take no for an answer.
LEADMALE:I'll set up an interview with Mr Allen tomorrow.
SUPMALE:What was that? Rose found a dog at the supermarket.
LEADFEMALE:Couldn't she get stew meat like she usually does? Dorothy, don't be upset.
SUPFEMALE:The poor thing was lost.
LEADMALE:He followed me home.
LEADFEMALE:You drive to the market.
OTHERMALE:Did he follow you in a taxi? He looked so hungry and sad.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't just leave him.
LEADFEMALE:I hunted hours for his owner.
LEADMALE:I hate dogs, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody hates dogs.
LEADMALE:Please, just for the night.
LEADMALE:I promise.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, Auntie Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:I won't be any trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
OTHERMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:But just for the night.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Auntie Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, do you believe this? I saw her lips move.
LEADFEMALE:I took several art courses in college and I've also substituted in art appreciation classes in the public school system.
SUPMALE:Mr Allen, Dorothy was telling you about her background.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, I'm distracted.
SUPMALE:It's not every day you find your friend in bed with your wife.
LEADMALE:I'm so sorry.
LEADMALE:That must have been quite a shock.
LEADMALE:It was.
OTHERMALE:Arthur's never come home at lunch before.
OTHERMALE:He caught me red-handed.
LEADMALE:Now, where were we?
LEADMALE:We were talking about art.
LEADMALE:The thing we hang on the wall here.
LEADFEMALE:What about it?
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy knows a lot about it.
LEADMALE:She studied in Rome and lectured in Paris and she has a very keen eye for colour and light and form.
SUPFEMALE:She's always the first one to compliment me on my wardrobe.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche thinks highly of you.
OTHERMALE:She's taking my résumé to the Vatican this afternoon.
LEADMALE:Pardon? That's just a little joke to ease the tension of the moment.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:I tried to think of something funny to say when Art walked in.
SUPMALE:But standing there in my shorts, nothing came to mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mr Allen.
LEADMALE:Does Dorothy get the job?
LEADMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:I don't care.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Mr Allen.
LEADMALE:I hope I live up to your expectations.
LEADMALE:Come on, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:That's a boy.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, why are you up so early? Never mind.
LEADFEMALE:It's over a week.
SUPMALE:Why is that mutt still here? I promised to take him to the pound, but he wasn't well.
SUPMALE:I'm a little worried.
LEADMALE:Don't be, it was a hangover.
LEADFEMALE:What?
SUPFEMALE:A hangover from the sherry.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, you gave the dog sherry? That's terrible.
OTHERFEMALE:I was having a few sips while I rinsed out my underwear.
LEADFEMALE:It's a little thing I do Mondays and Thursdays.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, the dog walks in, looks at me, and it's your Uncle Aldo's face begging for a drink.
LEADMALE:I give him a swallow, but he doesn't know when to stop, also like Aldo.
LEADMALE:We sing some Puccini, stretch out on the couch and take a nap.
OTHERMALE:All in all, a pleasant afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, the dog is drooling on my foot.
LEADMALE:You say that like it's a bad thing.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, we had an agreement.
LEADFEMALE:You said the dog would be gone by now.
SUPMALE:Just one more day, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:I'll find the owner.
OTHERFEMALE:I have posters all over the neighbourhood.
OTHERMALE:One more day or I'll get rid of the dog myself.
LEADMALE:I'll take him out to the lanai.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Auntie Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Lighten up.
LEADMALE:Morning.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, Auntie Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:The pup's still here.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:One more day, unless Ma takes him bar hopping.
LEADMALE:How come you're dressed so early? I told Mr Allen I'd come in early to get the press list information ready before lunch.
LEADFEMALE:You're such a treasure.
LEADFEMALE:I hope he appreciates you.
LEADFEMALE:After only a week you know as much about that museum as I do.
SUPFEMALE:What's to know? Bang in a nail, hang a picture.
LEADMALE:Any idiot could do that.
LEADFEMALE:Stop bragging.
SUPMALE:You're only saying that cos I'm your daughter.
SUPFEMALE:I'm very proud of the job you're doing, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Hello? Just a minute.
SUPMALE:Mr Allen on the phone.
OTHERMALE:He's never called me at home before.
SUPFEMALE:And he's not now.
LEADFEMALE:It's for Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Good morning, Mr Allen.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thank you very much.
OTHERFEMALE:Very sweet of you to call.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Thank you so much.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll see you later.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:What did he want?
LEADMALE:To thank me for my work on the Hotchkiss project.
SUPFEMALE:That's lovely.
OTHERFEMALE:Just lovely.
OTHERMALE:Especially since there wasn't that much work involved.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, it's 8 a.
LEADMALE:m.
LEADMALE:What are you doing with the sherry? I'm not gonna drink it.
LEADMALE:I was hiding it from the dog.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you expect me to believe that? Promise me you won't drive.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, look who I found.
SUPFEMALE:Ma.
LEADMALE:What are you doing here?
SUPFEMALE:You left your lunch at home.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE:You didn't have to come.
SUPMALE:Good excuse to put my teeth in.
OTHERMALE:While you're here, would you like a tour? No.
SUPFEMALE:If I want to look at pictures, I go to FotoMatt.
SUPFEMALE:Rose brought me.
LEADFEMALE:She's outside with the dog.
OTHERFEMALE:You ever stick your head out of a car window doing 50? What a rush.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:And who do we have here? This is my mother Sophia Petrillo.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, this is my boss Mr Allen.
SUPFEMALE:Pleased to meet you, Mrs Petrillo.
SUPMALE:What brings you to our humble home? Is he gay? Come on, I'll walk you to the car.
SUPMALE:Goodbye.
LEADMALE:Sorry you didn't have an opportunity to experience our museum.
SUPFEMALE:I'd love for you to see my most prized acquisition.
OTHERFEMALE:A magnificent pair of Gauguins.
SUPMALE:What are you, a pervert? I was married 45 years.
SUPFEMALE:I never even saw my husband's Gauguins.
SUPMALE:I forgot why I came to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:About the banquet.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you worry about a thing.
SUPMALE:I love to throw a party.
LEADMALE:Leave it to me.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, I've decided to leave everything to Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me?
SUPFEMALE:I've put Dorothy in charge of the arrangements for the banquet.
OTHERFEMALE:You won't have to do a thing.
LEADMALE:You'll have your time free to devote to the exhibition.
LEADFEMALE:But, Mr Allen, I'd always assumed that I was gonna handle it.
LEADFEMALE:You were, but that was before we found Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Tell her I want to see her.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy isn't here.
LEADFEMALE:She was arrested on a morals charge this morning.
LEADFEMALE:You never know, do you? Have a nice day.
LEADMALE:Ma, gimme a break.
SUPFEMALE:The Di-Gel's on the bottom shelf.
LEADFEMALE:You.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:That does it.
SUPMALE:Come on, out.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Out.
OTHERMALE:Move it.
LEADMALE:Out.
SUPMALE:Right now.
LEADMALE:Come on, now, this isn't fair.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:I'm not falling for those big sad eyes and floppy ears and wet nose.
SUPFEMALE:The last time I did, it ended in divorce.
LEADFEMALE:Stan couldn't even catch a Frisbee in his teeth.
LEADMALE:Listen.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, it's not a personal thing.
SUPMALE:I don't hate you.
LEADMALE:As a matter of fact, I once had a dog.
LEADFEMALE:A schnauzer name Wa-Wa.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, well, I know that sounds strange, but my daughter was only two when she named him during a walk.
LEADMALE:And I figured between that and Number One, Wa-Wa was the hands-down winner.
SUPFEMALE:He was the greatest dog in the world.
LEADMALE:Present company excluded.
SUPFEMALE:I loved that dog.
LEADFEMALE:He was always with me.
LEADMALE:I thought I'd never be able to get along without him.
LEADFEMALE:And one day he died.
LEADMALE:I cried for a week.
SUPFEMALE:And I decided then I would never ever go through that again.
LEADFEMALE:So, you see, it's not My God.
SUPFEMALE:I've spilled my guts to someone who drinks out of a toilet.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I'm sorry, you are out of here.
OTHERFEMALE:One Wa-Wa in my life was enough.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I've had it with that disgusting dog.
LEADFEMALE:I've tolerated him as long as I can.
SUPFEMALE:He's got to go.
LEADFEMALE:But, Dorothy
SUPMALE:No "buts", Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:OK, I'll need a few more days.
LEADMALE:A few more days and that is it.
LEADMALE:Get me a doggie bone.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I don't think you deserve one.
LEADFEMALE:Not for me.
LEADMALE:It's to lure that mutt out of my room.
OTHERMALE:That's OK.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get him out.
OTHERMALE:Aunt Dorothy's certainly a grouch.
SUPFEMALE:You couldn't sleep either, huh? No, I guess it's the knife in my back.
OTHERMALE:Come again? I wasn't going to mention this, but I won't be able to sleep until I do.
SUPMALE:You have backed me into a corner.
LEADFEMALE:When that happens, I come out fighting like a wild cat.
OTHERMALE:Unless I'm drunk.
LEADFEMALE:I slide down the wall and make passionate love on the carpet.
SUPMALE:Blanche, what the hell are you talking about? You stole the banquet of the only art show I've ever put together.
LEADFEMALE:I did not steal your banquet.
SUPMALE:Mr Allen assigned it to me.
OTHERMALE:Why? Why give it to you and not to me? I've been working there for five years.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the one who's been wearing low-cut blouses and picking up pencils off the floor.
LEADMALE:I'm the one he always gropes at the Christmas party.
LEADMALE:And they picked Sandra Day O'Connor over you? I'm not taking this sitting down.
SUPFEMALE:When it comes to art, you cannot hold a candle to me.
OTHERMALE:Give me back my banquet before you mess it up.
SUPMALE:Listen, Mr Allen gave me that banquet and I'll take charge of it, regardless of your childish insecurities.
LEADMALE:Who are you calling childish?
LEADFEMALE:Who did you call back-stabber? Girls, this little fella better stick around a while.
LEADFEMALE:Get rid of him.
OTHERMALE:He's ill.
OTHERMALE:Who cares? Don't explain, Rose.
SUPMALE:I lived with some bitches myself.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, is Blanche around?
OTHERFEMALE:She hasn't come in yet.
SUPMALE:Good, we can talk about the banquet.
LEADFEMALE:How's everything going?
SUPFEMALE:She doesn't suspect a thing.
LEADMALE:I can't wait to see her face when she sees the banquet is to honour her good work.
LEADFEMALE:I can't either.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll finish my speech for Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:When it's done, would you look at it? I'd be happy to, Mr Allen.
LEADFEMALE:Be happy to, Mr Allen.
LEADFEMALE:My, aren't we licking boots a little early? I had a light breakfast.
SUPFEMALE:Here's your mail.
OTHERFEMALE:Why not tell me what's in it? What? Haven't you already steamed it open? Please, I have a lot of work to get done before lunch.
SUPFEMALE:Don't let little ineffectual, insignificant me
LEADFEMALE:get between you and your work.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't want to come between your lips and Mr Allen's behind.
LEADMALE:Blanche, that does it, I have had it.
OTHERMALE:Up until we started working together, you were my best friend.
OTHERMALE:We were good friends because you trusted me.
LEADMALE:Now you think I'm some other person, someone who'd stab you in the back.
SUPFEMALE:I am not that person.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, I am still your best friend, whether or not you think so.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, I I've been acting like such a fool.
LEADMALE:I don't know what in the hell got into me.
OTHERFEMALE:I know you'd never hide anything behind my back.
LEADFEMALE:Please forgive me, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Please, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Please.
SUPMALE:You really hurt my feelings.
SUPFEMALE:I I don't know.
SUPMALE:Please.
OTHERFEMALE:This is tearing me up.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a mess.
LEADFEMALE:You can't tell from the way I look, but it's true.
LEADFEMALE:OK, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I forgive you.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I've got the thing I want you to look over.
SUPFEMALE:The thing.
LEADMALE:I'll look at it later.
SUPFEMALE:So, where would you like to have lunch? How about that new pizza place on the corner?
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes? What was that thing Mr Allen just gave you?
OTHERMALE:What thing?
LEADFEMALE:That thing in your drawer.
LEADMALE:That thing.
LEADMALE:It's nothing.
SUPFEMALE:If it's nothing, let me see it.
LEADMALE:I am really hungry.
SUPMALE:Let's go out and get that pizza now.
LEADFEMALE:It's 9.
SUPMALE:15.
LEADMALE:I don't want pizza, I want to see that.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry, Blanche, you can't.
LEADMALE:Why?
LEADMALE:Because.
OTHERMALE:Why? Because it's none of your business.
LEADFEMALE:None of my business? I will have you know that before you came here, everything was my business.
LEADFEMALE:Show me that paper.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, Blanche, I can't.
LEADMALE:I knew you'd been hiding something.
OTHERFEMALE:You no-good, back-stabbing jezebel.
LEADMALE:I demand you show me that paper.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, flattery won't work.
SUPMALE:I'll tell you what won't work.
SUPFEMALE:You and me in the same office.
SUPMALE:Stealing that banquet was bad enough, but hiding things is going too far.
LEADMALE:If you want this job that bad that you have to lie, you can have it.
LEADMALE:I quit.
OTHERFEMALE:Gin.
LEADMALE:Aren't you gonna get mad?
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:Want to play again? Nah.
OTHERMALE:If you don't get mad, it's no fun.
SUPFEMALE:You still upset about Blanche?
LEADMALE:Yes, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Tell her that cockamamie banquet is for her.
LEADFEMALE:I can't, I was sworn to secrecy.
SUPMALE:Hi, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Eat dirt and die, trash.
SUPFEMALE:Just hold it right there, Blanche.
SUPMALE:You stay out of this, Ma.
LEADMALE:That banquet you're mad about is in your honour.
LEADFEMALE:What?
LEADFEMALE:I told you, it was a secret.
LEADMALE:Your secret, not mine.
SUPFEMALE:Is this true?
SUPMALE:Yes, it is.
LEADMALE:Now you feel like the dirt you wanted her to eat, I think I'll have a hard candy.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I I don't know what to say.
LEADMALE:I understand, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, you don't.
SUPMALE:See, I thought I was a miracle worker, that nobody could do what I do at the museum.
OTHERMALE:Then you came and learned my job in a week and I realised any idiot can do it.
LEADFEMALE:And you were afraid you couldn't find the right words to apologise.
LEADFEMALE:There are no right words, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Words cannot begin to ease the pain I've inflicted on you.
OTHERMALE:But I want to make it up to you.
LEADMALE:I want to give you something personal, something from the heart.
LEADMALE:The most beautiful thing I own, to the most beautiful person I know.
LEADFEMALE:I guess that would be my emerald earrings.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure as hell not gonna give you those.
LEADFEMALE:But I want to give you something.
LEADFEMALE:Something personal.
LEADMALE:I know, how about a personal cheque for $ 75? On the bottom I'll write, "I was a big fat jerk.
LEADMALE:" Blanche, I don't want your cheque I am trying to find some way to tell you I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:OK, I'll take it but I won't cash it.
LEADMALE:I'll keep it as a reminder for the next time you behave like a big fat jerk.
LEADFEMALE:OK.
LEADFEMALE:Will you be able to pretend to be surprised at that banquet? Of course.
OTHERMALE:I've pretended to be a virgin enough times.
SUPFEMALE:Girls, I've got great news.
SUPFEMALE:I found the dog's owner.
SUPMALE:How did you know? He recognised the picture.
SUPMALE:And the dog came to him when he called.
SUPFEMALE:That's wonderful.
SUPMALE:I'm so glad he found his owner.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, why, are you crying? No, I just have something in my eye.
LEADFEMALE:That's dog love in your eyes.
LEADMALE:All right, I admit it.
SUPFEMALE:I love dogs.
LEADMALE:It just breaks my heart that that dog is gone.
LEADMALE:I felt the same when I dropped him off.
SUPMALE:That's why I stopped at the animal shelter.
LEADMALE:Come on in, guys.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, guys.
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Sophia, isn't that obscene? No.
LEADMALE:They mean, "good health," "have a nice day" and "would you like to squeeze my concertina?" You spent the afternoon together.
SUPMALE:He didn't ask you out? What did you do wrong?
LEADMALE:Who didn't ask you out?
LEADMALE:You got a phone book? Frank Leahy, the teacher I've been working with on the youth fair.
LEADFEMALE:Two weeks and he hasn't asked her out yet.
SUPMALE:I don't know him know him.
LEADMALE:We have spent exactly two Saturday mornings building display booths and painting signs.
LEADMALE:We're hardly close.
LEADFEMALE:You could be, if you'd ask him out.
OTHERMALE:He's too shy to ask you.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe he just doesn't like her.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Rose.
SUPMALE:Incidentally, you look fat.
LEADMALE:The time for subtlety has passed.
LEADMALE:If you want this man, ask him out.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I feel so awkward asking a man out on a date.
OTHERFEMALE:You could invite him here to dinner, wouldn't seem as pushy.
LEADFEMALE:Great idea, then we can all check him out.
LEADMALE:I don't think I can do it.
LEADMALE:Of course you can.
LEADFEMALE:You be Frank.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be you.
LEADFEMALE:OK? Why, Frank, you know I've been thinking, this is our third Saturday and I don't even know what you like to eat.
SUPFEMALE:Come over for dinner this Saturday night and let me find out what whets your appetite.
SUPFEMALE:And what are you serving for dessert, Blanche, penicillin? I'll do it my own way.
LEADFEMALE:If you do, you'd better use Jane Fonda's body, otherwise, it'll be just four of us for dinner.
SUPMALE:Frank Frank, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I was just going to say that the sign seemed a little high on one side.
LEADFEMALE:How about a coffee break?
OTHERFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:When you get the chance, would you fix that sign? Seems a little high on one side.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, sure, Frank.
LEADFEMALE:I notice a lot of your students call you "Frank.
LEADMALE:"
LEADFEMALE:You don't approve?
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADMALE:On the contrary.
LEADFEMALE:Anything other than "Yo, Teach.
OTHERFEMALE:" Is an educational breakthrough.
SUPMALE:Formal titles can be very intimidating.
SUPFEMALE:This way, I'm just one of the guys.
LEADFEMALE:You think a lot of these kids.
LEADFEMALE:So do you.
LEADFEMALE:I do, but I sense a special dedication from you.
OTHERFEMALE:It's nice.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I've been at this a long time.
SUPFEMALE:I know their families, been to their homes for dinner.
SUPFEMALE:Really? You've been to their homes for dinner? They spread a newspaper on the floor for me.
LEADMALE:I'm kidding.
SUPMALE:You seem so amazed.
LEADMALE:I'm not amazed.
LEADMALE:I just think it's nice that you do that.
SUPMALE:I just assumed that you knew that I ate dinner.
LEADFEMALE:It's nice that you go to people's homes for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:How would you like to go home with me? I mean, for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Next week? My roommates would love to meet you.
SUPFEMALE:What's a good night?
LEADMALE:Bingo night.
LEADMALE:Or I'd have to introduce you to my mother.
OTHERMALE:But the table looked fine, right where we always keep it.
LEADFEMALE:But with her complexion, those yellow garden lights make Dorothy look like Eric Severeid.
SUPFEMALE:Look out, St Dominic's.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia feels lucky tonight.
LEADMALE:Tonight's the big bingo game, isn't it? The biggest.
LEADFEMALE:I got my lucky handkerchief.
LEADFEMALE:I can't lose.
SUPMALE:Where did you find it?
LEADMALE:In my bra.
LEADFEMALE:In your bra? What was your lucky handkerchief doing in there? I was blowing my breasts, Rose.
LEADMALE:To give me cleavage, to turn on the butcher to get a decent piece of veal.
SUPMALE:Now, if you'll excuse me, there's an electric weed whacker with my name on it.
LEADMALE:When we go out there for dinner, sit on the far side and I'll sit next to you.
LEADMALE:Why?
SUPMALE:In case anyone wants to play footsie.
OTHERFEMALE:That sounds like fun.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't played footsie in years.
SUPMALE:Charlie never
LEADFEMALE:Rose.
LEADMALE:Frank and Dorothy might play footsie.
SUPFEMALE:How do I look?
LEADFEMALE:Beautiful.
LEADMALE:Go back and change.
SUPFEMALE:That might be alright for a gay funeral in New Orleans, but it's too it's much too subtle for this evening.
LEADFEMALE:Put on something flashy.
LEADMALE:Flashy.
LEADFEMALE:Something colourful.
SUPFEMALE:That's really not me, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I know, honey, but take a chance.
OTHERMALE:Be a woman.
LEADFEMALE:It's an awful lot to ask, but I'll try.
LEADFEMALE:Go.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go see about supper.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you think you might be pushing Dorothy a little hard? No, and I need all your help.
SUPMALE:She needs your help, too.
SUPFEMALE:She won't have too many chances.
SUPFEMALE:She doesn't have my beauty or your We'll help you next week.
OTHERMALE:The point is she glows every time she speaks his name.
LEADMALE:Do you think Dorothy's in love? She's very definitely smitten.
OTHERFEMALE:With help from us, she can fire Cupid's arrow into the tushie of love.
LEADFEMALE:The "tushie of love"? For some strange reason, I find that provocative.
LEADFEMALE:You really ought to date more, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:That must be him.
LEADFEMALE:Heat up the rolls and cool yourself down.
OTHERMALE:Good evening.
LEADMALE:Good evening, Father.
SUPFEMALE:This must be an important cause.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you usually make the nuns ask for money? I'll get my purse.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Frank.
SUPFEMALE:I'm here to see Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:You're the hunk? I mean Forgive me, Father.
SUPMALE:That is, forgive my language, not in your official capacity.
LEADMALE:I'm not even a Catholic.
LEADMALE:I'm a Baptist and you can't forgive us Baptists.
LEADFEMALE:Sweet Jesus, why am I babbling? I meant that in all due reverence.
LEADMALE:I never take the Lord's name in vain.
LEADMALE:God.
LEADMALE:Now I'm lying to a priest.
LEADMALE:Why don't you come on in and sit down.
LEADMALE:I'm Blanche.
SUPMALE:Would you get the door? Dorothy's told me a great deal about you.
LEADMALE:Well, she left out one itty-bitty detail about you.
LEADFEMALE:That I'm a priest? She didn't know.
LEADMALE:What'd she think? You were just a boring dresser? She's just never seen me in cleric's clothing.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know you priests could take your clothes off.
SUPFEMALE:We do a lot of things real people do.
LEADFEMALE:Except for one very important thing.
LEADMALE:Boy, is that gonna put a hitch in Dorothy's plans.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Rose Nylund.
OTHERFEMALE:You must be Frank.
OTHERMALE:It's a pleasure to meet you.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Nice to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy's talked about you for weeks.
SUPFEMALE:Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:Every time she mentions your name, she glows.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I think she's very smitten.
LEADMALE:Rose.
LEADMALE:He's a priest, isn't he?
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Rose.
LEADMALE:I'm so sorry Hell Town was cancelled.
LEADMALE:Frank, I'm sorry I Please tell me that's a Nehru jacket.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's not.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, let's go heat up the lasagne.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't you tell me it was Father Leahy?
LEADFEMALE:I assumed you knew.
LEADMALE:No, I didn't.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, frankly, I'm
LEADMALE:I'm a little embarrassed.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
SUPMALE:We can still be friends, can't we? Of course we can.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you're here.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, so am I.
LEADFEMALE:You look lovely tonight.
SUPMALE:I look like the mother of a Solid Gold dancer.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I'm sorry about this misunderstanding.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:It's alright.
SUPFEMALE:OK, everybody, we're ready to serve the appetisers.
LEADMALE:Come on, Frank.
SUPFEMALE:We're eating out on the lanai.
OTHERMALE:Now, where am I supposed to sit? Where you damn well please.
LEADFEMALE:What difference does it make? Go.
LEADMALE:So first you were a teacher and then you became a priest.
LEADFEMALE:First, I went to medical school for a year.
SUPFEMALE:Then I quit and became an assistant basketball coach, then a teacher, then came the priesthood.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think you'll do next? Anybody care for more coffee? I have another pot brewing.
OTHERMALE:Let me give you a hand.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:You know, black is your colour.
LEADFEMALE:Did that influence your decision to enter the priesthood? It wasn't the evening I'd planned, but it's turned out to be pleasant enough.
LEADMALE:Frank is a very special person, isn't he? Yes, he is and he obviously thinks the same about you.
OTHERMALE:Of course he does.
LEADMALE:We're friends.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, I hesitate to say this, but Something in Frank's eyes says he thinks of you as more than a friend.
LEADMALE:Blanche, the man is a priest.
LEADMALE:The man's a man.
SUPMALE:I'm not listening to this.
LEADMALE:I was in a similar situation once.
LEADFEMALE:He was a man of the cloth.
LEADMALE:Totally dedicated to his vocation or so he said, but his eyes told me he was dedicated to me.
LEADFEMALE:We both knew it was wrong and we fought our feelings with every bone in our hot, longing, writhing bodies.
LEADMALE:It was just too much for us and we checked into a Best Western.
SUPMALE:You had an affair with a priest? I said, "a man of the cloth.
LEADMALE:" He was a fabric salesman.
LEADFEMALE:We never made love again, but he did cover my La-Z-Boy for free.
LEADFEMALE:Wonderful, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Something in his eyes says he wants you, in the biblical sense.
OTHERMALE:I will not listen to this.
LEADFEMALE:The coffee's ready.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, the bingo game's over already? It wasn't a game.
SUPFEMALE:It was a travesty.
SUPMALE:They call four lousy numbers and, boom, Gloria's a winner.
SUPMALE:Six more numbers, Kessler's jumping up and down, shouting, "I'm rich.
OTHERFEMALE:" Of course she also does this on the boardwalk to attract men.
OTHERFEMALE:I think the whole thing was fixed.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I'm gonna ask Hugh Downs to investigate.
SUPMALE:I guess they sent you over to shut me up.
LEADMALE:Ma, this is Father Leahy.
SUPFEMALE:He had dinner with us tonight.
LEADMALE:Pleased to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:What happened to your date? Father Leahy is her date.
OTHERFEMALE:Come here.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, sometimes a mother gets a little busy and forgets to tell her daughter everything she needs to know.
OTHERMALE:So I'm telling you now.
OTHERMALE:Don't date a priest.
SUPFEMALE:It's bad luck.
LEADMALE:Ma
SUPMALE:Trust me on this one.
SUPMALE:What happened to me at bingo tonight was no accident.
LEADMALE:I didn't realise how late it was.
LEADMALE:I should be going.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, all.
LEADFEMALE:I had a wonderful time.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you on Saturday at the youth fair.
LEADMALE:Dinner before then? Something I want to talk about.
SUPMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:What is it? Thanks to you, I'm on the verge of making an important decision.
LEADFEMALE:I'm thinking of leaving the Church.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I heard you up.
SUPMALE:I couldn't sleep.
SUPFEMALE:I had a horrible nightmare.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell it to me.
LEADMALE:I'm awful good at interpreting dreams.
SUPMALE:I was a contestant on The Dating Game and I won.
LEADMALE:I went to meet the bachelor who picked me and it was the Pope.
SUPMALE:That is a tough one.
SUPFEMALE:Where did you go on the date? Forget it, forget it.
OTHERMALE:Good night, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? I thought you were asleep.
LEADMALE:Provisions.
SUPFEMALE:I figured we'd be up all night talking.
LEADMALE:I'm going.
SUPMALE:She don't feel like talking.
LEADFEMALE:But I got chocolate macadamia-nut cheesecake and rum-raisin ice cream.
LEADFEMALE:Alright.
LEADMALE:Start cutting.
SUPFEMALE:You scoop.
LEADFEMALE:That's my girl.
LEADFEMALE:Did you decide what you're gonna do? No.
SUPFEMALE:My luck.
LEADMALE:The first really wonderful guy I've met in a long time and he turns out to have a more serious involvement.
SUPFEMALE:With whom?
SUPMALE:Pam Dawber.
SUPFEMALE:The Church.
LEADMALE:Or he did until he met me.
OTHERMALE:Take the religious aspect out of this and it's romantic.
LEADMALE:Giving up everything for the woman he loves, like the Duke of Windsor.
LEADFEMALE:Or the story of Rose and Charlie Nylund.
LEADMALE:When I think of one, I automatically think of the other.
LEADFEMALE:When Charlie and I started dating, I felt his folks didn't like me.
LEADMALE:That's when I decided to get to the bottom of things and the ancient feud between the Nylunds and the Gorkleknabygens.
SUPMALE:That was my mother's maiden name.
SUPMALE:Gorkleknabygen? Originally, it was Gorkleknabygen-Höffstädlerfeil.
SUPFEMALE:But they shortened it.
LEADFEMALE:Most of my mother's family were in show business.
SUPMALE:Anyway, when Charlie told them we were gonna get married, they forbade it.
OTHERFEMALE:They said they'd disown him if he married
LEADMALE:A Gorkleknabygen.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:He'd lose his share of the family tile grout fortune.
LEADMALE:He didn't care.
SUPFEMALE:He told them he loved me more than grout.
SUPMALE:Must have been a tough choice for old Charlie.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I heard voices.
SUPMALE:Only two of them are God-fearing.
SUPMALE:Ma, get off my back.
LEADMALE:I feel bad enough.
LEADMALE:What about me? even when the Pope said I didn't have to.
LEADMALE:I go to Mass, I light candles, and for what? To be flushed down the toilet, because my daughter dates Father Happy Pants.
SUPMALE:Ma, you're not making it any easier.
LEADMALE:Look, Dorothy, in the end, only you can decide what's right for you.
SUPFEMALE:Whatever decision it is, I'll stand by you.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Ma.
SUPMALE:Just remember, make the wrong decision, you'll burn in hell forever.
LEADFEMALE:Sleep tight, pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not here to confess, I did that a day ago.
SUPFEMALE:At my age, how much can I sin? I had an impure thought? I'd kill to have an impure thought.
SUPMALE:That would be two sins.
LEADFEMALE:But now I'm telling you your business.
SUPMALE:Let me get to the real point.
LEADFEMALE:It's about you and my daughter.
SUPFEMALE:I know everything and, frankly, I'm not thrilled.
LEADFEMALE:If you wanna leave the priesthood, that's between you and the Vatican, but you should know about Dorothy, before you get carried away.
LEADMALE:So, Frank, have you made your decision? I can serve the Church better as a teaching priest at St Helen's, instead of a parish priest here.
LEADMALE:We're gonna miss you around here.
LEADMALE:Look, I know priests are men and they have urges.
OTHERMALE:What is it, lust? It'll pass.
SUPMALE:I do without.
OTHERFEMALE:You get used to it.
SUPMALE:Get cable TV.
LEADFEMALE:Lots of luck.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE:Frank.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy?
OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing here?
SUPMALE:Free time between classes.
LEADMALE:So you drove 18 miles across town? OK.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted to talk to you.
SUPMALE:I didn't want to wait.
LEADMALE:The thought that I might be responsible for the decision you're making is too much.
LEADFEMALE:This is crazy.
SUPFEMALE:It's not like you pushed me towards this decision.
OTHERMALE:You didn't know I was thinking about it.
LEADMALE:Blanche did.
LEADFEMALE:She saw it in your eyes.
SUPFEMALE:My eyes?
OTHERFEMALE:You're a very special person.
SUPFEMALE:I knew the moment I met you and you felt the same about me.
LEADFEMALE:I can't tell you how flattering that is.
OTHERMALE:I mean, at this stage of a woman's life, to have someone instantly feel that spark for her is a dream come true.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe in the dream he wouldn't be a priest, but that doesn't make it any the less flattering, but it does make it a lot more complicated.
LEADFEMALE:So, Frank, you cannot go through with this.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:It's a mistake that we would both regret for the rest of our lives.
LEADMALE:No matter how strongly you feel, I cannot let you leave the priesthood for me.
OTHERMALE:What? I understand how hurt you must feel.
SUPMALE:Alright, maybe I don't understand exactly.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Dorothy, but our relationship seems to be one misunderstanding after another.
LEADMALE:Misunderstanding? I'm not leaving the priesthood.
SUPMALE:I'm leaving the Church, this church.
SUPMALE:But Well If you're not leaving the priesthood, then I just made a complete ass of myself.
LEADMALE:Excuse my language, Father, but, as an English teacher, I can tell you that's the most appropriate description.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's not.
LEADFEMALE:How can you say that? I created an entire relationship in my imagination.
LEADMALE:It wasn't in your imagination.
SUPMALE:There is something special between us.
OTHERFEMALE:We appreciate each other.
LEADMALE:You could help me see where I could do most good, as a teaching priest.
LEADMALE:It's taken me a little while, but I think I've got it.
SUPFEMALE:Alright.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, your silence is deafening.
SUPMALE:I didn't wanna whip this one out, but I have no choice.
LEADMALE:She's been divorced.
LEADFEMALE:You know the rulebook.
OTHERMALE:We're talking eternity here.
SUPFEMALE:Are we still on for dinner Thursday night? Yes.
LEADMALE:Just so there won't be another misunderstanding, who is buying?
LEADMALE:How about a Dutch treat?
OTHERFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:See you Thursday.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, thanks.
LEADMALE:It's like you didn't hear a word I said! 
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:This has been the NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw.
LEADMALE:Please stay tuned for our next program in progress.
SUPMALE:Gosh.
LEADFEMALE:Wasn't that story about the heart transplant amazing? I wasn't paying attention.
LEADMALE:I was fantasising what Tom Brokaw looks like naked.
OTHERMALE:He must have sensed it.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I saw him looking down your blouse.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Tony.
SUPMALE:We won the dance contest at the Sons Of Italy bar.
LEADFEMALE:That's fantastic.
LEADFEMALE:I had no idea you were such a dancer.
LEADMALE:In the over-80s we were the only couple to do the mambo without a walker.
SUPFEMALE:Don't believe her.
LEADFEMALE:She has great moves.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you tomorrow.
LEADMALE:OK, Tony, take care.
SUPMALE:Give me a break, would you? Bye.
LEADFEMALE:You really like Tony a lot.
SUPMALE:He's the best catch in town.
OTHERMALE:He's got his own hair, his own teeth and a totally unrestricted driver's license.
LEADMALE:At my age, that's like dating Tom Cruise.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Rose.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Rose? Yes, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that a chicken you're carrying in that cage?
LEADFEMALE:I think it is.
SUPMALE:See you.
LEADMALE:Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Before you all say no
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:Please, just hear me out.
LEADMALE:You've heard me speak about Sylvia Butell.
SUPMALE:This is her chicken.
SUPFEMALE:Sylvia Butell? Isn't she the woman who thought Milton Berle was sending her secret messages through her dentures? Yes, but with extensive counselling and some new bridgework, she's totally back to normal.
LEADMALE:The woman keeps a chicken in her house.
LEADFEMALE:How normal can she be?
SUPFEMALE:I kept a chicken in my home.
LEADFEMALE:You see my point? I will not have that filthy beast in my house.
LEADMALE:It belongs in a barnyard.
LEADMALE:This is not a farm chicken.
OTHERFEMALE:Count Bessie is a showbiz chicken.
LEADFEMALE:Wait till you see this.
LEADMALE:A showbiz chicken? What does she do, play the piano? She plays the piano.
SUPFEMALE:You just wait until you see this.
OTHERMALE:OK, honey, come on, it's showtime.
LEADMALE:Yeah, come on, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:OK, Count, hit it.
LEADMALE:Isn't she incredible? What do you say, girls? Can she stay?
OTHERMALE:I guess so.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Just be sure and keep her in her cage.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I can convince the Count to give us some live entertainment with dessert.
LEADFEMALE:Have you any requests? How about Bye Bye Birdie? Sometimes I get confused.
LEADFEMALE:I want to make sure I have this absolutely right.
LEADMALE:Rose works somewhere where they help people with mental problems?
SUPFEMALE:That's right, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Can we contact Morley Safer? I wonder who that could be.
LEADMALE:Maybe it's the Count's clarinet player Henny Goodman.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt Angela.
LEADMALE:No, Sophia Loren.
LEADFEMALE:I stopped using Oil of Olay.
LEADMALE:Angela.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Hello there.
LEADMALE:What's wrong?
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:You travelled 5,000 miles from Sicily for nothing? I know.
LEADFEMALE:The Valducci-Petrillo vendetta is still on.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, buy a dozen mattresses, and some aluminium foil for the windows.
LEADMALE:There is no vendetta.
LEADFEMALE:There's not even a Valducci family anymore.
LEADMALE:They ate some sausages that they shouldn't have at their last family picnic and they all died.
OTHERMALE:Food poisoning? No, they stole the sausage from the Calabresi family.
SUPFEMALE:So, what are you doing here? I took a vacation to come and see you.
LEADMALE:Didn't you get my letter?
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:We never got a letter.
SUPFEMALE:She never sent it.
SUPFEMALE:She forgets.
LEADMALE:I don't forget anything.
LEADMALE:Hi, Angela.
LEADMALE:Hi, Blanche.
LEADMALE:No, I'm Blanche.
SUPMALE:Isn't that confusing, having two Blanches in the same house? Wouldn't you like to lie down? You've had a long trip.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:I just got here.
OTHERMALE:I always get tired after a long trip.
LEADFEMALE:I remember one time Daddy took the whole family cross state on our tractor to visit Great-grandfather Zingbarten.
SUPFEMALE:Great-grandpa Ziggy was a famous inventor.
LEADMALE:He developed the first, and to my knowledge, the only, low-voltage meter to detect what kind of centre pieces of candy had.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, we were just a few miles out You know, I am a little tired.
LEADMALE:I think I will lie down.
SUPMALE:I'm tired myself.
SUPFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:I'm exhausted.
LEADMALE:Fine, but I'm warning you all right now, I'm telling the rest of that story as soon as you get up.
LEADFEMALE:That was the best meal I've ever had.
LEADFEMALE:You left half of it.
LEADMALE:I ate every bite.
LEADMALE:There's some sauce left.
SUPFEMALE:If you really like it, you'll use bread to sop it all up.
LEADFEMALE:You can afford it.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I've put on a few pounds.
LEADFEMALE:You haven't noticed.
LEADFEMALE:Am I blind? I can see that.
SUPMALE:I meant the bread.
LEADFEMALE:You can afford the bread.
SUPFEMALE:It's only 89 cents a loaf.
OTHERFEMALE:Angela, sit down.
LEADMALE:I'll serve dessert.
LEADFEMALE:You two made such a fantastic meal, I can't imagine what dessert could be.
LEADFEMALE:I made dessert.
SUPMALE:Damn.
OTHERMALE:What'd you say, Blanche? Yum, I said yum.
LEADMALE:Rose, is this another one of those Scandinavian Viking concoctions? Yes.
LEADMALE:It's called gnurchen-frurgen cake.
LEADFEMALE:It's an ancient recipe, but I Americanised it.
LEADFEMALE:One might say you brought geflirchen-nirchen into the '80s? Yes, but I'm not one to blow my own verturgen-furgen.
LEADFEMALE:I can't even reach mine.
SUPMALE:Have you had a chance to catch up on old times? Angela filled me in on how my friends and family are doing.
LEADFEMALE:How is everybody, Angela?
LEADFEMALE:Dead.
SUPMALE:Angela and I are the only two left of the original family.
LEADFEMALE:That's terrible, Angela.
LEADFEMALE:Does that mean you're all alone? No, I have a goat.
OTHERFEMALE:Actually, I lead a very full life.
OTHERFEMALE:I get up, milk the goat, go to a funeral, come back, feed the goat.
SUPMALE:Then I drink Chianti and I pass out.
LEADFEMALE:It's a shame you and Ma don't live closer to each other.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy is right.
LEADFEMALE:How many years do we have left? We should live in the same town.
OTHERMALE:You want to come back to Sicily? Am I a woman who beats her laundry on a rock? You should move here, to Miami.
LEADMALE:That's a great idea.
LEADMALE:You'd love Miami.
LEADFEMALE:Angela, what do you say?
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:I'm too old to move to a strange country.
SUPMALE:What? Before your husband died, you lived here for 30 years.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:Think about it.
LEADFEMALE:Who would you rather live with? Your sister or a goat? Give me a minute.
LEADMALE:All right, I'll do it.
SUPFEMALE:Wonderful.
SUPMALE:Good for you.
OTHERFEMALE:While you're in Sicily, we'll look for a place for you to live.
LEADMALE:Why should she make two trips? She can stay here until we find her a place.
SUPFEMALE:That sounds wonderful, I mean, if nobody minds.
SUPFEMALE:Mind? Why should we mind? Dorothy, could I see you in the living room for a moment?
LEADFEMALE:Are you out of your mind?
SUPFEMALE:What? Why did you invite my sister to live here? You're the one who invited her to live in Miami.
SUPMALE:Yeah, Miami the city, not Miami my house.
SUPFEMALE:Am I missing something? You don't know Angela like I do.
OTHERMALE:She always wanted whatever I had.
LEADFEMALE:Even if she didn't want it.
LEADFEMALE:She'll try to muscle in.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:I think you're overreacting.
LEADMALE:Aunt Angela, where are you going? I'll tape my name on the mailbox.
OTHERMALE:After all, I live here now.
SUPFEMALE:Any more bright ideas, linguini-for-brains? Hi, Rose, what you got there? Just a little snack.
OTHERMALE:Darn, I forgot something.
LEADMALE:Not bad.
LEADFEMALE:What is it? I'm not sure.
OTHERMALE:The pet store calls it Chicken Chow.
SUPMALE:Maledizione, maledizione.
LEADMALE:Ma, what's wrong now? Living with Angela has been a nightmare.
OTHERFEMALE:She'll never leave.
LEADFEMALE:What has she done now?
LEADMALE:She used up my Porcelana.
SUPMALE:Look at all these liver spots.
LEADMALE:I've got more brown skin than the Temptations.
LEADMALE:Ma, I'll get you another bottle.
LEADMALE:At least try to get along with her.
SUPMALE:I have tried.
LEADFEMALE:Did I complain about sharing my bed?
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Or her using my Polygrip? Yes.
SUPMALE:Did I complain when she washed your sweater in a ditch?
LEADFEMALE:She ruined my sweater?
SUPMALE:Maybe I shouldn't say.
LEADFEMALE:She's not going to be here that much longer.
SUPFEMALE:I wish you'd try to be patient.
SUPMALE:She's out right now looking at another place.
OTHERFEMALE:How many places has she seen in the past three weeks? They're "too small," "not enough light," "no room for a goat.
LEADMALE:" She'll be here for ever.
LEADMALE:Like I told you, whatever I have, she wants.
SUPFEMALE:How was the apartment?
SUPMALE:She liked it very much.
LEADFEMALE:What's not to like? Some lovely people live there.
LEADFEMALE:It's close to the beach.
LEADMALE:Are you going to take it? It's kind of small and there's not enough light.
LEADFEMALE:And there's no room for a goat.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:I made dinner.
LEADMALE:It should be ready.
LEADMALE:I was gonna cook dinner.
LEADMALE:I thought, for a change, we'd have a meal with flavour.
LEADMALE:I'm supposed to get along with that? That smells great.
SUPMALE:She probably defrosted something I already cooked.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I did.
LEADMALE:But I had to throw it out.
SUPMALE:It smelt like it had gone bad.
SUPFEMALE:It was probably no good.
OTHERMALE:You cooked it.
LEADMALE:That does it.
LEADFEMALE:Ma got something caught in her throat.
LEADFEMALE:There.
LEADFEMALE:That should take care of it.
SUPMALE:We're out of fresh pepper.
SUPMALE:Do you have any? Yeah, in the pantry in the back.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, this chicken looks great.
LEADFEMALE:Girls.
SUPFEMALE:Girls, Count Bessie is missing.
OTHERFEMALE:I went to the garage to feed her and her cage was empty.
OTHERFEMALE:Where could she be? Aunt Angela.
LEADMALE:Where did you get this chicken? The garage.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess this means no live entertainment with dessert.
LEADMALE:Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you've got to stop torturing yourself like this.
OTHERMALE:Now, Count Bessie is gone.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just such a tragedy.
SUPFEMALE:Who cooks a musician at the height of her career? You've got to put this in perspective.
LEADMALE:Count Bessie was a chicken.
LEADMALE:Angela didn't fire up Doc Severinsen.
LEADFEMALE:How are you doing, Rose?
SUPMALE:Not very good.
LEADMALE:You may not think so now, but in a few days you'll feel better.
SUPMALE:No, I won't.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs Butell will be back by then.
LEADMALE:What am I supposed to say? Welcome home.
LEADMALE:How was your trip? By the way, here's Count Bessie.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, honey, think of the positive things.
LEADFEMALE:Count Bessie accomplished more in a few years on this earth than most chickens do in a lifetime.
LEADFEMALE:Give me a break.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm making this up as I go along.
LEADFEMALE:Above all else, that chicken was a great entertainer.
LEADFEMALE:And a great entertainer deserves to be remembered in a special way.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Like with a roast at the Friars Club.
LEADMALE:I was only kidding.
SUPFEMALE:It was just a joke.
LEADFEMALE:And a pretty darn good one.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, what have you got there? Exhibit A.
LEADMALE:You know, I like Rose.
SUPFEMALE:But when a woman throws herself on a chicken screaming "murderer", she's not playing with a full set of balls.
LEADMALE:I'm getting out of here just in time.
LEADMALE:You found an apartment?
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I went down to the Senior Citizens' Centre this morning.
LEADFEMALE:Decaf coffee, sodium-free bacon and a chest x-ray.
LEADFEMALE:I saw some advertisements for roommates, so I picked out a few places and I found one I liked.
SUPMALE:Isn't that wonderful? My new roommate will come to help me move my stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Thief.
LEADFEMALE:What?
LEADFEMALE:What's that on your neck?
OTHERFEMALE:A wart.
LEADFEMALE:That's my necklace Momma gave me for confirmation.
LEADFEMALE:You always wanted it.
SUPFEMALE:I did not.
LEADMALE:Why take it?
LEADMALE:To cover the wart.
LEADFEMALE:Give me back my necklace.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:She's accused me of stealing everything of hers that wasn't nailed down.
SUPMALE:I'm sick of it.
SUPMALE:I'm glad I'm moving.
LEADFEMALE:Moving?
LEADFEMALE:Angela found an apartment.
OTHERFEMALE:I know you hate me, so don't bother visiting.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, you two.
OTHERMALE:Ma, she is your only sister.
LEADMALE:OK.
LEADFEMALE:All we've done is fight for three weeks.
LEADMALE:How about a truce? OK.
SUPMALE:A truce.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Tony.
SUPMALE:You know him?
OTHERFEMALE:He's my boyfriend.
OTHERFEMALE:That's my new roommate.
LEADMALE:I thought this address sounded familiar.
SUPMALE:Boy, this is some coincidence.
LEADFEMALE:This is no coincidence.
OTHERFEMALE:Everything I have, you try to steal.
LEADMALE:May the bags under your eyes grow so large your head falls in 'em.
OTHERMALE:May your shampoo get mixed up with Preparation H and shrink your head to mushroom size.
OTHERMALE:Tony, the bag.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, just try it.
LEADMALE:It doesn't hurt.
LEADFEMALE:See? Hi, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Rose.
LEADMALE:Rose, do you know offhand if 911 is the right number to call for a straitjacket?
LEADFEMALE:I can explain.
LEADFEMALE:I know you can.
SUPMALE:That's the scary part.
LEADMALE:You don't understand.
SUPMALE:When Mrs Butell finds out about Count Bessie, she'll be devastated.
LEADFEMALE:There'll be a void in her life, that only another musical chicken can fill.
SUPMALE:If you're worried about voids, start with the one in your head.
SUPMALE:Come on, honey.
SUPMALE:Just a few notes.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, do you believe it? Four chickens and not one of them has any musical ability.
LEADMALE:It's a sad commentary, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:All the young chickens are wasting their time playing video games.
LEADFEMALE:Can I make y'all some lunch? Fruit salad.
OTHERMALE:That sounds good.
LEADMALE:I'll get Sophia.
OTHERMALE:She has no appetite since she was stabbed in the back.
LEADFEMALE:My God.
LEADFEMALE:Who stabbed Sophia? The chef at Benihana.
LEADFEMALE:Angela.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma thinks that Angela tried to steal her boyfriend.
OTHERFEMALE:And you don't?
LEADMALE:Of course not.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be so sure, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Angela and Sophia are sisters.
SUPMALE:Sisters have a natural adversarial relationship.
SUPMALE:That's 'cause it's genetic.
LEADMALE:It has to do with the double helix of the DNA molecule.
LEADMALE:What? I saw it on television.
LEADMALE:Peter Marshall played this microbiologist on The Love Boat and he was conducting sinister experiments on the Landers sisters.
LEADMALE:My apologies, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:For a moment there, I didn't think it had been documented.
LEADFEMALE:What is happening between Sophia and Angela is not unlike an incident between my sister Virginia and me when we were in high school.
LEADFEMALE:Can you believe that one's very own sister could seduce her sibling's boyfriend on the eve of that sibling's senior prom?
LEADMALE:Virginia did that to you?
OTHERFEMALE:No, I did that to Virginia.
LEADMALE:She deserved it.
SUPFEMALE:She borrowed my saddle shoes without asking.
LEADFEMALE:What? She scuffed those shoes.
LEADFEMALE:I hardly left a mark on that boy.
LEADMALE:I'll see you later.
LEADMALE:I'm going over to Tony's.
SUPFEMALE:For lunch?
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I called him.
LEADFEMALE:He was in bed.
SUPFEMALE:I heard female laughter.
SUPFEMALE:It was Angela.
SUPMALE:They're sleeping together, like I suspected.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to kill her.
LEADMALE:I'll be back for Wheel Of Fortune.
LEADMALE:Open up, tramp.
OTHERMALE:I know you're in there.
LEADFEMALE:You can run but you can't hide.
LEADFEMALE:Run? I can barely walk.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Rub it in.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? You and Tony have been fooling around.
SUPMALE:That's a lie.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been shopping all day.
OTHERMALE:In your bath robe?
SUPMALE:I took a shower.
SUPMALE:Kill me.
SUPMALE:Why do you think I came over? How will you do it? Make me eat your ziti?
LEADMALE:Take that back.
LEADFEMALE:I will not.
OTHERMALE:May the hair on your lip get tangled with the hair from your nose.
LEADFEMALE:May you take a diuretic and not be able to get your pantyhose off.
LEADMALE:What's going on here? Taking a shower? I suppose this is your loofah sponge.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? You toyed with my emotions.
LEADMALE:You toyed with my affection.
SUPMALE:You toyed with my sister.
LEADFEMALE:That's not true, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Angela's just my roommate.
LEADMALE:You're the only woman in my life.
LEADFEMALE:There can be no-one else but you, dear.
SUPMALE:Tony.
SUPFEMALE:Angela.
SUPMALE:Boy, who is that woman? This woman.
LEADMALE:She's my cleaning lady.
SUPFEMALE:What? But I'm "the only woman in your life".
LEADMALE:You've insulted my sister's honour.
LEADMALE:I don't know what to say.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you what to say.
LEADMALE:Say "ouch.
LEADMALE:"
LEADFEMALE:Say "that hurts.
OTHERFEMALE:"
SUPFEMALE:Say "please stop hitting me.
LEADFEMALE:" You two just started hitting him with your purses? He was cheating on me.
SUPFEMALE:In Sicily, if Uncle Bruno had heard about this, he'd have been in hot water.
OTHERFEMALE:What would Uncle Bruno do?
SUPMALE:She just told you.
LEADMALE:He would have put him in hot water.
SUPMALE:Something good came out of this.
OTHERMALE:You two are close again.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, right now, but before long we'll be fighting again.
LEADMALE:It's not that we don't love each other.
SUPFEMALE:It's just our relationship.
LEADFEMALE:We get it from our mother.
LEADMALE:Our father.
OTHERMALE:Shut up.
LEADFEMALE:You shut up.
LEADFEMALE:May your nose
LEADFEMALE:Ma.
SUPFEMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:We get it from our father.
LEADMALE:Now, Angela, there's something I want to give you.
LEADMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:That's the necklace Momma gave you.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to have it.
LEADFEMALE:It's my way of apologising for the way I acted.
LEADMALE:Sophia, this is the nicest thing anybody ever gave me.
SUPFEMALE:Don't get choked up.
LEADFEMALE:It's only to hide that wart.
SUPFEMALE:My God, it can't be.
LEADFEMALE:It is.
SUPFEMALE:Count Bessie.
OTHERFEMALE:Angela, that chicken you cooked the other night, didn't you get that from the garage?
LEADMALE:Yes, right.
SUPFEMALE:Out of a cage? No, from the freezer.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think I can kill a live chicken? Am I Conan the Barbarian? I must have left the door open and she wandered away.
SUPMALE:I've got to get another apartment.
SUPMALE:Aunt Angela, until you find a place, stay right here with us.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, can I see you for a moment?
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:You scared me to death.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing? Getting a close-up of your face.
LEADMALE:I'm too close.
LEADFEMALE:Did you have a poppy-seed bagel for breakfast? Put that down.
SUPMALE:What do you think you're doing? Making a video for my class at the junior college.
LEADMALE:Really? It sounds like fun.
SUPFEMALE:I'm glad you think so.
LEADFEMALE:I want you as one of the stars.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:I'm uncomfortable in front of a camera.
OTHERFEMALE:Besides, I always come out looking like Fess Parker.
SUPMALE:This is a documentary.
LEADMALE:It's OK if you're not good-Iooking.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, stop trying to appeal to my ego.
OTHERMALE:The answer is no.
SUPMALE:Sophia, how would you like to star in my video? Are there any nude love scenes? No.
LEADMALE:If it's integral to the plot, I'm happy to do it.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, Sophia wants to be in my video.
LEADFEMALE:Why won't you? Dorothy's always been camera-shy.
LEADFEMALE:You'd be, if you looked like Fess Parker in heels.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, how do you feel about performing in front of a video camera? It's OK as long as you've had at least three dates.
LEADFEMALE:It's for my video class.
LEADFEMALE:My final project is A Day In The Life Of My Roommates.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, honey, that sounds like fun.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Blanche.
LEADMALE:You're a real friend.
SUPMALE:You and Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just shoot around Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Alright, alright, Rose, I'll do it.
LEADMALE:But just don't shoot from too low.
LEADFEMALE:Stan used to do that in our home movies and I always looked like someone from another planet.
SUPFEMALE:She looked like Fess Parker from another planet.
LEADFEMALE:I just got an invitation to the reunion of my college sorority, the Alpha Gams.
LEADFEMALE:I belonged to a sorority when I was in college, the Alpha Yams.
OTHERFEMALE:It was an agricultural college.
SUPMALE:I cannot wait to see my sorority sisters.
SUPMALE:Scarlett and Melanie and all the rest of the girls.
SUPMALE:It's gonna be exactly like old times.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe not just exactly.
LEADFEMALE:The other girls will have grown wrinkled and saggy through the years, while I have remained unbelievably devastating.
SUPMALE:I cannot wait to go back there and rub their noses in it.
LEADFEMALE:It's wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:You make lifelong bonds when you join a sorority.
LEADMALE:I never belonged to one.
OTHERMALE:I was blackballed.
LEADFEMALE:I think that is so cruel.
LEADFEMALE:The Alpha Yams didn't have blackballing.
SUPFEMALE:We believed that any girl who wanted to help her community and foster a feeling of sisterhood
LEADMALE:should be allowed to join.
LEADMALE:Very commendable.
SUPMALE:As long as she could castrate a sheep.
OTHERMALE:There was a service organisation in Sicily with similar membership requirements.
LEADFEMALE:Except that instead of a sheep, it usually involved a mayor from a neighbouring town.
SUPFEMALE:Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Some of Italy's finest sopranos were former mayors.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Rose.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, you're supposed to pretend I'm not here.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm sorry, Rose, but ever since you filmed me naked doing a pedicure, I've become slightly aware of your presence.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, my child.
LEADMALE:Sunshine of my life.
LEADMALE:You got that in a close-up, Rose? Why are you dressed like someone who just escaped from It's A Small World? Come, my darling daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Mother has made you your favourite breakfast.
LEADMALE:Lasagne in meat sauce? Doesn't it look delicious? And think, for just $5.
SUPMALE:95, the recipe can be yours.
SUPFEMALE:Hold it.
LEADMALE:Stop.
SUPFEMALE:Stop the camera.
LEADMALE:Cut.
LEADMALE:The director's the one who says when to cut.
OTHERFEMALE:Unless the actor is big and mad.
LEADMALE:Ma, what is going on? Dorothy, this could be my big chance.
LEADFEMALE:With the exposure I get, I could hawk my recipes around the country.
LEADFEMALE:That's ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:If you wanna move your product, you gotta have exposure.
LEADMALE:All the great Italian chefs had it.
OTHERFEMALE:Mamma Celeste, Chef Boyardee and Chef Balducci.
SUPMALE:I don't remember Chef Balducci.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
OTHERFEMALE:He didn't have television exposure, that was indecent exposure.
LEADMALE:He should've stuffed cannelloni in the traditional manner.
LEADMALE:Hi, girls.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing here? I thought the reunion wasn't over till tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:No, it isn't.
LEADFEMALE:I just decided I'd come home early.
LEADMALE:Is there something wrong? No, nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever gave you that idea? As long as nothing's bothering you.
LEADMALE:Should we defrost a loin of pork so you can scoop up the sauce? I can't help it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so upset.
OTHERMALE:Seeing my sorority sisters was just dreadful.
LEADFEMALE:Why? It was as if time had stood still for 30 years.
LEADFEMALE:Every woman looked wonderful.
SUPMALE:They'd hardly aged at all.
SUPMALE:I saw a movie like that once.
LEADFEMALE:All the women were sucked up into flying saucers.
SUPMALE:And mechanical doubles were sent back to earth to take their place.
LEADMALE:Did any of them mention a leader named Zardos? Rose, I'm saying they had all had face-lifts and they looked absolutely gorgeous.
SUPMALE:It was the most disgusting spectacle I've ever witnessed in my life.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Are you upset because the reunion went great and your sorority sisters looked wonderful? Of course not.
LEADMALE:That would be childish.
LEADMALE:I'm upset because I wasn't the centre of attention and nobody said I was the prettiest.
LEADMALE:Come on now, Blanche.
SUPMALE:What difference does it make? Dorothy.
SUPMALE:You can not possibly begin to comprehend the terrible trauma a gorgeous woman goes through when she realises her beauty is starting to fade.
LEADMALE:And who do you see when you look at me? Joe Pepitone? All my life my beauty has outshone every other woman's.
SUPFEMALE:But no more.
SUPMALE:Now people are cuter than me, my life is over.
LEADFEMALE:If you feel like that about it, you can get a face-lift, too.
LEADFEMALE:I can't.
OTHERFEMALE:Surgery scares me to death.
LEADMALE:That's out of the question.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll just have to grow old along with the rest of us.
SUPFEMALE:I couldn't go on if I looked like you two.
LEADFEMALE:You know, she had me in her corner right up until the end.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:Want some tea?
SUPFEMALE:Nah, I'm trying to cut back.
SUPMALE:Tea stains my dentures.
LEADMALE:I had to soak them in Ajax.
SUPFEMALE:They're white, but my mouth feels like somebody should rinse their socks in it.
SUPFEMALE:Glass of milk?
OTHERMALE:Nah, it upsets my stomach.
SUPFEMALE:Orange juice?
LEADMALE:Too acidic.
LEADMALE:Can I get you anything?
SUPFEMALE:Cup of tea would be nice.
LEADMALE:The rough-cut of my documentary is done for you to see.
LEADMALE:Where's Blanche? Where she's been for the past two days.
LEADMALE:Locked in her room crying.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe she's still upset because her classmates look better than she does.
LEADFEMALE:I can.
LEADFEMALE:I tell you, her looks have always been very important to Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche is a vain person and vanity is a terrible thing.
SUPMALE:I should know.
LEADMALE:I was vain myself.
LEADFEMALE:You, Sophia? You think I was born with white hair and a Play-Doh butt? When I was a teenager, I was gorgeous.
SUPMALE:Eyes as deep and black as ripe olives.
OTHERFEMALE:Skin as smooth and creamy as fresh butter.
SUPMALE:Hair flaming red like a rich marinara sauce.
LEADMALE:Ma, that's not you, that's your lasagne recipe.
LEADMALE:Shut up.
SUPMALE:Anyway, I was the most gorgeous girl in the village and I had my pick of the town's most eligible goat farmers.
SUPMALE:Until Anna Maria Alonso Paladino, known to her friends as Muffin, moved to our village.
LEADFEMALE:Suddenly, all the men, who were always fighting over who would keep the footprints I left in the mud, were after Muffin.
LEADMALE:So, I decided Wait, just a minute.
LEADMALE:They would fight over who kept the footprints you left in the mud? It was a poor village, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:What did you want them to collect, Fabergé eggs? I was too vain to be the second-most beautiful girl in the village.
LEADMALE:So, I went to Muffin and I told her how I felt.
SUPMALE:That was when I found out that beautiful girl was even more beautiful inside.
LEADMALE:She offered to move to the neighbouring village.
LEADMALE:And you felt guilty 'cause you'd been vain.
LEADFEMALE:Hell, no.
SUPFEMALE:I helped her pack.
OTHERFEMALE:But it all backfired in my face because the next day, all the good-Iooking men followed her.
SUPFEMALE:That's how I ended up with your father.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, talk about learning a lesson the hard way.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, girls.
LEADMALE:How are you feeling?
LEADMALE:Much better.
LEADMALE:I've decided I've been acting foolish about this whole thing.
LEADMALE:I guess I still look pretty good.
SUPFEMALE:Pretty good? You look terrific.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:I also decided to be a bit more modest.
OTHERFEMALE:But in this case that's lying, which is worse.
LEADFEMALE:So, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I do look terrific.
LEADFEMALE:Thank goodness that's over with.
SUPMALE:I'm dying for your opinion on my movie.
SUPFEMALE:It's ready.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't do the soundtrack yet, but I got the editing done.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, it'd be better with a bigger TV.
LEADMALE:We know.
LEADFEMALE:It'd be better with music.
LEADMALE:We understand.
LEADFEMALE:And it'd be better It would be better with Shelley Hack.
LEADFEMALE:Turn it on.
SUPMALE:Here goes.
LEADMALE:That's Sophia walking into the kitchen.
OTHERMALE:I didn't know Fess Parker was in this picture.
LEADMALE:Ma, what are you doing?
LEADFEMALE:Mugging for the camera.
OTHERMALE:You're mugging me.
LEADMALE:You're stealing money from my pocket.
SUPFEMALE:I'm seeing if you have change for the bus.
LEADMALE:Now I'm stealing.
LEADMALE:My God.
SUPFEMALE:Is that me? I look awful.
SUPMALE:No, I was out of focus.
LEADFEMALE:You always are.
LEADFEMALE:No, I look old.
SUPFEMALE:I look decrepit.
SUPFEMALE:I look ancient.
LEADFEMALE:I look shrivelled up and wrinkled like a prune.
SUPFEMALE:Could be worse.
SUPFEMALE:She could look like Fess Parker.
LEADMALE:Turn that thing off right now.
SUPMALE:Blanche.
SUPMALE:Blanche, Blanche, now calm down.
LEADMALE:I'm just as calm as can be.
SUPFEMALE:And you know why? Because my worst suspicions have just been confirmed.
LEADMALE:My good looks are fading.
SUPFEMALE:The camera does not lie.
LEADMALE:That leaves me with only one choice.
LEADFEMALE:I am gonna be perfect.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna be gorgeous.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna have my tummy tucked and my butt firmed and my breasts raised and my face lifted.
LEADMALE:It's a shame to do all that and keep that hairdo.
OTHERFEMALE:Here, Rose.
OTHERMALE:What do you think of Cheryl Tiegs' nose? Very nice.
LEADMALE:Kinda small.
LEADMALE:Grandpa Nylund always said, "The air is free.
LEADFEMALE:Have a big honker and suck up as much as you can.
LEADMALE:" Course, he looked like he'd caught a boomerang in his face.
SUPMALE:I like this.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna get it.
LEADFEMALE:What are you getting? I'm picking out the kind of face to show the plastic surgeon.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna get Linda Evans's eyes and Lena Horne's cheekbones and Cheryl Tiegs' nose and Carol Burnett's chin.
LEADMALE:You can get that chin through a catalogue.
SUPMALE:If you put the pieces together, you see what the new me's gonna look like.
LEADMALE:See, there.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think? Why is everyone looking at a picture of Gavin MacLeod? No, this is a collage of the things I'm having done to my face.
SUPFEMALE:You're going ahead with the surgery? I am.
LEADFEMALE:I'm looking forward to it.
SUPFEMALE:I don't believe in it.
LEADMALE:It's unnatural.
OTHERFEMALE:This from a woman who slept with a pig until she was 11.
LEADFEMALE:If it makes you feel better to look better, there's nothing wrong with it.
OTHERMALE:I guess that looking good isn't important to me.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? You wear make-up, have your nails done, colour your hair.
LEADFEMALE:This is my hair's natural colour.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, and John Madden is a finicky eater.
LEADMALE:You might have a point.
SUPFEMALE:But plastic surgery is so drastic.
LEADFEMALE:I'd be scared.
LEADMALE:Believe me, honey, there is nothing to it.
LEADFEMALE:It's not that bad.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, have you had plastic surgery? I don't believe it.
SUPMALE:What did you have done?
SUPFEMALE:My eyes.
OTHERMALE:Worth every penny.
SUPFEMALE:Please, you spent $1,500, you go out on two dates a year.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't do it for anybody else.
SUPMALE:I did it for me.
LEADMALE:Most people didn't know I'd had surgery.
SUPMALE:But I knew.
LEADMALE:It made me feel better about myself.
LEADFEMALE:You were lucky.
LEADFEMALE:It doesn't always work out that well.
LEADFEMALE:It sure didn't for Olga Fetchik.
OTHERFEMALE:Just a minute, Rose.
OTHERMALE:Somebody give me a hand signal when she's finished.
OTHERMALE:Olga Fetchik was our town beautician.
LEADMALE:And one of God's most unattractive creations since the aardvark.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, over the years, Olga had been secretly squirreling away money for plastic surgery.
OTHERMALE:One day she left without telling anyone, had the surgery and didn't return for months.
LEADMALE:Nobody could believe their eyes.
LEADMALE:Olga Fetchik had turned into a stunning beauty.
SUPFEMALE:Every man in town wanted her.
SUPMALE:She ended up marrying St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf's most handsome and eligible bachelor, dance instructor Adolph Step.
SUPFEMALE:The two of them moved back to Norway, decided to get into show business, and became the internationally renowned Scandinavian dance team of Step and Fetchik.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, not that I care, but since you've already gone to so much trouble, just how did having plastic surgery ruin Olga's life? It didn't ruin her life, it almost ruined St.
SUPMALE:Olaf.
SUPMALE:After she left, the town didn't have a professional beautician for years.
SUPFEMALE:Women started giving each other home perms.
LEADMALE:Soon, everybody looked like Art Garfunkel.
LEADFEMALE:Husbands stopped sleeping with their wives, the population started to go down.
LEADFEMALE:The town would have gone under if Oslo's most famous hairstylist, Vidal Sassbogadotter hadn't relocated his shop in St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf because of our more favourable tax laws.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you see why I don't like plastic surgery? What did you do that for? Why should we be alone in pain? You were saying, Rose? Mrs Devereaux, come in, please.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Dr Taylor.
SUPFEMALE:Pleased to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go over your form.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Shall I disrobe here or do you have an examining room? Your medical form that you filled out in the waiting room.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry.
OTHERMALE:You are proposing some very extensive surgery here.
LEADMALE:Eyes, nose, stomach And breasts.
OTHERFEMALE:These are from a magazine.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think? Very nice.
LEADMALE:The angle's a little steep for my personal tastes.
SUPMALE:But they certainly do make a statement.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, they do, they say "big".
LEADMALE:That's exactly what I want.
LEADFEMALE:It just so happens that breasts are my specialty.
OTHERMALE:You have that in common with a linebacker on the Miami Dolphins.
OTHERMALE:As a matter of fact, I've worked on a few celebrities.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me, what celebrities have you done? Now, I can't tell you that.
LEADFEMALE:That would be unethical.
LEADMALE:Let's just say that some of my handiwork is prominently featured on NBC's Thursday night line-up.
LEADMALE:Now, Mrs Devereaux
SUPFEMALE:Call me Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:We're talking about tightening my behind and pumping up my bosoms.
LEADFEMALE:We can be on a first-name basis.
LEADMALE:Alright, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:But I think there's some things that you don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:There are good reasons for having this kind of work done.
SUPFEMALE:But there are also bad ones.
SUPFEMALE:Plastic surgery will only improve your general appearance.
OTHERFEMALE:It won't make you perfect.
LEADFEMALE:And, as with any surgery, there are risks involved.
SUPMALE:There are absolutely no guarantees, no miracles.
SUPFEMALE:Dr Taylor, you are not going to dissuade me from having this surgery.
LEADMALE:You see, all my life, my physical beauty has served as a source of inspiration to me.
OTHERFEMALE:And to countless others.
LEADMALE:But now that beauty seems to be fading and I'm scared.
LEADFEMALE:I've never had to do without it and I don't know if I can.
LEADMALE:I don't mind growing older, as long as I look the same.
LEADMALE:There's no doubt.
OTHERMALE:I don't care about the risks.
SUPFEMALE:I definitely intend to have this surgery.
SUPMALE:Blanche, honey.
OTHERMALE:How are you? You're probably uncomfortable now, but in a few days you'll feel fine.
LEADMALE:Can we get you anything? You've got yourself one hell of a lawsuit there, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Was this a last-minute decision? We're very sorry, sir.
SUPMALE:Nurse, do you know what happened to Mrs Devereaux? She cancelled her surgery.
LEADMALE:She checked out this morning.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry for the inconvenience, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Diodoro.
LEADFEMALE:It's time for your medication.
LEADMALE:Diodoro? Funny, he didn't look Italian.
LEADMALE:She's not out there.
LEADMALE:She isn't in her bedroom.
LEADFEMALE:There's no one in the kitchen now, but the coffee's still warm.
LEADFEMALE:Because we were drinking it less than an hour ago.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, Miss Marple, I'm new at this.
LEADFEMALE:Where have you been?
LEADMALE:You had us worried sick.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, I thought I'd get home before you left.
LEADFEMALE:I would have, if I hadn't seen this stunning dress in a store and realised how it would accentuate the soft, voluptuous curves of my gorgeous body.
OTHERMALE:Gorgeous body? Yesterday it was a bag of russet potatoes with earrings.
LEADFEMALE:That depends on how you look at it.
SUPFEMALE:And Dr Gordon Taylor obviously looked at it with desire in his eyes.
LEADMALE:He asked me out on Friday night.
OTHERFEMALE:So you cancelled the surgery for a date? It wasn't any old date.
SUPMALE:It was with a plastic surgeon.
LEADMALE:Beauty is his stock in trade.
SUPMALE:He can create any face, any body he wants.
SUPFEMALE:What he wanted was mine.
LEADMALE:That got me to thinking.
LEADFEMALE:All my life I have had a unique charm that just kind of flowed naturally.
LEADMALE:If I tampered with that, I could risk losing forever that special magic that is Blanche Devereaux.
LEADFEMALE:That was a risk I was not willing to take.
SUPFEMALE:That's why you decided not to have surgery.
SUPMALE:No, I landed myself a doctor, so he can pay for it.
LEADMALE:Besides, I can live with the lines and wrinkles and sagging, as long as I have you three to grow old with.
LEADMALE:What a lovely thing to say.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Specially since no matter how old we get, I'll always be the youngest, and the prettiest and by far the most desirable.
OTHERMALE:You know, once again she had me in her corner right up until the end.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Hi, Sophia.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Rose.
LEADMALE:You're all dressed up.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you going? The President is in town.
LEADMALE:I'm going to his hotel to see his wife.
LEADMALE:I just loved her in Father Knows Best.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, you're a little confused, honey.
LEADFEMALE:That was Jane Wyatt.
LEADMALE:The President was married to Jane Wyman.
LEADMALE:That old crow from Falcon Crest? Well, they're not married anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Now he's married to Nancy Davis.
LEADFEMALE:From All About Eve?
LEADFEMALE:That's Bette Davis.
SUPMALE:Who beat her kids with wire hangers? No, that was Joan Crawford.
SUPMALE:The fat cop from Highway Patrol? That was Broderick Crawford.
LEADMALE:The President was married to Broderick Crawford? And Mondale still lost? What an idiot! How does this dress look on me? Why worry? It'll soon be on the floor next to an empty Jack Daniel's bottle.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, I want to ask a question.
SUPMALE:Who is the President married to?
SUPMALE:Nancy Reagan.
LEADMALE:Of course.
LEADFEMALE:The one he helps out of helicopters.
OTHERFEMALE:This idiot thinks he's married to Broderick Crawford.
SUPMALE:Get some help, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, that outfit sure is risquÃ©.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you! Would you check my clasp? Now, I just need those earrings you borrowed from me.
SUPFEMALE:I put them back in your room.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, not again?
SUPMALE:I didn't lose them.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you lose everything.
LEADFEMALE:You lost our tickets to see Julio Iglesias.
LEADMALE:You misplaced two sets of house keys.
SUPMALE:You couldn't find your car at the airport.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't lose those earrings.
LEADFEMALE:I'll find them.
LEADFEMALE:Hurry up.
OTHERMALE:I'm due there at six o'clock.
LEADMALE:We've still got plenty of time.
LEADFEMALE:It's only Oh, sorry.
LEADMALE:I forgot all about your tutoring session.
LEADFEMALE:OK.
LEADMALE:We were just finishing.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Blanche.
SUPMALE:You look pretty.
SUPFEMALE:You should see me with earrings.
LEADMALE:So, what are you all doing?
LEADMALE:Algebra.
LEADMALE:Why do I have to learn that? Because I had to learn to teach it! I'm checking the grammar in Mario's story for English.
SUPFEMALE:This is really terrific.
OTHERMALE:It's not terrific.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just OK.
OTHERFEMALE:It is much better than OK.
LEADMALE:Blanche, listen.
LEADFEMALE:Don't read it.
OTHERMALE:You'll embarrass me.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:I'll just read it from there to there.
OTHERMALE:OK? But then you'll miss the spirit of the whole piece.
SUPMALE:Take it from here.
SUPFEMALE:"On his first night in America, his uncle took him to a movie.
LEADFEMALE:" "He felt more excited than ever in his life, watching that movie, because of the feeling he got, sitting there with those other people, laughing together, getting scared together.
SUPMALE:" "He felt like they were his friends.
OTHERMALE:" "To him, that feeling was the feeling of living in America.
SUPFEMALE:" "In America, you always felt like you were among friends.
SUPMALE:" Mario, that's just beautiful.
LEADMALE:You should hear it when I read it.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mario.
LEADMALE:How about a snack? Sure.
SUPMALE:I'm starving.
LEADFEMALE:How about a herring sandwich on raisin bread? Oh, I'm gonna miss my bus.
LEADFEMALE:Your bus doesn't leave till See you tomorrow.
SUPMALE:Bye, Rose, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Adios, Teach.
SUPFEMALE:Hasta maÃ±ana.
LEADMALE:Maybe I should submit his story in the district contest.
LEADMALE:I think you should.
LEADFEMALE:He's a very special kid, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:He really is.
OTHERMALE:I'm crazy about him.
LEADFEMALE:He wants so much to learn.
SUPMALE:He gets this look in his eyes when he's listening.
SUPMALE:You don't see that very often.
SUPFEMALE:I think that look is the whole reason that teachers teach.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, there's a similar look that means, "I'm gonna slash your tires.
LEADFEMALE:" But an experienced teacher can tell the difference.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to a party tonight.
SUPMALE:Can I borrow your earrings? Of course, but why not wear your usual ones? Would you like to field that one, Rose? Blanche, I have looked all over the house.
SUPMALE:I cannot find your earrings.
LEADMALE:But I found the Julio Iglesias tickets.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, we had great seats.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, I feel awful about this.
SUPMALE:Oh, forget it.
LEADFEMALE:I never intended to keep those earrings my entire life, like my momma did.
LEADFEMALE:And my grandmomma.
OTHERMALE:And my great-grandmomma, who fashioned those earrings from the Civil War bullets that killed Great-Grandaddy.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll make this up to you.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it.
SUPMALE:No, I've already decided.
SUPFEMALE:For one week I am going to be your personal videnfrogen.
SUPFEMALE:Can one woman do that for another? Only if they're the same height.
SUPFEMALE:What the hell is a weedenfrurgen? Videnfrogen.
LEADMALE:It's a personal servant.
LEADFEMALE:It's the only way to make up for this.
LEADFEMALE:We've done it in my family for years.
LEADMALE:Ever since Uncle Ben lost Lars Olsen's artificial leg.
OTHERFEMALE:It was the day of the big four-county toboggan race, and without his leg, Lars came in dead last.
LEADFEMALE:That was a day to remember.
OTHERMALE:I think every American remembers where he was the day Lars lost that toboggan race.
SUPMALE:Well, Uncle Ben felt just terrible.
SUPMALE:I mean, Lars said he forgave him, but you could tell there were still hard feelings.
LEADMALE:Lars kept trying to run Ben down with his bicycle.
LEADMALE:But with only one leg,
SUPMALE:how fast
OTHERMALE:Could he pedal? Well, finally, Uncle Ben suggested something to clear the air properly.
LEADFEMALE:For one week, he would be Lars's personal videnfrogen, and do whatever Lars wanted.
OTHERMALE:Lars agreed, and it worked.
SUPMALE:It always works.
LEADFEMALE:So, won't you give it a try? Fine, but not now.
SUPMALE:I'm late for my date.
SUPFEMALE:I'll grab those earrings.
LEADFEMALE:See you later.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd better see if I can help.
LEADMALE:Rose Listen.
LEADMALE:I'm going to ask a question that I know I'll hate myself for asking, but whatever happened to Lars's missing leg? They found it, at the annual Edelweiss and Jarlsberg Choral Festival.
LEADMALE:Uncle had used it to beat off wolves when he set up the bleachers.
LEADMALE:Just as I suspected.
LEADFEMALE:Now I know why they say lying in the sun is dangerous.
LEADMALE:Oh, Sophia, we've only been out here for a little while.
LEADMALE:At your age you don't need to worry about wrinkles.
LEADFEMALE:Who's talking about wrinkles? I can't get up.
LEADFEMALE:My butt is stuck to the chair.
SUPMALE:I'll help you.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'll do that.
SUPMALE:That's alright, Rose.
LEADMALE:That's what a servant is for.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not comfortable having you work for me.
LEADFEMALE:I am.
LEADMALE:You wanna be my servant? I'm not talking about big things.
LEADMALE:It's about little things, like doing your laundry.
LEADFEMALE:My laundry's more fun, Rose.
LEADMALE:Then I'll feel better about losing your earrings.
LEADFEMALE:Ever see panties from the '20s, Rose? They got pockets.
LEADMALE:Please, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I just don't feel right.
LEADMALE:You don't feel right? Well, what about me? What about the guilt that twists deeper and deeper inside me? What about the tortured days and the sleepless nights I've spent thinking of some way to make up for this? Oh, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be so selfish.
SUPFEMALE:Let me be your videnfrogen.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Be my vleedenflugen.
LEADFEMALE:Frogen.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, terrific news! Remember Mario's story that I submitted in the contest? It won first prize! Why, Dorothy, that's wonderful! Anyway, I thought that tomorrow, when he comes for his lesson, I would give him a surprise party to celebrate.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's a great idea! I just love surprise parties.
SUPMALE:Every year on my birthday, George took me to the Country Club, saying it would be a nice, quiet little dinner.
SUPMALE:Then we'd walk into the dining room, and our friends, all from the finest families, would yell, "Surprise!" And every year I'd pretend to be surprised.
LEADFEMALE:It always made George so happy.
LEADFEMALE:But how could you fake it every year? Well, Dorothy, I faked it three times a week.
SUPFEMALE:That always made George happy, too.
LEADMALE:I've only been to one surprise party, but I'll never forget it.
SUPFEMALE:It was for Grandma Nylund's She was from a whaling village, so we made that the theme.
LEADFEMALE:We all dressed as Vikings, with helmets and spears.
LEADMALE:And we all crowded into her little room over the barn, and she walked in and lit a candle.
LEADMALE:And we yelled, "Surprise!" And she dropped dead right there.
LEADMALE:We all thought that was such a nice way to go.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy If I live to be 100, make me a promise.
SUPMALE:I promise, Ma, no surprise party.
LEADFEMALE:No, promise me a new apartment.
LEADMALE:They make me crazy.
LEADMALE:Well, I'd better start planning Mario's party.
LEADMALE:Let me plan it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you don't have to.
OTHERFEMALE:No, but I want to.
LEADFEMALE:There's nothing I like better than planning a party.
LEADMALE:Sure?
LEADFEMALE:Yes, there's nothing to it.
SUPMALE:Well, fine, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Plan the party.
LEADFEMALE:I went as fast as I could.
SUPFEMALE:You forgot the peanut-butter vanilla ice cream.
OTHERFEMALE:That's Mario's favorite.
LEADMALE:I was sure chocolate was his favorite.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I bought it.
SUPMALE:Oh, my goodness me! I think you're right.
LEADMALE:Whose favorite is the peanut butter? Oh, it must be mine! Just put that in the freezer for me, would you, Rose? Mmm, videnfrogens, what a lovely idea.
OTHERFEMALE:If we'd had them in the old days, we wouldn't have had that disruptive Civil War.
SUPMALE:Has anyone seen today's paper? Sophia left it on the lanai.
SUPFEMALE:Just in time.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, fetch the paper.
OTHERMALE:Okey-dokey.
LEADFEMALE:Seems like you've gotten more comfortable giving Rose things to do.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, deep down it still saddens me, but psychologically it's very important to Rose.
SUPMALE:I just don't give her anything too demeaning.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:Should I read it to you and massage your feet, like this morning? No.
OTHERFEMALE:Just be a good videnfrogen and keep your mouth shut.
SUPMALE:I've heard there's an article in here about Mario's winning the contest.
OTHERMALE:God, there's a picture, and I'm in it.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see.
LEADFEMALE:No, I look terrible.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on.
SUPMALE:You always think you look terrible in pictures.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see it.
LEADFEMALE:Now, that's ugly.
LEADFEMALE:I think I hear him in the kitchen.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Surprise! Louder next time.
SUPFEMALE:My heart's still beating.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, Ma.
LEADMALE:We thought you were Mario.
OTHERMALE:You'll have to scream louder to kill him.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:What's going on?
LEADMALE:Oh, Mario! You spoiled our surprise.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:I'll come in again, totally unsuspecting.
OTHERMALE:Here I come, suspecting nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Surprise! Oh, this is great! What a surprise! But it's not my birthday.
SUPFEMALE:I know, honey.
LEADFEMALE:We're celebrating your winning that contest.
SUPMALE:Oh, wow! Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:We're so very, very proud of you.
SUPFEMALE:And Dorothy says your friend Barbara was proud of you, too!  Yes?
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy Zbornak?
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Burt Nesbitt.
SUPMALE:I'm looking for Mario Sanchez.
SUPFEMALE:The school said he'd be here.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, he Is something wrong? I'm with the Immigration And Naturalization Service.
LEADMALE:We believe he's in this country illegally.
OTHERFEMALE:Mario? You'll have to come with me.
LEADFEMALE:I can't sleep.
SUPFEMALE:I just keep lying there, thinking about Mario's face when he heard he might be deported.
LEADMALE:Well
LEADMALE:Might be, not will be.
SUPMALE:Maybe the judge will let him stay.
LEADMALE:But it's all my fault.
LEADFEMALE:I probably got him kicked out of the country.
LEADMALE:He was here illegally.
LEADMALE:You can't blame yourself.
LEADMALE:You just have to trust the justice system.
SUPFEMALE:That's easy for you to say.
SUPFEMALE:You're not responsible for what happened.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I know just how Dorothy feels.
SUPMALE:When I was young, I witnessed a horse theft on Grandaddy's plantation.
LEADMALE:I screamed for help.
SUPFEMALE:Grandaddy got on his stallion and rode the thief down.
LEADFEMALE:Then, to teach me about justice, Grandaddy dragged that thief into court, with me as the star witness.
LEADMALE:I had to testify in front of a packed courtroom.
OTHERFEMALE:You must have been terrified.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey, I was.
LEADMALE:I didn't know what to wear.
LEADFEMALE:I only had two dresses.
LEADFEMALE:One bright one, suitable for weddings or a cotillion, and one darker one, for funerals or a hanging.
LEADMALE:See, my folks were poor.
SUPMALE:I just had one of those reversible hanginglcotillion dresses.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I picked the bright one.
LEADMALE:Now, when I took the stand, a hush fell over that courtroom.
LEADMALE:I told the judge what I'd seen, and after my testimony, that horse thief's fate was sealed.
LEADMALE:Justice won the day! What's that got to do with what's going on now? Well, like any good story, mine was deliberately ambiguous, affording the listener the opportunity to glean from it whatever he may.
LEADMALE:And I hate being left out of conversations.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? Yes.
LEADMALE:No, he isn't.
LEADMALE:What? What? Oh Oh, my God! Yes, er all right.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:What is it?
OTHERMALE:Mario's uncle.
LEADFEMALE:He's run away.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no! Where will he go?
LEADFEMALE:There's only one place I know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:We'll go with you, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE: I can't see a thing.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of a movie is this?
LEADFEMALE:Rip his throat out!
LEADMALE:It's a musical, Rose.
LEADMALE:I think that's Mario sitting down there in the front.
LEADMALE:You girls stay here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I just hate violent movies.
LEADMALE:Shhh!
SUPMALE:It's like watching an autopsy.
LEADMALE:Shhh!  Is this seat taken?  Did I miss the part where he rips the guy's throat out? You've seen this movie six times, so you shouldn't mind a few questions.
LEADFEMALE:Does this mean you've decided to run away, instead of going to see that judge? Well, I can't make you change your mind.
SUPFEMALE:I can't even make you put an R in "February".
LEADFEMALE:But I'd like to talk about it.
LEADFEMALE:That judge will send me back.
LEADFEMALE:He might not.
LEADMALE:Some people come here and stay.
LEADMALE:You're looking at one.
SUPMALE:Arnold Schwarzenegger.
SUPFEMALE:He became an American citizen, started a whole new career, married a Kennedy.
LEADFEMALE:Right now he's tearing off another guy's arm and hitting him with it, but you do see my point? I don't want to go back.
LEADFEMALE:I know you don't, and I don't want you to go, either.
LEADFEMALE:I wish I could say you won't have to, but I can't.
SUPMALE:I promise you, though, that running away is not the answer.
LEADFEMALE:Aaaargh!
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! Oh, I'm sorry, Mario.
SUPMALE:I just I never realized that ripping off a nose would leave that big a hole.
LEADMALE:Anyway, I read a story once that said that in America you always feel like you're among friends.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think? That was just a story.
SUPFEMALE:It was a true story.
LEADMALE:Will you see that judge with me? Will you start putting an R in "February"? OK.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go home.
LEADMALE:OK, girls.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Blanche! Dorothy, I just can't take my eyes off that man's body.
SUPMALE:I want to see more.
LEADMALE:He's covered with oil, wearing a loincloth.
LEADMALE:How much more can you see? I don't know, but I'm going down front to find out.
OTHERMALE:Whoa! What time did Mario say he was coming? When he hears from the judge.
SUPFEMALE:Why couldn't that judge decide at the hearing? I thought he was going to.
LEADMALE:I spent 20 minutes giving him reasons why Mario should be allowed to stay.
LEADFEMALE:He said "thank you" and excused us.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I've made your lunch.
SUPMALE:It's on the table.
SUPFEMALE:Won't you join me, Dorothy?
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:It might take my mind off Mario.
SUPMALE:Did you make enough for three?
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, have yours when you've finished rotating my tires.
SUPFEMALE:Yes? Hi.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Sam Burns.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a friend of Blanche's.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, come in.
SUPMALE:No, don't bother.
LEADMALE:I just wanted to drop something off.
LEADMALE:I found these between the cushions of my love seat.
LEADMALE:Blanche's earrings!
LEADFEMALE:She left them there last week.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and er she er left her watch, too.
SUPMALE:Her watch? Thank you.
LEADMALE:I'll see that she gets them.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Blanche, could you come out here?
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong, honey?
SUPFEMALE:Er that was Sam Burns.
LEADMALE:He found these in his love seat.
LEADMALE:My earrings! Thank you.
LEADMALE:Aren't we forgetting?
LEADMALE:What?
LEADFEMALE:An apology.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, you don't have to apologize for sleeping with Sam.
LEADMALE:Everybody does.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche Devereaux, you sit down and shut up and listen.
OTHERMALE:I didn't sleep with him or lose the earrings.
SUPFEMALE:You did.
SUPFEMALE:Along with my watch, which I didn't know you'd borrowed.
SUPFEMALE:I thought I said.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Well, "sorry" doesn't cut it.
OTHERMALE:I've been making your bed, your breakfast, your stinking tuna sandwiches with the crusts cut off.
LEADMALE:And for what? For nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's all over.
LEADMALE:You won't have this videnfrogen to kick around anymore.
OTHERMALE:What is all the shouting about? I'll explain later.
OTHERMALE:Right now I have to pour on a little Southern charm.
OTHERMALE:And if that doesn't work, I might have to eat Yankee crow.
LEADMALE:I don't like that look.
LEADFEMALE:Bad news.
LEADMALE:They're sending me back.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mario, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:It's not your fault.
SUPMALE:Oh, but it's just It's so unfair.
LEADMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:But we don't have to give up.
SUPFEMALE:We'll fight this.
LEADMALE:There are legal ways to keep you here, and tomorrow we'll find them.
LEADMALE:I have to go tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Then I'll do it myself, and we'll get you back here.
LEADMALE:I promise.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna miss you.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna miss you, too.
LEADMALE:Now, you keep up with your homework and tell me how you're doing.
SUPFEMALE:I will.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll never forget you.
LEADFEMALE:Huh! You won't have time to.
SUPMALE:You'll be back here before you know it.
LEADFEMALE:This is your home, where you belong.
LEADMALE:You're what this country is all about.
OTHERFEMALE:Say goodbye to Rose and Blanche for me.
LEADFEMALE:OK.
LEADFEMALE:Adios, Teach.
LEADMALE:Mario So, I was doing it for your own good.
SUPMALE:Treating you like a dog was really doing you a favor.
SUPMALE:So, why don't we forget all about it? OK? Hmm?
LEADMALE:Mario's got to go home.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy! Oh
LEADMALE:He asked me to say goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I could sure use a family hug now.
LEADMALE:Oh, darling! Oh, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, you've had a rough day.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you what.
LEADMALE:Get into bed, and I'll bring you a hot chocolate.
SUPMALE:Oh, you needn't.
LEADMALE:I want to.
LEADMALE:I'll bring some cookies and move the TV in.
LEADMALE:You don't have to bother.
OTHERMALE:Oh, it's no bother.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:You heard her, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Get cracking.
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Give me a break! This is highway robbery.
LEADMALE:I'm on a fixed income.
LEADFEMALE:OK.
SUPFEMALE:I'm desperate.
SUPMALE:You got a deal.
LEADFEMALE:60.
LEADMALE:Oh, good news.
LEADMALE:I got your date for the banquet.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, I'll get my own date.
LEADFEMALE:Fine, pay 100.
LEADMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:Help me finish these invitations.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, girls.
OTHERMALE:Boy, am I stuffed! I sampled food from over ten caterers.
LEADFEMALE:Find one for the banquet?
SUPMALE:Not yet.
SUPMALE:Oh, but I did learn that baked Alaska can actually be cooked locally.
LEADMALE:I have an even bigger scoop for you.
LEADFEMALE:Mars bars are made right here on earth.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, girls, this time I have really done it.
LEADMALE:Thanks to me, the hospital charity banquet will be in the Bedford Hotel! Blanche, the Committee is on a budget.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:I worked out a deal.
SUPFEMALE:We can't afford that room.
LEADFEMALE:But I worked out a deal.
SUPFEMALE:I told the manager, if we got that room, I'd persuade my sister to sing in his bar.
LEADFEMALE:You mean your sister Virginia?
LEADFEMALE:No, my sister Susan Anton.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, how could you tell such a lie? He didn't believe me for a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Said I was too attractive to be related to her.
OTHERMALE:But we got the room, cos he liked my moxie.
OTHERFEMALE:And you liked showing him it.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, we have a place.
LEADFEMALE:Now we need a caterer.
SUPMALE:One's dropping by this afternoon.
LEADMALE:Did you hire the band?
LEADFEMALE:Rose is supposed to.
OTHERFEMALE:I warn you, we may end up with the Hansger Flugenhaben Yodeling Quartet.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Not true.
SUPMALE:They broke up.
SUPMALE:But the Sonia Van KÃ¼gel Tuba Band is free.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Jake Smollens from VIP Catering.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello.
OTHERMALE:I'm Rose Nylund from St Olaf, Minnesota.
LEADMALE:These are my friends, Dorothy and Blanche.
SUPMALE:Blanche Devereaux.
LEADMALE:I am Chairman of the Planning Committee.
SUPMALE:So, could you tell us something about your background? Well, I've run VIP Catering for five years.
SUPFEMALE:Before that I was a cook in the Navy.
LEADMALE:I can cook beef for 1,500 or Chateaubriand for two.
LEADMALE:No, Mr Smollens.
LEADMALE:What I meant was, are you married? No, I'm not, and please, call me Jake.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my pleasure.
OTHERMALE:I once had an Uncle Jake.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, he could never cook.
SUPFEMALE:He also could never get through our 4th of July picnics without unzipping his overalls.
LEADMALE:Too bad your uncle can't make it to the banquet.
LEADMALE:So, er tell me, Jake.
SUPMALE:How much do you think these meals will cost? Well, do you want something simple or fancy? We want something cheap.
SUPMALE:I admire your honesty.
LEADMALE:I admire your chest.
OTHERMALE:I mean, er exactly what kind of meal are we talking about? I could do a nice Yankee pot roast.
SUPMALE:Mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables, wild green salad.
LEADMALE:And for starters, my special, clam chowder.
SUPFEMALE:No charge.
OTHERMALE:Mm-mm.
OTHERMALE:That sounds delicious.
LEADMALE:Just consider yourself hired.
LEADMALE:Now when shall I come to your place to sample what you have to offer? I got a better idea.
LEADFEMALE:There's a romantic diner on the Boardwalk.
LEADMALE:They use my recipes.
SUPFEMALE:I'll pick you up tomorrow, and we'll check out a few things.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you'd never ask!
LEADFEMALE:Swell.
SUPMALE:I'll see you tomorrow night.
LEADFEMALE:OK.
LEADMALE:Nice meeting you, ladies.
LEADMALE:Nice meeting you.
OTHERMALE:Our pleasure.
SUPMALE:Wow! What a hunk! I know.
SUPFEMALE:Eat your hearts out! Did it ever occur to you that Rose or I might be interested in Jake? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:And you still used every ploy to nab him?
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Then what do you have to say? Damn, I'm good.
SUPMALE:Well, isn't this romantic? Oh, yes, it certainly is if you happen to be Popeye.
SUPFEMALE:Jake, what can I do for you?
LEADMALE:We'd like the best table.
LEADFEMALE:OK, buddy.
SUPMALE:Oh, this is great.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE:And we'll have the usual.
OTHERFEMALE:Alright.
SUPMALE:Is this really the best table?
SUPMALE:Did you get a splinter?
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Then this is the best table.
SUPMALE:You're pulling my leg.
LEADMALE:I'd like to.
OTHERFEMALE:Stop being naughty!
OTHERMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't mean that.
LEADFEMALE:Neither did I.
LEADMALE:Be naughty again! You're one hell of a woman.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Go on.
OTHERMALE:Well, in all my years in the Navy I've never met anybody like you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, in all my years dating the Navy, I've never met anybody like you.
OTHERFEMALE:Erm Jake, is it my imagination, or is there a tattoo of a nose on your arm? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I got that when I first joined the Navy back in '51.
SUPMALE:I was a kid.
SUPFEMALE:I was drunk.
SUPMALE:So was the tattooist.
LEADMALE:I asked for a rose, he thought I said "nose".
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Blanche
LEADFEMALE:I really like being with you.
OTHERMALE:I like being with you, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Mmm.
LEADFEMALE:This looks delicious.
SUPFEMALE:Now, before you eat that clam chowder, there's one thing.
LEADMALE:What? It tastes better if your lips are warmed up.
LEADMALE:I see now why it's so romantic here.
LEADMALE: Thank you.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:And now, for my next number, I'll play something by one of my favorites and, I hope, one of yours.
LEADFEMALE:Huey Lewis And The News! Er I think we've heard enough, Mr Hinkley.
SUPFEMALE:OK.
LEADFEMALE:We go right to the big finale.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid we're out of time.
LEADFEMALE:But it's a real show-stopper.
SUPMALE:I hold up two lit sparklers with my hands, and play Hey, Look Me Over with my feet.
LEADMALE:Smoking a cigarette?
LEADMALE:No? Darn.
SUPMALE:You were this close.
LEADMALE:Goodbye.
LEADMALE:Oh, we're in trouble.
SUPFEMALE:We've auditioned a dozen musicians.
LEADMALE:The banquet is two weeks away, and we've no band.
LEADMALE:What do we do? I'll tell you what we're gonna do, Rose.
SUPMALE:We're gonna eat a cheesecake.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Ma.
OTHERMALE:Shouldn't you be finishing those invitations? I'm here for some water.
LEADFEMALE:Stamp-licking dries me out.
SUPMALE:Why don't you use a sponge?
LEADFEMALE:I'd rather drink from a glass.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, don't you and Jake have dinner reservations tonight? Yes, we do.
SUPFEMALE:He's late.
LEADMALE:Well, he must have a good reason.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, who cares? He is a dreamboat.
LEADMALE:Yes, being with Jake has been wonderful, but I cannot get used to some things.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Like what? Well, it's a question of breeding.
LEADFEMALE:He uses fingers instead of his knife to eat.
LEADFEMALE:Tucks his napkin into his collar.
SUPFEMALE:Wears white after Labor Day.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, the man is a winner.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter with you? I don't know.
SUPMALE:Maybe I'm just overly critical.
SUPFEMALE:That sometimes happens when you're stunningly beautiful.
SUPFEMALE:Not to mention endlessly irritating.
LEADMALE:Blanche, Jake's here.
LEADFEMALE:Make yourself at home.
LEADMALE:Don't touch anything.
OTHERMALE:Hi, everybody.
OTHERMALE:You are filthy! I helped a lady stranded by the roadside, and ended up fixing her transmission.
SUPMALE:Aren't there professionals who do that? Andy Granatelli does.
LEADMALE:Although he doesn't actually fix them himself.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't want to dirty his trench coat.
OTHERMALE:But I hear he has this special school I 
SUPMALE:"Shut up, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:" Please, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll make it up to you.
LEADFEMALE:I'll pack a picnic basket and we'll drive to the beach.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll spread a blanket on the sand, take you in my arms I forgive you.
LEADFEMALE:I mean I mean Blanche should forgive you.
LEADMALE:Oh, alright.
SUPMALE:I forgive you.
LEADMALE:But forget the picnic.
LEADMALE:I'll get us that blanket.
LEADFEMALE:He's a wonderful man.
SUPMALE:Oh, I know.
LEADFEMALE:Why can't I ever attract men like that?
LEADMALE:You can, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma, you really think so? No, but you think I'm gonna tell you that? Ma, did you mail all the invitations? None of the Gs through the Ls has responded.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure, I took them in a shoebox to the post office.
LEADMALE:Unless
SUPMALE:Unless what? Unless I sent my best pair of heels overnight mail.
LEADMALE:Ma, this is terrible! You're telling me.
LEADFEMALE:Now I don't have shoes for the party.
OTHERMALE:Girls, I am so excited! We have a band.
SUPFEMALE:You hired somebody?
LEADFEMALE:Yep, The Great Pretenders.
LEADFEMALE:It's an all-female jazz band.
LEADFEMALE:They're supposed to be fantastic.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, now it's going to be a good party! Oh, it's too bad you couldn't find a better date than Harvey.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I wouldn't brag about my date, if I were you.
SUPMALE:Incidentally, is Walter renting that blue tuxedo again? Walter never rented a blue tuxedo, and you know it.
OTHERFEMALE:He owns that blue tuxedo.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, did Jake call? He is half an hour late.
LEADMALE:No, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Will Jake be able to take you to the banquet? Well, he might be able to take me, but my date is Hunter McCoy.
OTHERMALE:What about Jake?
SUPFEMALE:What about him? Well, Jake has to take you.
LEADFEMALE:You'll both be there.
SUPFEMALE:He'll expect you to be there with him.
OTHERFEMALE:How could you do this? Well, you make it sound so terrible.
LEADFEMALE:It's not.
LEADFEMALE:Jake just doesn't belong with certain people.
LEADFEMALE:He's a blue-jeans kind of guy.
LEADMALE:This is a black-tie affair.
LEADFEMALE:We wouldn't have any fun.
LEADMALE:Sometimes you act just like a woman I knew in St Olaf.
OTHERMALE:Please, no-one say, "What woman?" Blanche, Jake is crazy about you.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll break his heart.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, don't be silly.
SUPFEMALE:Jake knows I care for him, but our relationship can only go so far.
LEADMALE:
OTHERMALE:That's probably him.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, everybody.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Is there somewhere we could be alone?
LEADMALE:Can't it wait till later?
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Alright, I'm flexible.
OTHERMALE:But of course, you know that already! No, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:I want to ask you something now.
LEADFEMALE:Right here, where we first met.
LEADFEMALE:Erm Ma, Rose, why don't we go into the kitchen?
SUPFEMALE:What, and miss all this?
LEADMALE:Get up! Listen.
OTHERFEMALE:I know what you want to ask me.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I've been giving our relationship a great deal of thought, and I just think you're a wonderful man.
SUPFEMALE:I love the time we spend together.
OTHERFEMALE:But we do come from two different worlds, you know, so our relationship can only go so far, and I can't go to the banquet with you.
SUPFEMALE:Well That's not what I was gonna ask you, but you answered my question.
SUPFEMALE:Why? I don't understand.
LEADMALE:I was gonna ask you to marry me.
OTHERMALE:Rose, what are you doing up? I can't sleep.
LEADFEMALE:I'm having nightmares about the banquet.
OTHERMALE:Oh? What kind of nightmares? I'm at the banquet.
OTHERFEMALE:It looks beautiful.
SUPMALE:I look beautiful.
LEADMALE:Everybody looks beautiful.
SUPFEMALE:And suddenly Charlton Heston walks in, dressed like Moses.
LEADMALE:And he tries to part the dessert table.
OTHERMALE:When that doesn't work, he rounds up the guests and leads them to the lingerie department of the nearest JCPenney's where everybody starts making fun of the fat-lady underwear.
SUPFEMALE:What do you suppose it means? That you've spent too many years sleeping on curlers.
SUPMALE:Ma, you can't sleep, either? No, I'm sleeping so good, I thought I'd come try it in the sink.
LEADMALE:I guess everybody's a little jumpy about the banquet.
SUPFEMALE:Except Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:She could at least have the good taste to pretend she can't sleep.
OTHERMALE:She's probably nervous about running into Jake.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes, when people are under pressure, they sleep to escape.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy's father used to do that.
LEADMALE:Unfortunately, it was usually during foreplay.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, the man is dead.
LEADMALE:Longer than you think.
LEADMALE:I feel bad for Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:She's been moping since she and Jake split.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't expect me to feel sorry.
SUPMALE:It's not often that somebody like Jake comes along, and she throws him away.
LEADMALE:Oh, what's everybody doing up? We were saying how dumb you were to give up Jake.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so upset about it I can't sleep.
LEADMALE:Well, give him a call.
LEADMALE:Oh, I can't.
OTHERFEMALE:He'd try to see me again.
OTHERFEMALE:That's out of the question.
LEADMALE:I don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with Jake? I think he's wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:And you're miserable without him.
LEADMALE:Well, that may be, but in some ways, in some very important ways, we're not compatible.
LEADFEMALE:You mean he's not good enough?
LEADFEMALE:No, I don't.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche! If we stayed together, our differences would turn us against each other.
LEADFEMALE:I care too much to allow that.
LEADMALE:You're lucky you have a choice.
LEADFEMALE:My marriage was arranged.
OTHERMALE:You didn't pick Pop?
LEADMALE:He didn't pick me, either.
OTHERMALE:We learned to love each other, but it wasn't our idea.
LEADMALE:There were eight unmarried girls and eight unmarried boys in the village.
LEADMALE:How did they match them up?
SUPMALE:Height.
SUPMALE:If I hadn't stood on that rock, I'd have ended up with Luigi the pig-boy.
LEADFEMALE:If I got another chance at Mr Right, I'd want somebody entirely different from Charlie.
SUPFEMALE:But I thought you adored him.
LEADMALE:I did.
LEADMALE:I am.
SUPFEMALE:We had a wonderful life together.
LEADMALE:But I'd like somebody really wild.
SUPFEMALE:Somebody impulsive, who'd sweep me off my feet.
LEADMALE:He'd come in his convertible Porsche and whisk me to the airport.
OTHERFEMALE:We'd fly to his villa in France, where we'd blindfold the orchestra and dance until dawn.
LEADFEMALE:Then we'd watch the sun come up over two steaming cups of cocoa.
LEADMALE:Cocoa? With little marshmallows.
OTHERMALE:Marshmallows? Rose, you trollop.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, what kind of guy would you like now?  Somebody to get old with.
LEADFEMALE:You can do that by yourself.
LEADFEMALE:I'm aware of that, Rose.
LEADMALE:Stan didn't want to get old.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'd like someone to sit on the porch with, hold hands, listen to the birds, watch the grass grow.
LEADMALE:Blanche, what man do you want?
SUPMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:You certainly do your share of comparison shopping.
LEADMALE:Come on, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:What are you looking for? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I just know it's not Jake.
LEADMALE:But that won't discourage me from finding Mr Right.
OTHERFEMALE:And I won't compromise my standards, either.
LEADFEMALE:I will look high and low, far and wide, and never lose heart, for I know one day my prince will come.
LEADMALE:What was that supposed to mean? I wasn't paying close attention, but I gathered she's gonna sleep with that little black guy, Prince.
LEADMALE:Rose, Rose, can I speak to you? Oh, sure, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Rose, there is something very odd about that all-female jazz band.
LEADMALE:What?
OTHERFEMALE:They're all men.
LEADMALE:I just thought they were really ugly women.
LEADMALE:What do we do?
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing.
OTHERMALE:They're great.
LEADMALE:If we pretend nothing is wrong, maybe no-one will notice.
OTHERMALE:Hey, did you get a load of those queens on the bandstand?
SUPFEMALE:Keep your voice down.
LEADMALE:Why? They know they're queens.
OTHERFEMALE:I think we're a success.
LEADMALE:Congratulations, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Much of the credit goes to the food
LEADFEMALE:original yet familiar, piquant yet comforting.
LEADMALE:Blanche tells me she worked very closely with the caterer.
SUPMALE:Did she mention they were naked? You'll have to excuse my mother.
LEADFEMALE:She was a witness to the Hindenburg disaster.
SUPFEMALE:Jake did a wonderful job.
LEADFEMALE:Where is he? Oh, probably out in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:There he is, by the dessert table.
LEADMALE:Oh, he looks great in his tux! Hunter, would you be a dear and er get me another wine spritzer? Will you do me a favor? Keep Hunter occupied while I go after Jake.
SUPFEMALE:What? You said you never wanted to see him again.
SUPFEMALE:I made a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:A terrible, terrible mistake.
LEADFEMALE:What could I have been thinking? How could I let him go? What difference does it make how he dresses or eats? What matters is, he's the man I love.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Erm Where's Blanche going? Erm she went to powder her nose.
SUPMALE:At the dessert table? Er well, the powder sticks better if you put a thin layer of caramel first.
SUPFEMALE:Hunter, you look skeptical.
LEADFEMALE:Well, hello.
OTHERMALE:I didn't see you standing there.
SUPMALE:Really? I haven't been able to take my eyes off you.
LEADMALE:You look great.
OTHERMALE:Jake, the reason I came over I wanted to tell you I made a mistake.
SUPFEMALE:Our differences don't really matter.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I admire you.
LEADMALE:You're a very special woman.
OTHERFEMALE:But you didn't make a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:You were right.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, I'm happy.
LEADMALE:I like myself.
LEADMALE:I want to share my life with somebody who's as comfortable with me as I am with them.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to wonder if I'm using the wrong fork.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:You said our differences don't matter.
SUPFEMALE:But they did before, and they will again.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, knowing you has been one of the best things that's happened to me in my whole life.
LEADFEMALE:Remember that.
SUPMALE:Jake
SUPFEMALE:Let me kiss you.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, what happened? Well, Jake said he thinks we have too many differences, so we're not getting back together.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, I'm so sorry.
OTHERMALE:I don't understand how I let this thing happen.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so confused.
LEADMALE:Honey, you think you're confused? Take a look at our horn section.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, aren't you even going to try to sleep?  I'm too upset.
SUPMALE:Oh, let's face it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not 16 anymore.
LEADMALE:There's no line of beaux on the front porch waiting to walk me to town.
LEADMALE:No more cotillions, no more sorority parties.
OTHERMALE:I just lost the best thing that's happened to me since I met George.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just a stupid old fool, sitting up all night with a broken heart.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche Devereaux, I cannot believe what I am hearing.
SUPFEMALE:You are the prettiest, most vibrant, most exciting woman I know.
LEADMALE:Men still line up for you.
LEADMALE:Really? Your dance card is going to be full for the rest of your life.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know whether you meant that or not, Dorothy, but thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Damn, I'm good.
LEADMALE:
OTHERMALE:A few more snacks like that, the only thing you'll fit into is a saddle.
OTHERMALE:I'm not going to eat it all at once.
SUPMALE:There's an I Love Lucy marathon on tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I'm setting up for 12 straight hours of classic TV.
SUPFEMALE:I never liked it.
LEADFEMALE:Every episode Lucy said the same thing.
SUPFEMALE:"Ricky, why can't I be in the show?" Why couldn't she be in the show? She was a riot at home.
SUPMALE:His show with the club stank.
LEADMALE:What's entertaining about a Cuban beating a drum? Rose, there's an I Love Lucy marathon on tonight.
LEADMALE:You wanna watch it with me?
LEADMALE:That sounds great.
SUPFEMALE:Who's in it? Who's in it? Um Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.
SUPFEMALE:The Ricardos and Mertzes.
OTHERMALE:Don't tell me you never saw I Love Lucy.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:I never watched much TV until I moved in here.
OTHERMALE:Charlie and I never had a TV.
LEADFEMALE:We talked about getting one, but he said it wasn't perfected yet.
SUPMALE:It sounds like to me Charlie was a little on the cheap side.
LEADMALE:I'll say.
SUPFEMALE:Charlie was a wonderful man, but he could squeeze a nickel till the buffalo pooped.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you, there's something to the power of suggestion.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, would you like to stay up and watch I Like Lucy? I Love Lucy.
LEADMALE:I haven't seen it yet, so I don't know how I'll feel.
LEADMALE:I won't have time with my daughter coming tonight.
LEADMALE:We're gonna be talking about the
LEADMALE:Nothing.
LEADMALE:What's the nothing? The nothing is a nothing.
SUPMALE:If it were something, I'd call it something.
LEADFEMALE:There are more important things to talk about.
LEADMALE:Is that rumaki? Dorothy, you're keeping a secret from us.
SUPFEMALE:I tell you everything.
LEADFEMALE:I told you a secret last night.
LEADMALE:You're not a natural blonde?
SUPFEMALE:I am a natural blonde.
LEADMALE:Right, Rose.
OTHERMALE:You and Tina Turner.
SUPFEMALE:Did Dorothy tell you she's gonna be a grandma? Oh, Ma, that was a secret! Oh, Dorothy, why didn't you tell us? Because we're not 100 sure.
SUPMALE:I didn't talk to Kate.
SUPMALE:Ma did.
OTHERFEMALE:She had something she wanted to tell us in person and then she had to throw up.
LEADFEMALE:Call me Kreskin.
SUPFEMALE:She and Dennis have been trying to have children.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, this is so exciting.
LEADMALE:But, honey, we're not sure yet.
SUPMALE:
OTHERMALE:That's Kate.
LEADMALE:I am so nervous all of a sudden.
LEADMALE:I am also very excited.
LEADMALE:I have dreamed about this moment all my life.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Darling.
SUPMALE:Is it my imagination, or was that my ex-husband Stanley? Dorothy, it's me, your ex-husband Stan.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me.
OTHERMALE:With that new toupee I thought you were Ted Danson.
SUPMALE:I just got it today.
LEADMALE:It hasn't had time to settle.
SUPMALE:Oh, wow, is that rumaki?
OTHERMALE:Why are you here?
SUPMALE:I just came to see Kate.
SUPMALE:How did you know she was coming? She left a message.
SUPMALE:I was in Lauderdale.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, of course, I forgot.
OTHERFEMALE:It's spring break.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know why she's coming?
SUPMALE:No, I don't.
SUPMALE:Look at Dorothy's nose grow.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, shut up.
LEADMALE:The yutz has a right to know.
SUPMALE:What should the yutz know? Well, we're not sure, but we think that Kate may be pregnant.
LEADMALE:Wow! That's incredible.
LEADFEMALE:That makes me A yutz.
LEADMALE:Some things never change.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna be a granddaddy, Stanley.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't life a gas? This is amazing.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me again.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:I am going to be a grandfather.
SUPFEMALE:Think about it.
LEADMALE:Part of me will be passed on to that child.
SUPFEMALE:But we'll learn to love it.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Kate, honey.
SUPMALE:Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Hello, Princess.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy.
SUPMALE:It's so good to see you again.
LEADMALE:You look wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:I guess you have some big news, huh? Rose, we'll give them their privacy.
LEADMALE:Oh, you don't have to go.
LEADMALE:I can speak in front of you.
SUPFEMALE:I knew it.
LEADMALE:I knew it.
OTHERMALE:I just knew it.
SUPFEMALE:Stanley, I'm so happy.
OTHERFEMALE:Dennis had an affair and I've left him.
SUPFEMALE:Stan, take your damn hands off me! I'll be honest, I never liked him.
LEADFEMALE:I knew that worm was no good.
SUPMALE:What kind of a man has so little respect for marriage that he can cheat on a wonderful woman and jump into bed with the first available bimbo? But enough about you, Stanley.
LEADFEMALE:Let's talk about Kate's problems.
LEADMALE:We had no problems, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:That's why this was all such a shock.
OTHERMALE:Not even in bed?
LEADMALE:Oh, Stanley.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I'm just trying to help.
OTHERMALE:Most men cheat on their wives because what they have at home is less than satisfying.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, really, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:30 Seconds? Mom, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, sweetheart.
OTHERMALE:We're both being very insensitive.
LEADMALE:How are you feeling, kitten? Fine, Grandma.
OTHERMALE:That's okay.
LEADMALE:A brave front is the first step back.
SUPMALE:Bertrand Russell said that.
LEADFEMALE:Or was it Nipsey Russell? They're both so witty.
LEADMALE:You're right, Grandma.
OTHERMALE:I'm not fine.
LEADFEMALE:He really hurt me.
SUPMALE:I feel so alone.
LEADMALE:Honey, you are not alone.
LEADMALE:You have your family with you.
LEADFEMALE:Your grandma, mother and father will see you through this.
LEADMALE:Absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:I have a business appointment tonight.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna call now and cancel and be here for you.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want you to do that.
LEADMALE:I'm fine.
LEADMALE:Alright.
LEADFEMALE:But I'll only be gone an hour.
SUPFEMALE:Less than half an hour if she doesn't want dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Keep your chin up, princess.
SUPFEMALE:Your chins too, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:You know, I'm still a little confused.
LEADMALE:Now, who exactly is Ricky? Lucy's husband.
OTHERMALE:I thought Desi was.
OTHERFEMALE:Not on the show.
LEADFEMALE:Desi wasn't on the show?
LEADFEMALE:Desi played Ricky.
LEADFEMALE:Who did Lucy play?
OTHERMALE:Lucy.
OTHERMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:But who did she play?
SUPFEMALE:Lucy.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:But who did she play? Lucy played Lucy.
LEADMALE:Well, then, why didn't Desi play Desi? He wasn't tall enough.
LEADFEMALE:I have never seen Kate so upset.
OTHERFEMALE:I am a wreck.
SUPMALE:I feel like this has happened to me.
SUPFEMALE:Like I am the one who had my heart stomped on.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you for all your support.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:It's just that Lucy doesn't know that that's really Fred dressed up as a burglar.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't realize this was more important.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, Blanche, this is the part where my good friends are supposed to shut off the TV.
LEADFEMALE:So shut off the TV or it's out the window.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm touched.
LEADFEMALE:How you holding up?
SUPMALE:I threatened to hurl the TV.
SUPFEMALE:That should give you some indication.
LEADMALE:Kate seems to be handling things pretty well.
SUPFEMALE:That's tonight.
LEADMALE:She's still in shock.
LEADMALE:Oh, I remember when Stanley told me he was having an affair.
LEADFEMALE:It was at least 24 hours before I cut the crotches out of all of his slacks.
LEADMALE:You didn't.
LEADMALE:I was teaching English Lit at the time.
LEADFEMALE:Symbolism was my life.
LEADFEMALE:I remember how I felt when I thought Charlie was cheating on me.
LEADFEMALE:Charlie? We'd been married for 18 years.
LEADMALE:And up until then, everything had seemed so perfect.
SUPFEMALE:Then one night it happened.
SUPFEMALE:He came home, had dinner, walked upstairs and went to sleep.
LEADMALE:I went in the bathroom and cried my eyes out.
LEADMALE:Rose, I don't want to encourage long stories, but it seems in this story you left out the
OTHERFEMALE:The story.
LEADMALE:That's the word.
SUPMALE:Well, Charlie went right to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:We didn't, well you know And he'd promised? No! It's just that that was the first time it had happened in 18 years of married life.
LEADFEMALE:Get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:You mean to say that every night without fail for 18 years, you and Charlie Of course.
LEADFEMALE:Right after dinner.
SUPMALE:Well, no wonder you never heard of I Love Lucy.
LEADMALE:Of course, as it turned out, I was just overreacting.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, it was a freak, one-time thing.
SUPMALE:By the next morning, everything was back to normal.
LEADFEMALE:By morning? You mean to tell me, that every morning? Charlie said that's why we didn't have headaches and we both had really shiny hair.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, Rose, no offense, but I find that story a little hard to believe.
OTHERMALE:You don't even like to talk about sex.
LEADFEMALE:In my experience, people who talk about it don't do it very often.
SUPFEMALE:Coffee, anyone?
SUPFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:That must be Stan.
SUPMALE:I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Blanche, why do they do it? Why do men do it and think they can get away with it? Same reason a dog licks himself, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:Because he can.
LEADMALE:Where's Stan?
SUPMALE:It wasn't Stan at the door.
OTHERMALE:Who was it? Just stay calm.
OTHERFEMALE:Just relax and don't do anything you'll be sorry for.
SUPFEMALE:Dennis.
LEADMALE:Hello, Mother Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you'd show your face.
OTHERFEMALE:I think you should leave.
LEADFEMALE:Mother Dorothy
LEADFEMALE:Do not call me that.
LEADFEMALE:I hate it when you call me Mother Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I feel I should be handing out rice on the streets of Calcutta.
LEADMALE:Where is Kate?
LEADMALE:She's not here.
LEADFEMALE:She said she was coming here.
OTHERMALE:She left.
LEADMALE:Where did she go?
LEADMALE:To meet with Marlo Thomas.
LEADMALE:They're going to drink white wine spritzers and figure out how to fry your wandering male behind.
LEADFEMALE:Dennis.
OTHERFEMALE:Kate, we have to talk.
SUPFEMALE:She has nothing to say.
OTHERMALE:Get out.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, you don't have to speak for me.
LEADMALE:Dennis, get out.
LEADMALE:Kate, please.
LEADFEMALE:You don't owe it to me and I'll go if you want.
LEADMALE:I'm just asking to speak to you.
OTHERMALE:I wonder how he's going to talk his way out of this one.
LEADMALE:No matter what he says, she'll see right though it.
LEADFEMALE:Good for Kate.
SUPFEMALE:That bum deserves everything he gets.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad he showed up.
OTHERMALE:She can get it over with.
LEADFEMALE:You think she'll still see Marlo Thomas? 'Cause I'd sure like an autograph.
LEADMALE:Oh  I can't stand it anymore.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you said everybody loved Lucy.
SUPMALE:She's talking about Kate and Dennis.
LEADFEMALE:How long have they been in there? Since Lucy went to Scotland.
SUPMALE:That would make it over 30 years.
SUPFEMALE:It's been an hour, but Kate had a lot to get off her chest.
LEADMALE:You think he'd have the courtesy to say goodbye.
SUPMALE:He's coming back, Mom.
SUPMALE:What? He's getting a suitcase out of the car.
LEADFEMALE:We talked things over.
LEADMALE:Everything's okay.
LEADMALE:Okay? Everything's okay?
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:What about Lucy? We'll watch it on the portable.
OTHERMALE:But that set's black-and-white.
LEADFEMALE:Dennis explained everything.
LEADMALE:Explained? Explained what? How he did it? I explained that when you were 12.
SUPMALE:I can live with his apology.
SUPMALE:He's very sorry.
LEADFEMALE:He'll never do it again.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to end my marriage over this.
LEADFEMALE:I think you're making a mistake.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, Dennis is my husband and if I forgive him, you should, too.
LEADFEMALE:Forgive him?
LEADFEMALE:Look, it's my marriage.
LEADFEMALE:I never should have come here.
LEADFEMALE:That was a big mistake.
OTHERMALE:We'll be out of here in the morning.
OTHERMALE:Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:What's going on? I'm sorry, but I have to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:Dennis told Kate he was sorry for what he did
SUPFEMALE:and they've made up.
SUPMALE:Marvelous.
SUPMALE:Get the hell out! Dennis had an affair.
LEADMALE:How could she forgive him? Dorothy, please, let me go back to sleep.
LEADMALE:I was dreaming I was being held captive on a desert island by Cesar Romero in a loincloth.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, Kate and I had a fight.
LEADMALE:I have to talk to you.
LEADMALE:You know that washcloth in my bathroom? That's how big Cesar's loincloth was.
SUPMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Ma!
LEADMALE:Alright.
SUPMALE:What did you and Kate have a fight about? About advertising condoms on TV.
OTHERMALE:About Dennis.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe she would go back to him.
LEADFEMALE:I told her it was a big mistake.
OTHERFEMALE:Who's asking you? It's none of your business.
LEADMALE:Kate came to me.
LEADFEMALE:She came to you to listen.
SUPFEMALE:You should stay out of it.
SUPMALE:I don't know what to do.
LEADMALE:Alright, alright.
SUPMALE:Sit.
LEADMALE:Listen.
OTHERMALE:Learn.
SUPMALE:Picture this.
SUPMALE:Brooklyn, July, 1949.
SUPMALE:Ma, put a sentence together.
LEADMALE:You sound like a sportscaster.
LEADMALE:Oh, shut up.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, it was the night of your first anniversary.
LEADFEMALE:You showed up at my house at two in the morning, crying.
SUPMALE:You looked like hell.
LEADFEMALE:You told me you had cooked an anniversary dinner for Stan.
SUPMALE:He came home late and there was lipstick on his shirt.
SUPFEMALE:You kept saying to me, "Ma, what should I do?"
SUPMALE:Remember what I told you?
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Thank God.
SUPFEMALE:What was it? I forgot.
SUPMALE:You said that if you could erase this one day, is this still the man you want to be with? And you said yes.
LEADFEMALE:I thought to myself, "Idiot", but I kept my mouth shut.
LEADFEMALE:I knew this was a decision you had to make.
SUPMALE:You're saying I should stay out of this mess between Kate and Dennis.
LEADFEMALE:I said it, used it in a story.
SUPFEMALE:You want me to embroider it on your underwear? Stay out of it! I don't know if I can do that.
LEADMALE:Then you're gonna lose Kate.
LEADFEMALE:And someday Stan is gonna call you up and tell you you have a grandchild who you're never gonna see.
OTHERFEMALE:Good night, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Not tonight, Cesar.
LEADMALE:I'm not in the mood anymore.
LEADFEMALE:That last episode of I Love Lucy was hilarious.
SUPFEMALE:It sure was.
LEADFEMALE:I never realized you could have that much fun staying up all night.
SUPFEMALE:Oh? Not even with Charlie? Oh, we never stayed up all night.
LEADMALE:Just seven till midnight and five to seven every morning.
LEADFEMALE:And, of course, till noon on Sundays.
LEADMALE:Lord, no wonder you still mourn that man.
LEADFEMALE:Morning.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:How are you doing? Much better.
LEADFEMALE:Ma and I talked and I know what I want to do.
LEADMALE:For once you'll keep your mouth shut.
SUPFEMALE:If I want things to be okay, I must get it off my chest.
SUPMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:You'll feel better, but you'll lose your daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, everyone.
OTHERFEMALE:How did you get in? The key under the mat.
SUPFEMALE:Do I smell waffles?
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Could I smell waffles? What does this look like? The House of Pancakes?
SUPMALE:So, how's Kate doing?
LEADMALE:Better than I am.
LEADMALE:Dennis is here and she's forgiven him.
SUPMALE:He's here? Somebody hold my hair.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna kill him! Oh, sit down and shut up.
SUPMALE:Good morning, everybody.
SUPMALE:Hi, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I hear that you and Dennis are back together.
SUPMALE:That's right.
OTHERMALE:We're leaving for the airport now.
SUPFEMALE:Kate, I want to say something.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? Not to you, to Dennis.
OTHERMALE:Dennis, I want to speak with you.
LEADMALE:Mother.
OTHERFEMALE:It's alright, Kate.
LEADMALE:Is your name Dennis? I have a right to be there.
LEADMALE:One sperm with a sense of direction and I pay for it for the rest of my life.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, I
LEADFEMALE:Please, Dennis.
LEADMALE:I just want you to listen.
LEADFEMALE:Yesterday, Kate came to me, crying.
SUPFEMALE:She was more hurt than I had ever seen her before.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy
OTHERFEMALE:Please.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to understand what that does to a parent.
SUPFEMALE:Seeing your child hurt is worse than any pain you can possibly feel yourself.
SUPFEMALE:When they're little, you protect them from the bullies on the playground, and then later you suffer with them through acne and puppy love.
LEADFEMALE:Then the first date, then the first time alone in a car.
LEADMALE:Finally they meet someone who will love them and take care of them and they don't need you.
LEADMALE:You're not thrilled, but you get used to it.
SUPMALE:And then something happens and you find out there's still bullies on the playground.
LEADMALE:And the old instincts come back.
LEADMALE:That's what happened yesterday.
SUPFEMALE:I know you have made up, but I still have the same feelings.
SUPMALE:Do you understand? Yes, I do.
SUPFEMALE:I did a very stupid thing that can't be undone.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to do everything to make it up to Kate.
LEADFEMALE:I love her.
LEADFEMALE:I promise you that nothing like this will happen again.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Because if it does, I will break every bone in your hand.
LEADFEMALE:You'll spend your life selling newspapers out of a wagon.
LEADFEMALE:Keep it zipped, buddy.
OTHERMALE:She's not kidding.
OTHERFEMALE:Dennis, is everything okay? Everything is fine.
SUPMALE:You'd better hurry.
LEADMALE:You'll miss your plane.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:If you're not doing anything around Memorial Day, visit us.
SUPFEMALE:How about me?
SUPFEMALE:Of course, Dennis.
SUPMALE:Of course.
SUPMALE:You're always included.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, you're hurting me.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye again.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, darling.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, I'm so glad things worked out.
OTHERMALE:Me too.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you're not a grandmomma, but you're still a darned good momma.
LEADMALE:Kate's gonna be a darned good momma too sometime.
OTHERMALE:How do you know? 'Cause it runs in the family.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess I'll be going, too.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Dorothy, out on the lanai out there, it was like old times.
SUPMALE:You and me, a team, united.
SUPMALE:Partners.
SUPFEMALE:It felt pretty good, didn't it? It sure did.
LEADMALE:Where did it go wrong, Dorothy? Oh Who knows? These things happen.
OTHERFEMALE:I remember.
OTHERFEMALE:I wasn't happy at home under the sheets.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, you're hurting me.
LEADMALE:I mean it.
LEADFEMALE:You're really hurting me.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Can I offer you more coffee?
OTHERFEMALE:No, thanks.
LEADMALE:Rod, we better go
LEADMALE:before we outstay our welcome.
LEADFEMALE:Too late.
LEADFEMALE:We certainly enjoyed having you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, right.
SUPMALE:Welcome to the neighborhood.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
OTHERFEMALE:Good night already.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, I cannot believe you, rushing them out of the house! Rushing? They took forever.
LEADFEMALE:Two hours to eat pasta and salad? Your father could eat dinner, read the paper, make love and have a pedicure in an hour.
LEADFEMALE:And without getting up from the kitchen table.
LEADMALE:I think they were delightful.
SUPFEMALE:I did too.
SUPFEMALE:So did I.
OTHERFEMALE:I just love to welcome people to the neighborhood.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, back home, I used to run our town's VÃ¤lkomm Wagon.
LEADMALE:Oh, boy, was that fun! Whenever a new family would move in to St.
SUPMALE:Olaf, we'd hop on the tractor and go to the neighbors' farm, carrying vats of smoked fish and big pitchers of freshly-squeezed potato juice.
LEADFEMALE:While Cousin Dat played "Getting To Know You" through the hole in his windpipe.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me, did you ever accompany him through the hole in your head?  Sophia, would you mind getting that, please? No problem.
SUPMALE:I'll drag my bad leg over to the door.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma'am, you shouldn't open the door
LEADFEMALE:without asking who it is.
SUPMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Who is it?
LEADFEMALE:Detective Mullins, Miami PD.
OTHERMALE:Please, come in.
SUPMALE:Please excuse my mother.
OTHERMALE:She's a little upset.
LEADFEMALE:She just found out she has the same hairdresser as Whoopi Goldberg.
LEADFEMALE:This is my associate, Bobby Hopkins.
LEADMALE:Detective Mullins, I am Blanche Devereaux.
LEADFEMALE:These are my roommates, Dorothy and Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:They're innocent.
SUPMALE:I am not.
LEADMALE:No, Bobby, you don't have to write that last part.
LEADMALE:That was just a come-on.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry to take up your time at this hour, but I'd like to ask some questions.
LEADFEMALE:I am single, I'm free Saturday night.
OTHERFEMALE:And I can arch my back until my head touches my heels.
OTHERFEMALE:If you don't mind, I'll write that down.
LEADFEMALE:Won't you sit down? I'd like to ask you about your neighbors, the McDowells.
SUPFEMALE:They're not who you think.
LEADMALE:You mean we invited the wrong people to dinner? In a manner of speaking.
SUPFEMALE:You see, your next-door neighbors are dealers in stolen gems.
SUPFEMALE:Those sweet people?
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid so.
SUPFEMALE:We think they'll be making a major move in the next 72 hours, so we'd like to set up shop here.
LEADMALE:Well, of course.
LEADMALE:You can both stay in my room.
OTHERMALE:Now, wait just a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, you can have the boy.
OTHERMALE:They can't just move in here.
LEADFEMALE:Let them do their work from a van, like real police on TV.
LEADFEMALE:We'd like your cooperation, but you have every right to say no.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:Um, girls, I think we need to discuss this.
OTHERMALE:Gentlemen, if you'll just excuse us for a moment.
LEADMALE:Ladies, I think we must do this.
LEADFEMALE:It's our duty as Americans.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:Two policemen living in our house? What's there to be afraid of? Once you strip away the gruff exterior, badge, gun and uniform You've got a naked policeman.
SUPFEMALE:Exactly.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, this is serious.
SUPFEMALE:If we can assist the police, we should.
LEADFEMALE:Their job is hard enough.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:My father was a policeman.
SUPFEMALE:Wasn't your father a farmer? On the weekdays.
LEADFEMALE:Saturday and Sunday, he and the other farmers became volunteer policemen.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, the only crime in St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf was that more people didn't practice better oral hygiene.
LEADMALE:Mostly they sat around the jailhouse and took pictures of each other behind the bars in goofy poses.
LEADMALE:I vote no.
LEADMALE:Well, I agree with Ma.
OTHERMALE:Why should we get involved in something that might be dangerous? If it was dangerous, they wouldn't let us get involved.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche has a point.
SUPFEMALE:And if anything happens, we've got the police right here with us.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you're right.
LEADFEMALE:OK, then, it's all settled.
OTHERFEMALE:They can stay.
LEADFEMALE:Detective Mullins, we decided you all can stay, so welcome to our home.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:We appreciate this very much.
LEADMALE:We'll be back tomorrow to set up.
SUPMALE:You won't have to change your lifestyles.
LEADFEMALE:We just need a bedroom and bathroom.
OTHERMALE:We'll use the kitchen as base.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:We'll just cook in the fireplace and pee in the broom closet.
SUPFEMALE:Al? Al!
LEADMALE:Yeah?
SUPMALE:How do you like the pasta? It's OK.
LEADMALE:I'm not that crazy about Italian food.
SUPFEMALE:Lucky for you you carry a gun.
LEADMALE:Excuse me? The last three days with you have really been fun.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Sophia.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Al.
LEADMALE:You hear anything on the wiretap yet? Save your breath.
SUPFEMALE:He can't hear a word.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I've been entertaining myself all afternoon.
SUPMALE:Watch.
LEADMALE:Hey, you dumb Bacciagaloop.
OTHERMALE:Your face looks like the rear end of a donkey.
OTHERMALE:This kills me.
OTHERMALE:You try it.
LEADMALE:No, I will not! I don't think you should talk to him like that either.
LEADMALE:He's practically your daughter's boyfriend.
LEADFEMALE:What? They hate each other.
LEADMALE:They fight all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Very passionate fights.
OTHERMALE:It has all the signs of a classic lovelhate relationship.
LEADMALE:From the sparks of that conflict rise the flames of desire.
SUPFEMALE:Flames that ignite in an uncontrollable frenzy of lust, passion and ecstasy.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Where was I? Oh, I don't believe this.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Dick Tracy
LEADFEMALE:What's your problem now? I said move this someplace else where it would not be in the way.
LEADFEMALE:I said I'd try.
SUPFEMALE:I tried.
LEADFEMALE:Would you also try to remember to put down the toilet seat after you use it? Sorry, that was me.
LEADMALE:I was experimenting with something but it didn't work out.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, he's only trying to do his job.
LEADFEMALE:It can't be very pleasant for him either.
SUPMALE:As far as stakeouts go, it's nice.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you couldn't hear with those on.
OTHERMALE:I do that for Sophia.
LEADMALE:She likes calling me names, so I let her.
LEADFEMALE:She's really a sweet lady.
OTHERMALE:She just doesn't like to show it.
LEADMALE:Is that a family trait?
LEADMALE:You won't believe what happened to me at the store.
LEADFEMALE:I saw the McDowells.
LEADMALE:Luckily, they didn't see me, so I followed them through the store and I wrote down everything they bought.
SUPMALE:Why? For evidence, silly! Rose, they steal jewels, not Geno's pizza rolls.
OTHERMALE:Ladies, listen to me now.
SUPFEMALE:I know it seems like we're in this together, but they're dangerous.
LEADMALE:Leave the police work to us.
LEADMALE:Ready for a break, Al? Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get some fresh air.
SUPFEMALE:Won't the neighbors see you? A gentleman visitor.
LEADMALE:But it'd look better with one of you.
LEADMALE:Come on, Dotty.
SUPFEMALE:"Come on"? If you want me to do you a favor, ask me.
SUPMALE:OK, don't bite my head off!
LEADMALE:You're a real charmer!
LEADFEMALE:Who are you? Lady Di? Do me a favor and join the bomb squad.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, God, I am crazy nuts about this guy!  Hi, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:It's Martha McDowell, your new neighbor.
SUPMALE:I was here for dinner, and yesterday you followed me
LEADMALE:around the supermarket.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my God! Why, Dorothy, look, it's, uh it's Mrs.
OTHERMALE:McDowell.
SUPMALE:Why is everyone staring at me?
LEADFEMALE:Your handbag and shoes clash.
LEADMALE:We're a very fashion-conscious neighborhood.
SUPFEMALE:It's short notice, but would you like to come to dinner tomorrow?  Oh, hello.
SUPFEMALE:We haven't met.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Martha McDowell from next door.
SUPMALE:Hi, Martha.
LEADFEMALE:You've met my son Alfonso and my grandson Bobby.
SUPFEMALE:They're here from New York on a fishing trip.
SUPFEMALE:All they've caught is a cold.
SUPMALE:Nice touch, but I work alone.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I've got to run.
SUPMALE:You let me know about dinner tomorrow night.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:That was quick thinking.
LEADFEMALE:No big deal.
LEADFEMALE:I mistake a lot of people for my grandson.
LEADFEMALE:She invited you to dinner?
LEADMALE:Yes.
OTHERMALE:Al
LEADMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:It's too dangerous.
OTHERMALE:We can break the case open.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about? We need a bug in their house.
LEADMALE:Bobby, it's not their job.
SUPFEMALE:We've got zip on the phone.
OTHERFEMALE:They're too smart.
LEADMALE:To get a warrant, we need a bug.
LEADMALE:I'll do it.
OTHERMALE:I'll be the plant.
SUPFEMALE:You are a plant.
LEADMALE:Rose, honey, you don't do too well under pressure.
SUPFEMALE:Remember the time in the coffee shop when you didn't have enough money? You ran into the ladies' and tried to climb out through the skylight.
SUPFEMALE:That doesn't happen anymore, since I switched to decaf.
LEADMALE:I would volunteer, but I'd be too conspicuous.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a dinner party and I plan to show cleavage.
SUPFEMALE:If anybody does it, it should be me.
SUPMALE:Why you?
SUPMALE:I am the best under pressure.
LEADFEMALE:And she bears a striking resemblance to Barnaby Jones.
LEADMALE:You've been tossing and turning all night.
LEADFEMALE:What's bothering you?
SUPFEMALE:Nothing, nothing.
LEADMALE:Don't you break a commandment.
LEADMALE:What commandment? Thou shalt not toss and turn?
SUPMALE:No, thou shalt not lie.
LEADMALE:That's not a commandment.
LEADFEMALE:Really? That doesn't make any sense.
LEADMALE:There's, "thou shalt not commit adultery," "thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.
OTHERMALE:" Two refer to hitting the sheets, and they couldn't fit in lying? Does anybody think before they write this down? You're not making sense.
SUPMALE:I can't talk to you when you're half asleep.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, it's 4am.
LEADMALE:Why don't you get a hose and whack me around until I'm razor-sharp? Ma, I have a problem.
LEADMALE:I'm worried about tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know whether or not I should go on that mission.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, for 50 years you've told me your problems.
LEADMALE:Who should I take to the prom? Should I marry Stan? These were things I could help you with.
LEADMALE:"Should I go on this mission?" is not my area of expertise.
OTHERFEMALE:Who am I, Oliver North? You're not making this any easier.
LEADFEMALE:All right, if you think it'll help land this Al character, do it.
LEADFEMALE:Al? Who said anything about landing Al? Do you think I'd risk my life for Al? I'm doing this because I think it's right.
OTHERMALE:Because I'm a concerned citizen.
LEADMALE:And I'd give my right arm to land Al! I'm scared.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:Your problem isn't unique.
SUPFEMALE:People do crazy things for love all the time.
LEADMALE:Let me tell you a story.
LEADMALE:Picture 
LEADMALE:Sicily, August 1908.
SUPFEMALE:No, that's not it.
SUPMALE:But if you ever need a story about jealousy, this is a pip.
OTHERMALE:Ma, just go to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:No, I remember.
LEADFEMALE:Havana, 1957.
LEADFEMALE:No, I was never in Havana.
SUPMALE:Ma!
OTHERFEMALE:I meant Brooklyn, 1958.
LEADFEMALE:No, that's not it.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm dry! I got nothing!
SUPMALE:It's OK, Ma.
LEADMALE:No, it's not.
LEADMALE:Tommy Lasorda should be standing by the bed, waving to the bullpen.
LEADMALE:Ma, don't let it bother you.
LEADMALE:I just can't leave you hanging.
SUPMALE:Would you settle for a very wise observation? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Al's a good guy, and he makes you happy.
SUPMALE:If you're doing it for that alone, it's worth it.
LEADMALE:You're also doing it because you feel it's the right thing.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:That means a lot to me.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Now, get some rest, pussycat.
SUPMALE:Tomorrow could be your last day.
LEADFEMALE:It's a shame we have to go to the McDowells' tonight.
OTHERMALE:There's a great movie on TV.
SUPFEMALE:What? In Cold Blood.
SUPFEMALE:It's about This innocent family is brutally murdered
OTHERFEMALE:May I see that, Rose?
SUPFEMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, we're nervous enough about going over.
LEADMALE:Do you have to make it worse? Well, it's nothing to be nervous about.
LEADFEMALE:Bobby and Al are watching through the window the whole time.
LEADFEMALE:If we get in trouble, we just signal them.
LEADFEMALE:How are we doing, ladies? To be honest, we're a little nervous.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go over the plan once more.
LEADFEMALE:Check.
LEADFEMALE:At 1800 hours, we enter the suspects' domicile.
LEADMALE:At 1830 hours, we sit down to dinner.
LEADMALE:After wine is poured at approximately 1840 hours, I begin telling the story about Uncle Hertis and the skunks,
LEADFEMALE:which should last about
LEADMALE:1900 hours.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, here's the transmitter.
LEADFEMALE:Keep it in your hand.
LEADMALE:Then, with one quick movement, stick it under the table.
OTHERFEMALE:That's it.
OTHERMALE:All right, so, any other questions? Well, I guess that's it.
LEADFEMALE:Good luck.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you're not going.
LEADFEMALE:I am.
LEADFEMALE:If anything goes wrong,
LEADFEMALE:you need someone experienced.
SUPMALE:In what? Life.
LEADMALE:You're looking at a woman who lived through two wars, 15 vendettas, four operations and two Darrins on Bewitched.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think those are very good reasons to go.
OTHERMALE:No? How about this one? I'm hungry.
OTHERMALE:Let's roll, Danno.
SUPFEMALE:Al All right, that's the front door closing.
LEADMALE:Yeah, the ladies are out of the house.
LEADMALE:The transmitter's working perfectly.
LEADFEMALE:Clear as a bell.
LEADFEMALE:They did it.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:I had doubts about this one.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:Congratulations.
SUPFEMALE:Great job.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:It's really working?
SUPMALE:Give her the phones.
LEADMALE:I hate to say this, but it was almost fun.
OTHERFEMALE:Fun? My pulse was racing, my heart was pounding! I could barely get my breath! That's the most fun I've ever had standing up! No, I take it back.
OTHERFEMALE:There was that one time on that 74 7.
LEADMALE:They keep talking about the noodle-head in the red dress.
SUPFEMALE:Could that be code? Only to the noodle-head in the red dress.
LEADMALE:OK, what happens next? We should get enough to get warrants and be out of your lives by tomorrow.
LEADMALE:I'm beat.
LEADMALE:I'm going to bed.
LEADMALE:Me too.
SUPMALE:Boy, I'm too excited to sleep!
LEADFEMALE:You're not.
OTHERMALE:You're beat too.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'm beat too.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so beat, I won't be able to hear a thing that goes on.
LEADMALE:But I'd like to hear about it tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Give me the earphones.
LEADFEMALE:Get some rest.
LEADMALE:OK, Al.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Dorothy, I just wanna say you did a nice job.
SUPMALE:Thanks, Al.
LEADFEMALE:And Dorothy I also wanted to say it took guts.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, Al.
SUPMALE:You see, Dorothy, I just wanted to ask you I wanted to ask you  For God's sakes, he wants to ask you to go out with him! You got your listening equipment, I got mine.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Come in.
SUPFEMALE:Bobby, here's those extra towels you asked for, honey.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:You're welcome.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, thank you for everything you've done the past few days.
OTHERMALE:You don't have to thank me for anything.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, I kind of enjoyed doing it.
LEADFEMALE:You remind me a lot of my son, Matthew, except he doesn't carry a gun.
LEADMALE:Bobby, does your momma know you carry that gun? Blanche, I'm a grown man.
LEADMALE:I don't need her permission.
SUPMALE:Although, to be honest, she's not thrilled about it.
LEADFEMALE:That's because she loves you.
LEADFEMALE:I'd be a nervous wreck if Matthew were a police officer.
SUPFEMALE:I worry about him enough, and he's a CPA.
LEADFEMALE:I guess that's just a mother's nature.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'll see you in the morning.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Blanche, listen, uh My mom's in Oregon.
LEADMALE:I don't get a home-cooked meal too often.
LEADMALE:OK if I stop by sometime? I think that would be great.
SUPMALE:I don't care how old you think you are
LEADFEMALE:it's light's out.
LEADMALE:Yes, ma'am.
LEADFEMALE:OK.
LEADMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Bobby, let's go! The exchange is going down! Move it!
LEADFEMALE:What's going on?
LEADMALE:It's the McDowells.
LEADMALE:Get on the floor and stay there! Now! 
SUPFEMALE:I'm scared!
SUPMALE:I'm scared too! I'm scared for Al and Bobby.
LEADFEMALE:Shh! What was that noise?
LEADMALE:That was me.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for calling it to everyone's attention.
LEADFEMALE:Oh What's happening out there?
LEADFEMALE:Shut up.
LEADFEMALE:I hear something.
SUPMALE:I don't.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Gunshots! Oh, sweet Jesus! That could have been Al! We have to do something.
SUPFEMALE:We have to wait till he comes back.
SUPFEMALE:What if he can't come back?
SUPFEMALE:Thank God you're OK!
SUPFEMALE:Is everything OK? Just stay down.
LEADMALE:It's Mullins.
SUPFEMALE:I need an ambulance at the stakeout.
OTHERMALE:My partner's shot.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! Yeah, at first I was really scared, but then I realized it was a shoulder wound and calmed down.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, I passed out.
LEADMALE:But I did it calmly.
SUPMALE:Bobby, you're so brave.
SUPMALE:You're so stupid! You're supposed to duck a bullet.
LEADFEMALE:In Sicily, you don't pass kindergarten till you learn that.
LEADFEMALE:Really? In St.
LEADMALE:Olaf, we just had to promise not to eat paste.
SUPMALE:All right, ladies, let's not baby him.
LEADFEMALE:Al, how are you doing?
OTHERMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:The DA will put away the McDowells for a long time.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, who's going to look after their lawn? Rose, while we're here, maybe you should have a CAT scan.
LEADMALE:Come on, Bobby, out of bed.
LEADMALE:You've got to go out to the sun deck.
LEADFEMALE:Who wants to drive?
LEADMALE:I'll do it.
OTHERFEMALE:It's nice not to be a passenger for a change.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to tell me the whole story from the beginning.
LEADMALE:From the time that you left Dorothy I want to ask you something.
LEADMALE:How about you and I go out sometime, huh? Dorothy, I want to see you again.
SUPMALE:I want to see you again too.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:But I can't.
OTHERFEMALE:Why not? Because I could get serious about you.
OTHERMALE:I don't get it.
LEADFEMALE:Al, until the other night, I thought this whole thing was a game, but after what happened, I realized it isn't.
LEADMALE:You don't want to become involved with someone who could get hurt.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Al.
LEADMALE:It's not the first time I've heard it.
LEADMALE:I understand.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:You take good care of yourself, you hear? Yeah.
LEADMALE:So, are you two an item?
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, we decided it was best
SUPFEMALE:if we didn't see each other.
LEADMALE:Are you sure, Dorothy?
OTHERFEMALE:In your heart, are you sure?
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Ma.
LEADMALE:Fine, then I want you to meet someone.
OTHERFEMALE:Dr.
LEADMALE:Tansy This is my daughter.
OTHERMALE:And this guy is nobody.
LEADFEMALE:Beat it, Al.
OTHERFEMALE:
SUPMALE:I got the ice.
SUPFEMALE:Haven't you finished the hors d'oeuvres yet?
LEADMALE:I'm doing the celery sticks.
LEADFEMALE:Did you finish the decorations? No, not yet.
SUPMALE:I kinda got sidetracked.
LEADMALE:Look!  This is what you've been doing for 45 minutes? Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't he cute? I call him Scotty.
LEADMALE:Now you can call him garbage.
SUPMALE:Help Blanche with the hors d'oeuvres.
LEADMALE:What time's the birthday girl getting here? Roberta will be here at two.
LEADFEMALE:Does she suspect anything?
LEADFEMALE:Please! The woman is 88.
LEADMALE:She still tries to find Gunsmoke on Sunday nights.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, get the cake and we'll take these in.
LEADMALE:Good idea.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, where's the cake?
SUPMALE:Rose, did you take it?
SUPMALE:I haven't even seen it yet.
SUPMALE:Ma, where's the cake?
SUPFEMALE:I haven't seen it yet, either.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean? You were supposed to bake it! I was?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma! You forgot!
LEADMALE:I didn't forget.
SUPFEMALE:I wanted it to be fresh.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll bake it now.
SUPMALE:Roberta will be here in 45 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have time.
SUPMALE:and knit you a sweater! Out of my way.
LEADMALE:The maestro approaches the podium.
LEADMALE:Gee, I hope Sophia finishes in time.
SUPMALE:You can't give a good birthday party without a cake.
SUPFEMALE:I recall a party with three cakes that was not so terrific.
LEADMALE:Three? Rose had planned a surprise birthday party for me.
LEADFEMALE:You were still living at Shady Pines.
LEADMALE:You mean the home.
LEADFEMALE:Say it, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:The home.
LEADMALE:Anyway, Rose had planned this surprise birthday party for me.
LEADMALE:I'll never forget it.
LEADFEMALE:I've never had such a surprise in my life.
LEADFEMALE:? Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you ? Happy birthday boys and girls ? Happy birthday to you ? Welcome to Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha Ha's Hot Dog Hacienda!  I have lots of fun planned for you.
OTHERMALE:But finish your Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Ha Ha dog first because ? A Ha Ha dog is fun to eat ? A Ha Ha dog is really neat ? A Ha Ha dog is a great big treat ? And it's only $ 1.
LEADFEMALE:79 without a beverage ? Wooh! See you soon, kids!  Isn't this fun?  Dorothy, you haven't even touched your Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Ha Ha dog.
SUPFEMALE:You're right.
OTHERMALE:There, I touched it.
OTHERMALE:You're not having any fun, are you, Dorothy? Am I that transparent? You're the one who always complains that her birthday parties are boring.
OTHERFEMALE:When I saw Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Ha Ha's on TV, it looked like fun.
LEADFEMALE:For a five-year-old, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Or someone who thinks like one!
OTHERFEMALE:I've ruined your birthday.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, you haven't.
LEADMALE:You haven't ruined it.
LEADMALE:Yes, I have.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a big dope.
SUPMALE:You must hate me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, come on now, don't cry.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, I don't hate you! I'm really having fun.
LEADMALE:It's just that it took me a little while to get into the spirit of things.
LEADFEMALE:Seriously?
LEADMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Both Blanche and I are having a lot of fun.
OTHERFEMALE:Aren't we, Blanche? Who wouldn't have fun eating a foot-Iong Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Ha Ha dog? And drinking a 32-ounce Cherry Burpy.
SUPMALE:If you drink three, you get to keep Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Ha Ha's hat.
SUPMALE:If you drink three, you should get to keep Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Ha Ha's kidney!  Guess who's back?  Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Ha Ha! That's right! Now it's time for the Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Ha Ha birthday roundup! When I call your name, please come up on stage.
LEADMALE:Bobby Spina! Please say you didn't do this, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:[Mr.
SUPMALE:Ha Ha] Jeannie Taylor!
OTHERMALE:Please tell me you didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy Zbornak!
OTHERMALE:Dorothy Zbornak!
LEADFEMALE:Stop that! You're making a fool of yourself.
SUPMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha Ha's looking at you.
LEADMALE:Are you Dorothy Zbornak?
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Get up on stage, Dorothy!
LEADFEMALE:Get bent, Ha Ha! Come on, kids.
SUPMALE:Let's give Dorothy a great big Ha Ha cheer!
LEADMALE:Ha Ha!
LEADMALE: Dorothy! Dorothy! Dorothy! Dorothy! Dorothy! Dorothy! Dorothy! Dorothy! Dorothy! Dorothy! Dorothy! Dorothy! Dorothy! Dorothy!  It says here on my Ha Ha birthday list that Bobby is seven Jeannie is nine, and Dorothy is I'll punch your heart out, Ha Ha.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy is the oldest! And, as the oldest, you get to lead the birthday parade! Here is your parade leader's hat.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Music, if you please.
LEADFEMALE: Don't prolong this.
LEADMALE:I know what car you drive.
SUPFEMALE:The parade's over! Let's hear it for all the birthday boys and girls!  But the fun's just about to begin.
LEADFEMALE:Because it's time for your Ha Ha hot fudge cake! Free to all my birthday boys and girls.
LEADFEMALE:Only $1.
LEADFEMALE:98 to the rest of you.
LEADMALE:No, thank you.
LEADMALE:I've had enough.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh! I think we have a cranky birthday girl! You see, kids, when you get a little older, you can get a little cranky.
OTHERMALE:And when you get as old as Dorothy, you can be a real pain in the Ha Ha.
LEADFEMALE:So, Dorothy, lighten up, enjoy your cake and make a wish, OK? Come on, kids.
SUPFEMALE:Make a wish and blow out the candles.
LEADFEMALE:I hope everybody gets what they wished for.
SUPMALE:Do you really, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Ha Ha? Dorothy, if I were you, I'd put the cake down.
OTHERFEMALE:You see, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Music's brother is Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Lawyer.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, that's not a very adult thing to do.
SUPMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:I can't do it.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Ha Ha?
LEADMALE:Yes, Bobby? Happy birthday, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry I missed that one, but I was At the home.
SUPFEMALE:We know, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:How's the cake coming, Sophia? Beautiful.
LEADMALE:I got everything.
LEADFEMALE:Coconut, eggs, unbleached flour, rum.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you making a rum cake?
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Gee, I love to bake.
SUPFEMALE:In St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf, I baked our birthday cakes.
LEADFEMALE:Charlie loved 'em.
SUPFEMALE:I remember the last cake I baked in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf.
SUPFEMALE:It was kinda different.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my birthday! I completely forgot! Well! I'd better make a wish and blow out those candles before Mr.
SUPMALE:Hickenlooper has the volunteer fire brigade up here pumping water on my clean kitchen floor.
LEADFEMALE:I swear, that man will look for any excuse to make that siren sound through his nose.
OTHERFEMALE:Inga Lundqvist told me just this last week I know.
LEADMALE:Shut up, Rose, and blow out your candles.
LEADMALE:OK.
LEADMALE:A wish.
LEADMALE:I guess that was kind of a silly wish.
LEADFEMALE:I know you can't really be here with me, Charlie.
LEADFEMALE:It's taken me these past eight months to accept that, but I finally have.
LEADMALE:Then why our usual little private birthday celebration? It somehow feels less Ionely, Charlie.
SUPMALE:I mean, this is the first special day I've had to spend without you.
SUPMALE:If it had been Christmas, I'd have hung your stocking.
OTHERMALE:Or if it had been your birthday, I probably would have still asked the clerk down at Tuttles to help me pick out a tie for you.
LEADFEMALE:I bet that would have gotten me some strange looks from the sales staff.
LEADFEMALE:Although they already look at me strangely.
LEADFEMALE:Because of the time I tried to special-order a double-breasted suit with a drop-seat in the pants for cousin Wendell.
LEADMALE:Anyway, that was part of the reason.
LEADFEMALE:The other part was I wanted to talk to you.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I didn't need a special occasion for that.
SUPMALE:It would be more of an occasion if I stopped talking.
LEADMALE:But I I figured since it was my birthday, you wouldn't be upset when you hear what I've got to tell you.
LEADFEMALE:I've decided to sell the house and leave St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf, Charlie.
SUPFEMALE:The winters are rough here in Minnesota.
LEADMALE:And this place is too filled with memories to let me get on with my life.
OTHERMALE:I need to start over without you, Charlie.
LEADMALE:And I think this is the best way.
LEADFEMALE:I know it'll be tough in a strange town all alone.
OTHERMALE:But I've read some wonderful things about Miami.
SUPMALE:It won't be long before I meet nice people and make some new friends.
LEADMALE:I have a real good feeling about that.
SUPFEMALE:So I just wanted you to know what I decided.
LEADFEMALE:I hope to be in Florida before the next winter comes.
OTHERMALE:But I know that wherever I am, you'll be right there with me.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, Charlie.
LEADMALE:I miss you.
OTHERMALE:It's my birthday! You know the rules.
SUPMALE:I get the rose.
OTHERFEMALE:and a pinch of baking soda.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, that looked like an awfully big pinch.
OTHERFEMALE:Who cares? Sophia, maybe you should sit down.
LEADFEMALE:I am sitting.
LEADMALE:You know, I'm gonna make you a nice pot of coffee.
LEADFEMALE:Don't panic, I'm fine.
OTHERMALE:I haven't had that much.
LEADMALE:Besides, you think I'd ruin Roberta's milestone birthday?
LEADMALE:Milestone? She's 88.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:After 80, every year without a headstone is a milestone.
LEADFEMALE:I think my milestone birthday was when I turned 50.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma, I remember your 50th.
SUPMALE:We were meant to go to a party at Guido's, but you fought with Pop.
SUPFEMALE:I'll never forget it.
LEADMALE:It was Brooklyn, April, 1956.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, I tell the stories around here.
SUPFEMALE:Picture 
LEADMALE:Brooklyn, April, 1956  Fine! If that's the way you feel! Sophia, I'm staying right here!  Fine! Stay there forever, you big Bacciagaloop!
OTHERFEMALE:I curse the day I met you!
LEADMALE:Doubled! Ma, it's me, Dorothy!
LEADFEMALE:Happy birthday, Ma.
SUPMALE:Ah, shut up!  You're welcome.
LEADFEMALE:You'll be late for your birthday party.
SUPFEMALE:Stan's in the car.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean? What do I have to celebrate? A miserable marriage and leaving my husband?
LEADFEMALE:You had a fight.
LEADFEMALE:You love to show off that college education, don't you? OK, why are you mad at Pop? Because your father is a miserable, no-good, insensitive bum!
SUPMALE:I heard that!
LEADMALE:Good, then hear this! May you lose the three hairs left on your head!  Oh, yeah? May you lose your tweezers so your eyebrows meet to cover the wart on your forehead! That's not a wart, that's a beauty mark!  On Sophia Loren, it's a beauty mark! On you and Khrushchev, it's a wart! Pop, enough! Come out of the bedroom now!  Not while she's there.
LEADMALE:She hit me.
SUPFEMALE:Ma!
LEADMALE:With a piece of bread.
LEADMALE:Five days old! Like a jack handle! He deserved it for how he wished me a happy 50th.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talking about? You're 48.
LEADMALE:That's what I thought.
SUPMALE:But last night, during Your Show Of Shows, he hands me papers he found.
SUPFEMALE:He says they made a mistake on my birth certificate when I came into this country and I'm actually 50! So what's the difference? You're 50.
LEADMALE:What's the difference? I gave him the best years of my life and he just stole two more! I've never been so depressed.
SUPMALE:Oh, Ma, it doesn't mean anything.
SUPFEMALE:You don't understand, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I always had plans, dreams, things I wanted to accomplish by the time I was 50.
SUPMALE:What kind of dreams?
LEADMALE:Well for one thing, I always wanted to be a ballerina.
LEADMALE:Please! With those legs? Come on out, Salvadore, I've got more bread waiting for you! I've got news for you.
LEADFEMALE:It wouldn't have been easier to break into ballet at 48.
LEADMALE:But I'd still have two more years to dream.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm 50! I'm an old lady who hasn't accomplished a thing in life.
LEADFEMALE:You haven't accomplished a thing? You raised three kids during the Depression and always managed to have food on the table.
SUPMALE:You had two jobs as far back as I can remember, but were always there when we needed you.
LEADFEMALE:You got me through college, by helping pay for it, and by encouraging me when I felt like giving up.
LEADMALE:Do you want me to go on, Ma? We could be here all night.
SUPFEMALE:Enough.
LEADMALE:Ralph Edwards makes less of a fuss over people.
SUPMALE:I'm tired of this old lady business! You're acting like an ass! You don't look 50.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't look 48.
OTHERMALE:You're as beautiful as the day I married you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Salvadore! Tell me that again.
SUPMALE:You're acting like an ass! He's right.
LEADMALE:Salvadore, open the door.
SUPMALE:We have a birthday party to go to.
SUPMALE:Ma! Pop, come on.
SUPMALE:You'll be late for the party.
LEADMALE:Er we'll be there in about an hour, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Oh, Salvadore!  Dorothy! Er make that two hours! Wow.
SUPMALE:Happy birthday, Ma.
LEADMALE:Actually, we never got to the party at all.
LEADFEMALE:There were a lot of disappointed people.
SUPFEMALE:I wasn't one of them.
LEADMALE:Neither was your father, if memory serves me correctly.
LEADFEMALE:Is this cake ready? Roberta's gonna be here any minute.
SUPFEMALE:It's ready when it's ready.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, she won't be surprised anyway.
LEADMALE:Surprise birthday parties never work.
LEADMALE:Yeah? What about the surprise party we threw for you when we first moved in? That worked.
SUPFEMALE:Almost.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it kind of worked.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Rose, I picked up Blanche's birthday cake.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing?
LEADMALE:Decorating Blanche's cake.
OTHERFEMALE:There, it's finished.
LEADMALE:I said I would get the cake! I know, but where I come from, most people won't eat store-bought.
SUPMALE:Rose, where you come from, most people live in windmills and make love to polka music.
LEADMALE:Stop it, Dorothy, you're making me homesick.
SUPFEMALE:We're coming! Who could that be? Everybody I invited is already here.
OTHERMALE:Sophia!
OTHERFEMALE:Ma! What are you doing here? You shouldn't leave the home.
OTHERMALE:You're recovering from a stroke! What recovering? I'm back 100, knock wood.
SUPMALE:Come in! Just listen.
SUPMALE:We are throwing a surprise birthday party for Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Go out to the lanai
LEADMALE:and mingle with the guests.
OTHERFEMALE:Check.
LEADFEMALE:What's a lanai?
LEADFEMALE:The porch! Excuse me, Krystle Carrington! Blanche is gonna be surprised! It's lucky I found out today's her birthday.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, what's wrong?
LEADMALE:Nothing.
LEADMALE:I want to take a bath and forget about today.
OTHERMALE:Oh, OK.
LEADFEMALE:No! Girls, we haven't lived together very long, but when I come home mad and say nothing's wrong, you have to draw what's wrong out of me.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, what's wrong? Nothing.
LEADMALE:OK.
SUPMALE:Oh, all right, quit badgering me! I didn't want to tell you this, but today's my birthday.
LEADMALE:Today's your birthday, Blanche? Today? Dorothy, did you hear that? Today is Blanche's birthday!
LEADMALE:And I hate birthdays.
LEADFEMALE:And she hates birthdays.
LEADMALE:The only thing worse is surprise parties.
SUPMALE:What did I get at work today? A surprise birthday party.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I was so upset I almost threw up.
LEADMALE:Did you hear that, Dorothy? Surprise parties make Blanche want to throw up.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, go and take that bath.
OTHERMALE:We'll just forget the fact that today is really your birthday.
LEADMALE:Well, I don't see how anybody can hate birthdays.
LEADMALE:Well, because they are constant reminders that with each year our bodies begin to sag, our faces begin to wrinkle, our hair begins to turn gray.
LEADMALE:Of course, none of that's happened to me yet.
LEADFEMALE:But it's only a question of time until I look like you two.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, keep that up, you won't have that much time left.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I'm here for your surprise birthday party.
LEADFEMALE:My what? What? You didn't.
SUPMALE:Of course we didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, there's no party.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I should take you home.
LEADFEMALE:Am I Frances Farmer? I know there's a party out there! Blanche, I guess we made a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:Look, we'll cancel the party.
LEADFEMALE:We'll forget that the whole thing ever happened.
LEADMALE:Whoa, everybody! The party's off! They want us out! But you're welcome to come back to my place.
LEADFEMALE:If someone can tell me where it is.
LEADMALE:Roger! Edgar! Burt! Leland! Well, what are they all doing here? I invited everybody in your address book.
OTHERFEMALE:The little red one by my night stand? No, the little black one next to your hot body oil dispenser.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, fellas.
LEADMALE:No need to rush off like this.
SUPFEMALE:It is my birthday.
OTHERFEMALE:Who wants to be the first one to spank me? Boy, that turned out to be some evening, didn't it? It sure did.
SUPFEMALE:From that night on, I learned to love surprise parties.
OTHERMALE:It reminded me of a party in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf, as a little girl.
SUPFEMALE:Big Sven and Little Sven were celebrating the first anniversary of their smoked herring hoagie house, when Big Sven
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it!  It's my cake.
LEADMALE:I'll get it.
OTHERMALE:Ma, that looks like a cookie.
OTHERMALE:You put too much rum in it.
SUPFEMALE:Stick an umbrella in it and serve it with straws.
SUPMALE:Everyone will think they're at Trader Vic's.
OTHERMALE:Let's take it in.
LEADMALE:Roberta will be here any minute.
LEADMALE:I hope she's surprised.
SUPMALE:The best part of a birthday is being surprised.
SUPFEMALE:Surprise! What?
LEADMALE:Happy birthday, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:But but my birthday's not till next week.
LEADFEMALE:We know.
LEADMALE:But you said last time we'd never be able to surprise you again.
OTHERFEMALE:It was the only way to do it.
LEADMALE:You did a great job.
SUPMALE:I don't know what to say.
LEADFEMALE:Say it's conga time!
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:I wish Mr.
OTHERMALE:Fix-It would finish fixing that dishwasher.
LEADMALE:The dishes are piling up like crazy.
LEADMALE:Blanche, we could wash them.
LEADFEMALE:Before dishwashers, people didn't just eat and wipe the dishes on their pants.
SUPFEMALE:I used to love washing dishes.
LEADMALE:In Minnesota, the whole family would get together and wash dishes.
LEADFEMALE:Even Uncle Gustaf, after the giant Swiss army knife accident, learned to dry dishes with his feet.
OTHERMALE:We used to laugh and have such a happy time.
LEADFEMALE:What is it with you? You only had happy times? It's sickening.
LEADFEMALE:Happy times freezing in the cold, happy times during a locust invasion, happy times eating reindeer.
LEADMALE:Death? Did you have happy times then? Well, yes, actually, we did.
LEADFEMALE:We could get together and remember other happy times.
OTHERFEMALE:She's beginning to get to me.
LEADMALE:Ma.
SUPFEMALE:In Sicily, we washed our dishes in the river.
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:I hope that's Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Fix-It.
LEADMALE:We used to beat them against the rocks.
LEADFEMALE:No, Sophia.
SUPMALE:You beat the clothes on the rocks, not the dishes.
LEADFEMALE:No wonder they broke.
LEADMALE:Okay, who wants to go shopping? It's early for that, Renee.
SUPFEMALE:Then we'll eat.
SUPFEMALE:Shopping or eating.
OTHERMALE:Take your pick.
SUPFEMALE:You didn't talk to him.
LEADMALE:I couldn't.
LEADFEMALE:George was on call all weekend.
OTHERMALE:Three heart attacks, a stroke, two aneurysms and a spastic colon.
SUPMALE:Sounds like a guy I play checkers with.
LEADMALE:Hi, Renee.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:You'll talk to him tonight?
SUPMALE:I will try.
LEADFEMALE:Renee.
LEADFEMALE:It's crazy, but how can I bother him? He's doing all this important stuff.
SUPMALE:Saving lives.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna bother him because I'm unhappy? Renee, Jenny just left for college.
OTHERFEMALE:All your kids are gone.
LEADMALE:This is a perfectly legitimate problem.
LEADFEMALE:Empty-nest syndrome.
LEADMALE:When I had it, I didn't know it.
LEADMALE:I was depressed.
LEADMALE:When I figured it out, I was gonna tell Charlie, but he died that night.
LEADMALE:I was so full of grief, I forgot to be depressed about the empty nest.
LEADMALE:I never had that empty-nest depression.
LEADMALE:I couldn't wait for my kids to go.
OTHERMALE:I got depressed watching them grow older 'cause it meant I was older.
LEADMALE:They were like noisy little calendars.
SUPMALE:The minute they entered high school, I told everybody they were my husband's from a previous marriage.
LEADMALE:And you wonder why they're in therapy.
LEADMALE:Maybe I should go into therapy.
SUPFEMALE:At 2am, waiting for George to come home, I called a radio talk show with a solution to the Middle East crisis.
LEADFEMALE:Giving the Palestinians Greenland? You heard it? I didn't know that was you.
LEADMALE:You were great.
OTHERFEMALE:Giving the Palestinians Greenland? It's a big place.
SUPMALE:Nobody uses it.
SUPFEMALE:You'd take desert people and put them in ice and snow? With the proper clothes, they'll be fine.
SUPMALE:Renee, listen, you wanna talk, don't call a talk show.
LEADFEMALE:Talk to your husband.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, at the hospital they call him St.
LEADFEMALE:George.
SUPMALE:I'm married to a saint and I tell him to work less, I'm Ionely? Don't you think St.
LEADMALE:Francis of Assisi's wife had a similar problem? Don't you think she said, "Frank, enough donkeys"? So what, I ask George to cut back on his practice? Don't do that.
LEADFEMALE:I can't go to another doctor.
SUPFEMALE:See? George is the only man to ever see me naked.
LEADFEMALE:Get outta here.
LEADMALE:Well, except for Charlie, of course.
SUPMALE:Get outta here.
LEADMALE:And the vet.
OTHERFEMALE:The vet? Our prize hen, Henrietta, had some kind of a chicken disease or something.
LEADMALE:I don't exactly know what it was.
LEADFEMALE:Chickenpox.
LEADMALE:No, I don't think so.
LEADMALE:I had an earache, so he saw us both at the same time.
OTHERMALE:For that you got naked?
LEADFEMALE:I thought it was strange, too.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Dorothy, you're right.
LEADMALE:I've got to talk to George.
LEADMALE:Good girl.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go home and tell him.
SUPFEMALE:I'll cook breakfast for him.
LEADMALE:He loves waffles.
OTHERMALE:No, I'll tell him at dinner.
SUPMALE:Dinner's better.
LEADFEMALE:He won't be rushing.
LEADFEMALE:I'll make something great.
SUPFEMALE:I'll tell him in bed.
SUPFEMALE:Bed's better.
SUPMALE:It always works.
LEADMALE:Asleep.
LEADMALE:I'll tell him when he's sleeping.
LEADFEMALE:Renee! I sound like a wimp.
LEADFEMALE:I can't possibly tell him.
LEADMALE:If I can talk about my stool sample, you can say you're Ionely.
SUPMALE:Leonard, help me out here.
SUPMALE:Where on that diet I gave you does it say creamed chipped beef and Polish sausage are okay to eat? Leonard, you're 5'6", you weigh 300Ibs.
SUPMALE:What do you mean you can carry it? Bekins couldn't carry it.
SUPMALE:Make an appointment for tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:We'll talk about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:Goodbye, Leonard.
OTHERFEMALE:Chuck.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a multiple personality.
LEADMALE:How do you know which of me I am? Because Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Fix-It and Boris use a key.
LEADMALE:Ah.
OTHERFEMALE:We all live in one body.
LEADMALE:Why don't they let me use the key? Isn't there medication at the home? No, doctor says I don't need it anymore.
LEADFEMALE:It doesn't stop the personalities.
LEADMALE:It just relieves anxiety.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not anxious.
OTHERFEMALE:I make other people anxious.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Chuckie.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, sis.
LEADFEMALE:You're over here early.
SUPMALE:I'm looking for an apartment.
SUPFEMALE:Doctor says I can get my own place.
LEADMALE:Oh!
SUPMALE:Who can afford three bedrooms? Can I go upstairs and see the dog? Sure.
SUPMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Renee, we don't have a dog.
OTHERMALE:If he thinks we do, who am I to stop him? Maybe we have one.
OTHERMALE:Maybe he sees things we don't have the power to see.
SUPMALE:I read that.
LEADFEMALE:People with mental illnesses are the chosen.
LEADFEMALE:Who chooses them
OTHERMALE:Shirley MacLaine?
OTHERFEMALE:George, we gotta have a talk.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:We have marital problems.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Hello, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Schecter.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that is good news.
LEADFEMALE:Great news.
LEADMALE:I'm very happy for you.
LEADMALE:Congratulations.
SUPFEMALE:Goodbye, Mr.
LEADMALE:Schecter.
SUPMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Schecter peed.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:He's 97.
SUPFEMALE:We're both very relieved.
LEADFEMALE:A catheter's no fun.
LEADMALE:So, what do you think? I'd be thrilled to pee at his age.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:What about our marriage?
SUPFEMALE:I'm worried about us.
SUPFEMALE:What? We're great.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think we're great.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Rose, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Come on in.
SUPMALE:Sit down.
OTHERMALE:We're sorry to barge in.
LEADMALE:Is Mr.
LEADMALE:Fix-It here?
LEADMALE:Chuck is here.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, darn.
LEADFEMALE:Could he change into Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Fix-It? It's a mental illness, Rose, not a masquerade party.
LEADFEMALE:A guy in Sicily had a multiple personality.
LEADMALE:They didn't get along.
SUPFEMALE:One personality put out a contract on the other.
LEADFEMALE:He had a shoot-out with himself in the piazza.
LEADMALE:He winged a priest, a waiter and shot down the Cinzano sign.
LEADFEMALE:He was able to beat himself senseless before anyone else got hurt.
LEADMALE:I rewired your phone.
SUPFEMALE:You can call all over the world for free.
LEADMALE:Except for Albania and North Korea.
SUPFEMALE:And you can use your TV remote to flush the toilet.
LEADMALE:I'm going to the freeway, see if any cars need help.
SUPFEMALE:This guy knocks me out.
LEADFEMALE:Chuck, could you finish our dishwasher first? I'm not Chuck, I'm Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Fix-It.
LEADFEMALE:Here to please.
SUPFEMALE:No problem too big or too small.
SUPMALE:This is great.
SUPFEMALE:It's better than vaudeville.
SUPMALE:I'm all ears, ladies.
OTHERFEMALE:Lead me to the trouble.
SUPMALE:There's nothing I can't fix.
LEADFEMALE:Except this noggin.
OTHERMALE:That could use rewiring.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:We don't want to lose him.
LEADMALE:I'd better get to the office.
LEADFEMALE:We're not done.
LEADMALE:Couldn't it wait?
SUPMALE:No, it cannot wait.
SUPMALE:The kids are gone, you're never here.
OTHERFEMALE:I have nothing to do anymore.
SUPFEMALE:What do your friends do?
LEADFEMALE:Shop, lunch.
SUPFEMALE:Some play golf, some have affairs.
LEADMALE:Which ones are having affairs?
SUPMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, I'll never tell.
OTHERMALE:The ones who are happy for no reason.
LEADMALE:George, my life is empty.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you get a job? I thought of that.
SUPMALE:I could go back to show business.
LEADMALE:Renee, you were the legs in the dancing cigarette box.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody loved me.
OTHERFEMALE:I brought joy to people.
SUPMALE:You sold cigarettes.
SUPFEMALE:You brought cancer to people.
LEADMALE:No matter what you think, I'll try to get work in the entertainment business.
SUPMALE:But that's just my part.
LEADFEMALE:You've got a part, too.
LEADFEMALE:You've got to be here more.
OTHERFEMALE:You never complained before.
LEADMALE:The kids were here.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't notice.
SUPFEMALE:But, George, time is important now.
OTHERFEMALE:With them gone, we're supposed to be together in a new way.
LEADFEMALE:It was on a coffee commercial.
LEADMALE:I think Taster's Choice.
SUPMALE:This couple
LEADFEMALE:we're supposed to be like that.
OTHERMALE:Like what?
SUPMALE:Like this couple.
OTHERMALE:They're there, just the two of them, sipping coffee together, for as long as they have left.
LEADMALE:Must be one hell of a cup of coffee.
SUPFEMALE:I'm in real trouble here, George.
OTHERMALE:Our marriage is in trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Describe the pain.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Okay, meet in my office.
SUPMALE:Yes, right now.
LEADMALE:I gotta go.
LEADMALE:I got a sick person.
LEADMALE:See you later.
LEADMALE:I love you.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, too.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, a movie will cheer you up.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you seeing?
SUPFEMALE:Nightmare On Elm Street 4.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have to see the others? No, Rose, it stands alone.
SUPMALE:Hi, everybody.
OTHERFEMALE:Jenny! Jenny, what are you doing home from school?
SUPMALE:You're sick? You're pregnant?
LEADFEMALE:I quit.
LEADFEMALE:Thank God.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you'd be mad.
LEADFEMALE:I am.
LEADMALE:I'm also glad you're not pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, why did you quit? I went to be with my boyfriend, but he was practically living with somebody else.
OTHERFEMALE:He'd replaced me.
SUPFEMALE:With what? A hand puppet, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, I am so sorry.
SUPFEMALE:You shouldn't have gone to Columbia University.
LEADMALE:It's in New York City, for heaven's sake.
LEADMALE:A subway runs right through it.
LEADFEMALE:You want to go where there are green lawns and willow trees and young men in chinos and ties and professors with just a touch of gray at the temple.
SUPFEMALE:Wise, learned men who look up your skirt if you're in the first row.
OTHERMALE:Meetings with them so they can explain Plato.
SUPFEMALE:And they lean over your books with you and you can smell their pipe tobacco and their maleness.
LEADFEMALE:Then their arm accidentally brushes against your bosoms and the room is filled with the heat of a taboo lust.
LEADMALE:Where is this school? Jenny, what happened?
SUPFEMALE:He met a thin, blonde goddess.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:One of those girls who has everything, you know.
SUPMALE:Looks, money, brains, a body, and now my boyfriend.
LEADMALE:Honey, I've been in that position more than once.
LEADFEMALE:You've been in every position more than once.
LEADFEMALE:My position?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, goodness, no.
LEADFEMALE:The goddess' position.
LEADMALE:We have our problems, too.
LEADFEMALE:Especially when the goddess is now twice the size.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, I know what you're feeling.
LEADMALE:Everyone's been rejected.
LEADMALE:And, honey, the loss of your first love is the worst, the very worst.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I remember mine.
OTHERFEMALE:It was probably a cow.
LEADMALE:How on earth did you know that, Sophia? Wild guess.
LEADFEMALE:Mine was Larry Raganetti.
SUPMALE:Oh, how I loved him.
SUPFEMALE:He was gorgeous.
LEADMALE:He left me for Cookie Kelly.
LEADFEMALE:She kissed with her mouth open.
SUPFEMALE:Why not kiss with your mouth open? I was eight.
LEADFEMALE:So? It's happened to all of us, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:We've all survived.
LEADFEMALE:Never happened to me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:You were never rejected?
LEADFEMALE:Well, once.
SUPMALE:But just once.
SUPFEMALE:By who? Weight Watchers for being too thin.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, girls.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for coming over.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye, honey.
SUPMALE:
SUPMALE:Hi, George.
SUPMALE:Hello.
OTHERMALE:Bye, George.
SUPMALE:Hi, George.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia.
LEADMALE:Hi, George.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, George.
LEADMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Sweetheart! Oh!
LEADMALE:What are you doing home?
LEADMALE:She's not sick or pregnant.
LEADMALE:Is it Thanksgiving already?
LEADFEMALE:Dennis dumped me.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Sugar, I'm so sorry.
SUPMALE:I wish I could say something to make you feel better.
OTHERFEMALE:What if I said I hated him?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Daddy.
SUPMALE:I know how much it hurts, darling.
LEADFEMALE:But you know, I've been rejected many times.
OTHERMALE:So has your daddy.
LEADFEMALE:I can't go back.
OTHERMALE:I can't.
SUPMALE:I just can't.
SUPMALE:What if I run into them? I'll die of embarrassment.
LEADMALE:No, you won't.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a doctor and I've never seen anyone die of embarrassment.
SUPFEMALE:If it'll make it easier, I'll go with you and help get you settled.
LEADMALE:Will you?
LEADFEMALE:Absolutely.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Oliver.
SUPMALE:You wanna know who I spent the night with?
LEADFEMALE:No, Oliver.
LEADMALE:The cabin crew of Lufthansa.
LEADMALE:I have to go?
OTHERMALE:You're 18.
SUPFEMALE:You don't have to.
LEADMALE:We won't force you.
SUPMALE:We'll cut you off without a dime and never talk to you again.
OTHERMALE:So you strongly recommend.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:I owe you a beer.
SUPFEMALE:I'll make some calls
LEADMALE:and see some friends.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you going?
LEADFEMALE:Back to school.
SUPMALE:Flying?
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You'd be safer hitching.
SUPFEMALE:Oliver, don't start.
LEADMALE:I'm a test pilot.
LEADMALE:I know what goes on.
LEADFEMALE:I don't need to hear this.
OTHERFEMALE:Or what goes on in the cockpit.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, come on.
SUPMALE:Goodbye, Oliver.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:Poor kid.
LEADMALE:But we did the right thing.
LEADFEMALE:Absolutely.
SUPFEMALE:You really think so?
LEADMALE:I don't know.
OTHERMALE:George, would you take a look at this? This is a family discussion, Oliver.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, that's nice.
SUPFEMALE:I wish I had a family.
OTHERMALE:I think it's skin cancer.
LEADMALE:It's not.
OTHERMALE:We're right.
OTHERFEMALE:She has to go back.
SUPMALE:If she actually dies of embarrassment, I'll never forgive myself.
LEADMALE:So, what is this thing?
LEADMALE:A liver spot.
SUPFEMALE:Oh-ho-ho, no.
SUPMALE:Oh-ho-ho, God.
LEADFEMALE:A liver spot?
LEADMALE:It's benign.
LEADFEMALE:My father had liver spots.
SUPMALE:He looked like a Dalmatian.
LEADMALE:So, what's this family talk about, guys?
SUPMALE:It's private, Oliver.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I see.
SUPFEMALE:So would you please excuse us?
LEADMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Get out of my house!
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you mean go?
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Why didn't you say? Bye, guys.
SUPMALE:You know something?
LEADFEMALE:What's that?
LEADFEMALE:Oliver! What?
OTHERFEMALE:We were great with Jen.
LEADFEMALE:We were.
OTHERMALE:We were a team.
LEADFEMALE:George, I want us to be a team.
SUPMALE:Does that mean we should get uniforms? Come on, George.
SUPFEMALE:It means that we did something together and it felt great.
LEADFEMALE:We've gotta do that without the kids, but you're never here.
SUPFEMALE:What do you want me to do?
LEADFEMALE:Cut back on your practice.
OTHERFEMALE:Do I tell a guy in cardiac arrest, "Sorry, meeting my wife for sushi"? George, do you know why I'm going to New York with Jenny? Not just to help her.
LEADMALE:To be with someone who needs me.
OTHERMALE:Think about it.
LEADMALE:Think about that.
LEADFEMALE:I've got the second half of my life to take care of.
SUPMALE:And I don't want to do it alone.
SUPFEMALE:Then Renee calls and says she's got an agent.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, nice.
SUPMALE:Not nice, Oliver.
SUPFEMALE:Within six days she has an agent who'll get her commercials.
LEADMALE:Who knows what the hell she'll do? It'd be funny if she never came back.
SUPMALE:This house is so empty without her.
LEADMALE:I'm Ionely.
OTHERMALE:That's why I never got married.
LEADMALE:I didn't want to be Ionely.
LEADMALE:And I didn't want somebody else driving my car.
OTHERMALE:You're out of Perrier.
OTHERMALE:This is what Renee was talking about.
LEADMALE:She was Ionely.
LEADFEMALE:You're out of beer and peanut butter.
LEADMALE:Hell, George, get her back.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna starve to death.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:What a nice surprise.
LEADFEMALE:For you maybe.
OTHERMALE:George, I wanted to talk.
LEADFEMALE:Do I detect a note of hostility? A note? How about a symphony? We thought you might like to join us for dinner.
OTHERMALE:I get the feeling you might be mad at me.
SUPMALE:Why? How about stopping by New Year's Eve with three naked women, throwing up in the pool, passing out in the punchbowl, and relieving yourself in the linen closet? That was six months ago.
SUPFEMALE:George, what do you say?
LEADFEMALE:We'd really love to have you.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe some other time.
LEADMALE:What about forgive and forget, Dot? I am not "Dot".
LEADMALE:Goodbye, George.
SUPFEMALE:Goodbye, Dot.
LEADMALE:Where are you going?
LEADFEMALE:New York.
SUPMALE:Great, let's do it.
LEADMALE:You're not invited.
SUPMALE:I'm going alone.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but we could Hi, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, how'd you like to have Come on, that was three or four months ago.
SUPMALE:Coming.
LEADFEMALE:Thank God.
SUPMALE:I was a wreck.
LEADFEMALE:I sat there every night with Oliver, Ionely as hell.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know what was going on.
LEADFEMALE:I thought, "What if I lose her? What would I do without her? I want her here with me and I want to be there with her.
LEADFEMALE:" So, here I am.
SUPMALE:And there's going to be some changes.
OTHERMALE:And I love you.
OTHERMALE:Why the hell are you opening a door without saying, "Who's there?" I wasn't going to stay here, George.
LEADMALE:I missed you.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't stand it.
LEADFEMALE:And I realize I've been going too fast for you.
LEADMALE:You can't change overnight.
LEADMALE:I'd like to try.
OTHERMALE:Here's step one.
SUPMALE:I drew a sketch on the plane.
LEADFEMALE:I've decided to make an office in the house and move my practice there.
LEADFEMALE:No?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:And I got Maz Lansky to take part of my patient load.
LEADMALE:I got him to take it all for three days while we're here on our second honeymoon.
SUPMALE:George, I love you.
LEADMALE:I love you, too.
OTHERFEMALE:But, honey, this isn't our second honeymoon.
LEADFEMALE:It's our third?
LEADFEMALE:We never had one.
LEADFEMALE:Of course we had one.
SUPMALE:George, you were an intern.
LEADMALE:Two hours in a hospital bed next to a man in a coma isn't a honeymoon.
SUPMALE:I lied.
OTHERFEMALE:He wasn't in a coma.
LEADMALE:Oh!
LEADMALE:What if I make it up to you?
LEADFEMALE:How? Oh, George.
OTHERFEMALE:What a great three days.
LEADFEMALE:This has been a wonderful honeymoon.
LEADMALE:It should be.
LEADMALE:You waited long enough.
SUPFEMALE:Mm.
OTHERMALE:You think we'll stay like this always? I think eventually we'll have to go to the bathroom.
OTHERMALE:And you'll love me always?
LEADMALE:Always.
OTHERFEMALE:Because I won't always look like this.
LEADFEMALE:Honey.
LEADMALE:You don't look like you did ten years ago.
SUPMALE:Promise me you'll never get your teeth bonded and go with stewardesses.
OTHERFEMALE:I promise.
OTHERMALE:You swear?
SUPMALE:I swear.
LEADFEMALE:I love you.
OTHERFEMALE:I love you too, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:George.
LEADMALE:Hm? Promise me one more thing.
SUPFEMALE:What? Promise me you'll never die.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Here Blanche, you can add this to the pile.
SUPMALE:You're not serious.
LEADMALE:You're not giving this dress to the rummage sale.
LEADMALE:This is the best looking outfit you own.
LEADMALE:You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:I still look damn good in this thing.
SUPMALE:Well, I don't know about "damn good.
LEADFEMALE:" That design does tend to accentuate your behind while simultaneously diminishing your cleavage.
OTHERMALE:Wait just a minute.
LEADFEMALE:First you tell me this is my prettiest outfit, then you tell me I don't look very good in it.
LEADMALE:Now, which one is the truth? Both.
SUPFEMALE:Look on the bright side, honey.
SUPFEMALE:How often do you get out of your robe on the weekends? I finished loading the cartons into the car.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thank you Daisy, darling.
LEADMALE:It's very sweet of you to give up your Saturday to help with this fundraiser.
LEADMALE:That's what being a Sunshine Cadet is all about.
LEADMALE:I know, I so admire your 
LEADMALE:"Spread it around.
LEADFEMALE:" That's sunshine, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:"Spread sunshine around.
LEADMALE:" Whatever.
SUPMALE:Daisy, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Nylund put some things out on her bed.
SUPFEMALE:Would you bring them in here?
LEADFEMALE:Sure, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Devereaux.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Ma, where you going?
LEADFEMALE:Down to the boardwalk.
OTHERMALE:I like to sit and watch the old guys rearrange themselves when they come out of the water.
LEADMALE:Where are you going? I'm off to the rummage sale.
OTHERMALE:Would you like a ride? No, I wanna do cartwheels for six miles.
LEADMALE:Get your keys, let's roll.
LEADMALE:Here are Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Nylund's things.
SUPMALE:Put them here.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe she's giving away this teddy bear.
SUPFEMALE:I wish I could afford to buy him at the sale.
LEADMALE:You like him?
LEADFEMALE:I think he's the cutest thing I've ever seen in my whole life.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then I'm gonna give him to you.
LEADFEMALE:He's yours.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank you, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Devereaux.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you! Thank you! You're welcome.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Nylund.
SUPMALE:Hi, Daisy.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, Daisy.
LEADFEMALE:That was Daisy, wasn't it?
SUPMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:She's been helping out the entire time you've been gone.
SUPFEMALE:It's just so inspiring, the way those Sunshine Cadets volunteer for community service.
LEADMALE:You know, back home, we didn't have a community organization for females.
OTHERMALE:Unless you count Miss Maggie's house on the hill.
LEADMALE:Those girls would stand on their heads for you.
LEADFEMALE:Course I heard that cost you ten bucks extra.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche! Have you seen my teddy bear, Fernando? He's missing.
OTHERFEMALE:I've had him since I was six years old.
SUPMALE:I have to find him.
SUPMALE:I just have to.
SUPFEMALE:Calm down.
LEADMALE:He's just a toy.
LEADMALE:Fernando is not just a toy.
SUPMALE:He's a family heirloom.
SUPMALE:I've had him for as long as I can remember.
SUPMALE:I don't know what I'd do without him.
SUPMALE:Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, now don't panic.
LEADFEMALE:Look, we'll find him.
LEADMALE:All we need is a logical plan.
OTHERMALE:You go check out the attic and I'll look around outside in case he wandered off.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:I feel better now.
LEADFEMALE:At least we have a plan.
SUPMALE:Someone sitting here? Cataracts or glaucoma? I can see there's no one sitting here.
OTHERMALE:I was just being polite.
LEADFEMALE:If you say so.
LEADMALE:Me, I've got both.
LEADMALE:Cataracts and glaucoma.
LEADMALE:The glaucoma I handle with drops.
LEADFEMALE:For the cataracts, I had surgery.
OTHERFEMALE:They used laser beams on me.
LEADMALE:Zap, zap.
OTHERMALE:Just like that.
LEADFEMALE:No more cataracts.
LEADMALE:Dynamite.
LEADMALE:You black? Laser beams, huh? Gimme a break, you geezer.
LEADFEMALE:The sun's reflecting off the sand.
SUPMALE:Who you calling an old geezer? What am I, Kreskin? How should I know what your name is? If you didn't have your eyes zapped with some ray gun, you could read it off my identification badge here.
LEADFEMALE:"Alvin Newcastle.
SUPFEMALE:Security guard.
SUPFEMALE:" That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't you just buy the one that says, "Marshal, Dodge City.
LEADFEMALE:" This happens to be a legitimate, officially authorized identification badge.
LEADMALE:Issued by the police department direct.
LEADFEMALE:And I happen to be a legitimate for real security guard.
LEADMALE:Well, you're doing a great job, Alvin Newcastle.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody stole the boardwalk since you've been sitting here.
LEADMALE:Just forget it.
LEADFEMALE:It's my fault for trying to be friendly.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go back to counting seagulls.
LEADMALE:So where do you work? A bank, a department store? Ocean Mist Retirement Hotel.
LEADFEMALE:Sundays, noon to one.
SUPFEMALE:Ocean Mist.
LEADFEMALE:You know Molly Feinberg? I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, you mean Molly Feinbaum.
SUPFEMALE:I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
LEADMALE:Ocean View, not Ocean Mist.
LEADMALE:Finestein, that's it.
SUPMALE:Gray hair, glasses.
LEADMALE:Or is it Ocean Spray? Well, that's a cranberry juice.
LEADMALE:Definitely Ocean Terrace.
OTHERFEMALE:Definitely Feinstein.
LEADFEMALE:Except she pronounces it "Feinstine.
LEADFEMALE:" Harriet Feinstein.
LEADMALE:You want me to say hello for you? Would you mind? We're very close.
LEADMALE:No problem.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Alvin.
LEADFEMALE:I have an enormous veal and pepper sandwich here.
LEADMALE:I couldn't possibly finish it.
LEADMALE:You want half? I made it fresh this morning.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds more interesting than the tangerine I got.
LEADMALE:Prepare yourself for a real treat.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:I don't even know your name.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia.
OTHERFEMALE:Sophia Petrillo.
LEADMALE:Italian? Take one bite of the sandwich and you tell me.
SUPMALE:Hey, I didn't hear you get up.
LEADFEMALE:I never went to sleep.
LEADMALE:Now look, Rose, this has to stop.
LEADFEMALE:Now you have been carrying on for a week.
LEADMALE:It was only a toy animal.
SUPMALE:Fernando was more than that.
OTHERMALE:He was full of life, he was full of love He was full of stuffing, Rose.
SUPMALE:Now look, you've got to get a grip on yourself.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I know I'm behaving like a fool.
LEADMALE:But I got a right to sing the blues.
SUPMALE:I lost my teddy.
LEADFEMALE:I understand, Rose.
LEADMALE:Which, if I thought about it, says something deeply disturbing about me.
OTHERMALE:"I've got a right to sing the blues"? Dorothy, I hope you didn't fix breakfast for me.
LEADMALE:I'm not eating home this morning.
SUPFEMALE:Someone's buying me breakfast.
LEADFEMALE:Someone?
OTHERMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Quit badgering me.
LEADMALE:It's Alvin.
OTHERFEMALE:Alvin from the boardwalk? No Rose, Alvin from the Chipmunks.
SUPFEMALE:Girls, guess what I found.
LEADMALE:Fernando.
LEADFEMALE:That's not Fernando.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean, "that's not Fernando"? How could you tell? All you have to do is look in his eyes.
LEADMALE:Or at the price tag stuck to his back.
SUPFEMALE:Oops!
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for trying, Blanche.
SUPMALE:It's nice to know I have a friend like you who cares.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:I have a confession to make.
SUPMALE:Rose didn't lose Fernando.
SUPMALE:I gave him to Daisy when she was helping out with the rummage sale.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, there's no problem, honey.
OTHERMALE:Just call Daisy and get Fernando back.
SUPMALE:She's a very sweet kid.
LEADFEMALE:She'll understand.
LEADFEMALE:I tried that.
LEADMALE:She said no.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? She's not a sweet kid anymore.
OTHERMALE:She's holding Fernando for ransom.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, she sent me one of his ears.
OTHERFEMALE:I think I got one.
OTHERMALE:Where? Past the lifeguard stand.
SUPFEMALE:Bald guy about 20 yards out?
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah, watch his face.
LEADFEMALE:Huh? Am I right? You got one, no doubt about it.
LEADMALE:That gentleman just peed in the ocean.
OTHERFEMALE:How many is that today? Three? Four? I'm not sure.
LEADMALE:I lost track.
LEADMALE:Whatever.
LEADMALE:My point is, there's always something interesting happening at the beach.
SUPFEMALE:But then again, I've always been a beach person.
LEADFEMALE:Not my Salvador.
SUPMALE:Salvador?
OTHERFEMALE:My husband.
LEADMALE:You have a husband? Departed, I told you about him.
OTHERMALE:Anyway, Salvador hated the beach.
OTHERFEMALE:He said too many people peed in the ocean.
OTHERFEMALE:What about your Edna? Edna? Did she like the beach?  You ever notice the birds? I'm asking you about your late wife, you're asking me about birds? At the park, they want you to feed them, but here they take care of themselves.
LEADFEMALE:Here they could die for clams casino, what's your point? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I'm asking about Edna.
LEADMALE:Edna?
OTHERFEMALE:Your wife.
SUPMALE:Oh, hey.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, I I guess I just can't take a hint.
OTHERMALE:There's some things about Salvador I still have trouble talking about.
SUPMALE:Of course, other things I'm not allowed to talk about unless I want the Scarpoli family to put out a contract on me.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I I made up that last part, trying to lighten the moment.
OTHERMALE:I I'm sorry, Alvin.
SUPFEMALE:Don't cry.
LEADMALE:That's okay.
LEADFEMALE:You cry all you want.
SUPFEMALE:Daisy, honey, be reasonable.
SUPMALE:Now why won't you give the bear back? Because he belongs to me.
LEADMALE:He does not belong to you, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:No, he belongs to Rose.
LEADMALE:She gave him to me.
LEADMALE:But honey, I had no right to do that.
OTHERFEMALE:You mean, you made a mistake? Yes, that's all it was, just a silly mistake.
SUPMALE:In Sunshine Cadets, we learn you have to pay for your mistakes.
SUPFEMALE:This one's gonna cost you a ten-speed Schwinn.
SUPFEMALE:Daisy.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't the Sunshine Cadets teach you anything about honesty and decency and respect for your elders? I think that was scheduled for the weekend campout at Lake Wakatake.
OTHERMALE:I missed it, when I was grounded for catching a smoke in the boys' john.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, we're shafted.
OTHERFEMALE:Think you could have the bike by this weekend? Listen, Daisy, I don't like being intimidated, I do not like being threatened and frankly, kid, I don't like you.
LEADFEMALE:I am not gonna buy you anything, and I am going to tell your folks what you're doing and then I'm going to call the school for bad girls and they will come and pick you up and put you in a sack and take you away and you will never eat ice cream or play jump rope again.
OTHERMALE:Get real, grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Either way, I'll get the bike.
LEADFEMALE:My folks will feel terrible because two mean old ladies forced me to return my toy.
SUPMALE:And because it was ruined in the accident on the way back to their house.
OTHERFEMALE:Accident?
LEADFEMALE:See this water pistol? It's loaded with red ink.
LEADMALE:Hi, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, don't move.
SUPFEMALE:She's got the teddy bear and a water pistol.
SUPFEMALE:What? Rose, it won't sound any less ridiculous if you hear it again.
LEADMALE:You found my teddy.
LEADFEMALE:Where was he?
LEADMALE:You didn't tell her?
OTHERFEMALE:Tell me what? I think the price just went up.
SUPMALE:I'll get back to you within 48 hours.
OTHERMALE:What's going on? Where did she take Fernando? She took him home, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, see, honey, Fernando doesn't exactly belong to you anymore.
LEADMALE:I kind of gave him to Daisy by mistake.
LEADFEMALE:Get him back.
OTHERFEMALE:I want my teddy.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, she's just a child.
LEADMALE:You can't expect a child to give back a toy.
OTHERFEMALE:Now you do understand, don't you? Just cut the crap and get back the damn bear.
LEADFEMALE:Where you been? Know what time it is?
LEADFEMALE:9:00.
LEADFEMALE:In your dreams.
SUPFEMALE:You take the wrong bus again? Never mind, you didn't miss anything.
SUPFEMALE:What do you think you're doing?
LEADFEMALE:I think I'm crocheting but to tell you the God's honest truth, I wouldn't swear to it.
SUPMALE:This is my seat.
LEADFEMALE:You're sitting in my seat.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me, I didn't know your I sit in this seat every day.
LEADMALE:You got no right sitting in my seat.
SUPMALE:Relax! I'm moving.
LEADMALE:You're always doing this kind of thing.
SUPMALE:You're never thinking about anybody but yourself.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about.
OTHERMALE:I didn't take the wrong bus.
SUPMALE:That dumb-ass driver went the wrong way.
SUPMALE:A different way, and you know it! What the hell's the matter with you? Alvin.
LEADFEMALE:Alvin.
LEADMALE:Morning, Sophia.
SUPMALE:What are you doing? I'm levitating, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:Get lost.
LEADMALE:Aw, come back here.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't deserve that.
LEADMALE:You're a good kid.
OTHERMALE:I'm just a little depressed.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? You know, I'm depressed too.
SUPMALE:What are you depressed about? Alvin and I had a fight.
SUPFEMALE:I'm making a scarf for a friend I don't have anymore.
LEADMALE:I know exactly how you feel.
LEADFEMALE:I made these for Fernando.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you broke up with that midget.
SUPFEMALE:Fernando's not a midget.
LEADFEMALE:He's my oldest and closest friend.
LEADMALE:I didn't know Alvin long but I thought we were getting close.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe he just walked away.
LEADMALE:Fernando was always there for me.
LEADFEMALE:Whenever I was scared or down about something, I'd just roll over and snuggle up against him in bed.
LEADFEMALE:I never went to bed with Alvin.
LEADFEMALE:The thought never crossed my mind which is odd because I've always wondered about that myth.
SUPMALE:There's a myth about people named Alvin? The myth about black men in the bedroom.
LEADMALE:Is that a Greek myth?  Get the door, Rose.
LEADMALE:You.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning.
LEADMALE:Well, kid, what do you want? I changed my mind.
LEADMALE:I was wrong to ask for all those gifts.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, you see, I knew she'd come to her senses.
LEADFEMALE:I decided cash is better.
LEADFEMALE:That way I can buy exactly what I want.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get my purse.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, I'm not gonna let you do that.
LEADFEMALE:I've been doing a lot of thinking and if after all the years of love and companionship Fernando and I are meant to part company I'll just have to accept that.
LEADMALE:Time to time, life deals you an unfriendly hand.
LEADMALE:There's nothing you can do about it.
LEADFEMALE:I guess there's a lesson to be learned here.
SUPMALE:Sometimes, life just isn't fair, kiddo.
LEADMALE:Morning.
OTHERFEMALE:Alvin.
SUPFEMALE:Am I sitting in the right place? Depends.
SUPMALE:If you looking to catch a bus to Jacksonville, you could be in big trouble.
LEADMALE:You old geezer, you know what I'm talking about.
LEADFEMALE:Half the time I suspect you don't know what you're talking about.
SUPMALE:Especially when you start all that muttering in Italian.
LEADMALE:I swear, you make up half those words.
LEADMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:I brought you this.
LEADMALE:Because you're sorry? Because I'm thirsty and I figured you might be too.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever.
LEADFEMALE:They're really quite a pair, aren't they? Excuse me? My father and your mother.
SUPFEMALE:They sit like that all day, every day.
LEADFEMALE:He's even started referring to my husband as "that dumb badgagaloop.
LEADMALE:" How did you How'd you know that she was my mother.
SUPFEMALE:Just a guess.
LEADMALE:From the way you were watching.
SUPFEMALE:After what happened yesterday, I thought you might show up.
LEADFEMALE:He told you about the fight? No, I saw it.
LEADFEMALE:I was here.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, there doesn't seem to be any problem now.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you said this was a cold drink.
LEADFEMALE:It's lukewarm.
LEADFEMALE:I told him no ice.
SUPFEMALE:You dumb badgagaloop.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think makes it cold? Your attitude is making me cold, woman.
SUPMALE:So lighten up and say thank you.
LEADMALE:All right, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:What? Thank you for the soda.
LEADFEMALE:I guess we're even.
LEADMALE:This fight was my fault.
LEADMALE:Yesterday was yours.
SUPFEMALE:Yesterday? Hey, if you're willing to forget about it, so am I.
LEADMALE:He has his good days and he has his bad days.
OTHERMALE:You just never know what to expect.
SUPFEMALE:No, I understand.
OTHERMALE:My mother can be the same way.
SUPMALE:I guess it's just part of getting older.
LEADMALE:Some of it.
LEADFEMALE:But my father isn't going to get any better.
LEADMALE:He's only gonna get worse.
LEADFEMALE:So that's when the salesman from men's sportswear walks clear across the store into lady's petite and says, "Excuse me, Miss.
LEADFEMALE:I notice you've been having a hard time deciding between the turquoise strapless and the flaming red backless.
OTHERMALE:Well, personally, I would like to see you in the backless.
LEADMALE:" And I said, "When?" And he said, "How about Saturday night?" And I said, "How about in your dreams, sleazo?" Can you believe the nerve of that guy? What were you doing in lady's petite? 
LEADFEMALE:Ma?
SUPFEMALE:Come in.
SUPFEMALE:I'm glad you're home.
SUPMALE:Got a minute?
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Crochet me a scarf.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, I need to talk to you about Alvin.
SUPMALE:He's sick, Ma.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? You've never seen him.
LEADMALE:I've seen him, Ma.
OTHERMALE:After you had that fight, I was worried about you and I followed you to the boardwalk.
LEADFEMALE:That was you? Thank God.
LEADMALE:I thought Gino the Enforcer was out on parole.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, please.
LEADFEMALE:Will you let me say what I have to say? Maybe I don't want to hear what you have to say.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I'm happy not knowing anything.
LEADFEMALE:Or maybe you know already.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not stupid.
SUPMALE:I could see there was something that wasn't right.
LEADMALE:Ma, he has Alzheimer's disease.
LEADFEMALE:I met his daughter down at the boardwalk.
SUPFEMALE:She said that when he first started wandering off, she followed him everywhere.
LEADFEMALE:She took a leave of absence from her job to take care of him.
OTHERFEMALE:But she's not gonna be able to afford that much longer.
LEADMALE:Uh, the family's discussed sending him to New York.
SUPMALE:He has a nephew who's a doctor there and can give him special care.
LEADFEMALE:And Ma, Sandra says that within the next couple of months, they're gonna do that.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Dorothy, people think if you live to be my age, you should be grateful just to be alive.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's not how it works.
LEADFEMALE:You need a reason to get up in the morning.
OTHERMALE:And sometimes even after you find one, life can turn right around and spit in your face.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, Ma.
OTHERMALE:A few months, huh? That should give me enough time to finish the scarf.
LEADMALE:Ma? Dorothy.
SUPMALE:How long have you been here? A while.
SUPFEMALE:He's not coming back, is he? No.
OTHERMALE:It was a nice couple of months.
SUPMALE:I'll miss him.
LEADFEMALE:Think he'll remember me? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I'll remember him.
LEADFEMALE:I finished the scarf, you know.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:Next time we go to New York, maybe you'll take it to him.
LEADMALE:Nah, I think I'll mail it.
LEADMALE:That way, I'll always picture him right here on the boardwalk.
LEADMALE:Hey! Someone's sitting there!
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Rose.
OTHERMALE:We brought dinner.
SUPMALE:What'd you get?
LEADFEMALE:A bucket of chicken.
LEADMALE:I hope you like it extra flat and crispy.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a pizza, Rose.
SUPMALE:I knew that, I just meant what kind?
SUPMALE:Did you really know that?
SUPFEMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:But I thought I could cover.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad you're all here.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to try something.
LEADMALE:Here, taste this.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think?
LEADMALE:It's water.
LEADMALE:I didn't ask you to identify it, I asked you what you thought.
SUPFEMALE:It's good.
SUPMALE:Just good? Very good.
SUPFEMALE:How would you describe the taste?
OTHERMALE:Refreshing, clear, clean
SUPMALE:Would you buy this water?
LEADFEMALE:Sure, why not?
LEADMALE:Absolutely.
SUPMALE:We're rich.
LEADMALE:We're rich.
LEADFEMALE:It comes from the hose out back.
LEADMALE:Move over Perrier, Petrillo water is on the way.
SUPMALE:Ma
OTHERFEMALE:I know what you're gonna say.
LEADFEMALE:Another one of my get-rich-quick schemes.
SUPFEMALE:This is different.
LEADMALE:I've been working on this since noon.
SUPMALE:Ma, when are you gonna learn that these money-making gimmicks of yours never work? I'm not the only one with dreams.
LEADFEMALE:I remember when we thought catering was the ticket.
LEADFEMALE:Do you remember that?  Girls, this time I think we have really hit the jackpot.
OTHERMALE:Oh, me too.
SUPMALE:This wedding consulting business is the smartest thing we've ever done.
LEADMALE:I'm a little nervous about tomorrow.
SUPMALE:I've never cooked for 300 people.
SUPFEMALE:Please, in Sicily, we did it all the time.
SUPMALE:And we didn't have the modern conveniences you have today.
OTHERFEMALE:We had to slaughter our own meat, prepare our own seasonings, and, if the food wasn't perfect, after cappuccino, they shot the cook.
SUPMALE:Ma, you're making that up.
LEADMALE:No, I'm not.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you think there are only two guys from Italy?  Oh, places everybody.
SUPFEMALE:Hit it.
SUPMALE:You know, this is boring.
OTHERFEMALE:I know how we could make the time go faster.
LEADMALE:We could sing a work song, like they do on the railroad.
SUPFEMALE:Just follow my lead.
LEADMALE:Gonna stuff a chicken   Gonna stuff a chicken  Like my mama taught me   Like my mama taught me  Gonna take the chicken down to Mississippi  Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, just stuff it.
SUPFEMALE:Who on earth could that be at 3:00 in the morning? Maybe it's a Jehovah's Witness with a caffeine problem.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we should go see.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we should have a weapon.
LEADFEMALE:Please, the three of you without make up is enough to scare anyone.
LEADFEMALE:Who is it?
SUPMALE:It's Priscilla.
LEADMALE:Priscilla? Priscilla! You're getting married tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:You should be in bed.
LEADFEMALE:There's not gonna be a wedding.
LEADFEMALE:The hell there isn't.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, dear, you were saying? Ramone and I had a fight.
LEADFEMALE:I decided I'm not gonna marry him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, now that's ridiculous to call off your wedding because of a silly little argument.
OTHERFEMALE:What did Ramone do?
OTHERMALE:He slept with my best friend.
LEADMALE:We're gonna eat chicken for the rest of our lives.
LEADMALE:Oh, Priscilla, I'm so sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Listen.
LEADFEMALE:Be grateful he got it out of his system before the marriage.
LEADFEMALE:It'll give you something to make him feel guilty about.
SUPMALE:Most women go through three, four years of marriage for ammunition like that.
LEADMALE:Hello, Miami Mom's Catering.
LEADMALE:It's Ramone.
LEADFEMALE:Tell him he's scum of the earth.
SUPFEMALE:She says that you are the scum of the earth.
LEADFEMALE:But she said it with a lot of love in her eyes.
OTHERFEMALE:He says he's sorry.
LEADMALE:Do you hear that? Darling, he's sorry.
LEADFEMALE:So I guess that settles everything, okay? We'll see you at your wedding.
LEADMALE:Girls! Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:We're talking about the sacred institution of marriage here.
LEADFEMALE:Are you willing to sacrifice the happiness of these two kids
SUPMALE:for the almighty dollar?
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:I just want to be sure we're in agreement.
OTHERFEMALE:Ramone, I'm gonna put Priscilla on now.
LEADFEMALE:I just talk to him.
LEADMALE:Hello? Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:We're back together.
SUPMALE:Sometimes when you really talk things out like that, you can solve anything.
LEADFEMALE:I can't thank you ladies enough.
OTHERMALE:We're so much in love.
SUPMALE:Ramone can't even wait until tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Oh, isn't that sweet.
LEADMALE:We're eloping to Las Vegas.
LEADMALE:You're what?
LEADFEMALE:He's booking the flight now.
SUPFEMALE:Congratulations, darling.
LEADMALE:Congratulations? Listen, we were going to give you your wedding gift tomorrow, but since we won't see you, why don't you take it home tonight.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, are you crazy? We're gonna lose a fortune on this wedding.
LEADFEMALE:And you let her march out that door with your best piece of crystal.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, police? Yeah, I'd like to report a robbery.
LEADMALE:But that wasn't a scheme, Sophia, that was a legitimate business.
OTHERMALE:And we lost our shirts.
LEADMALE:That's the beauty of this water thing.
SUPMALE:You can't lose.
SUPMALE:It's a rip off, pure and simple.
SUPMALE:That's why the French were first to come up with it.
LEADMALE:Sophia, why are you so obsessed with money? Because I wanna buy a TV for my bedroom.
LEADMALE:Ma, we have a perfectly good TV set in the living room.
OTHERFEMALE:But you never let me watch what I like.
SUPMALE:I wanna make sure I don't miss that final episode of MASH I've been hearing so much about.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, honey, that show hasn't been on in years.
SUPFEMALE:Is Hotel still on? Yes.
SUPMALE:Hotel is still on and MASH isn't? How gullible do you think I am? Do I look like Donna Rice? You know, Ma, I seem to remember another time you were trying to make extra money so you could buy a TV set.
LEADFEMALE:Do you happen to be talking about Brooklyn, April 1954.
LEADMALE:You remember that, but you don't know that MASH is off the air.
SUPMALE:Shut up and stroll with me down memory lane.
LEADFEMALE:I'd taken in some sewing.
SUPFEMALE:It was a couple of weeks before Easter.
LEADFEMALE:I'm home.
LEADFEMALE:Call the New York Times.
LEADMALE:What's for dinner? Pierre is writing today's selections on the blackboard in the kitchen.
OTHERFEMALE:Ow, my tooth!
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, I forgot.
SUPMALE:Stay away from the food on the table, it's wax.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Ma.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, I didn't know you were coming.
LEADMALE:Did you bring the kids?
LEADFEMALE:No, I wanted to talk to you alone.
SUPFEMALE:Sal, Dorothy's here.
LEADFEMALE:Did she bring the kids? Hi, Pop.
LEADMALE:No, the kids are at home.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what the hell is this? I thought dinner was in the oven.
OTHERFEMALE:There's nothing but a tin plate.
LEADFEMALE:Take the foil off the top.
LEADFEMALE:It's something new.
LEADMALE:It's called a TV dinner.
LEADFEMALE:The wax fruit looks better.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, I need to ask you a favor.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna get a part-time job and I was wondering if you could watch the kids two days a week.
SUPMALE:Stan lost his job.
LEADFEMALE:I told you that yutz is a deadbeat.
SUPFEMALE:Stan did not lose his job.
LEADFEMALE:His job, he could afford to lose.
LEADFEMALE:A novelty salesman.
LEADMALE:The novelty would be if he made a sale.
LEADMALE:Don't listen to your mother.
LEADMALE:There's a big market for novelties.
LEADMALE:That plastic dog doo we snuck into Charlie's lunch pail, was a scream.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet his cocker spaniel will catch hell for that tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Lucky me.
OTHERMALE:I'm married to the Noel Coward of Canarsie.
SUPFEMALE:I just want to pick up a couple of extra dollars so we can buy a television set.
SUPMALE:No.
SUPMALE:What? No, I won't watch the kids.
LEADFEMALE:But you love it when the kids come over for a visit.
LEADFEMALE:That's not the point.
LEADMALE:Don't throw away money.
SUPFEMALE:This TV thing is just a fad.
LEADMALE:Hey, did you know this turkey comes with stuffing? Ma, TV is not a fad.
OTHERFEMALE:Otherwise Swanson would have called those radio dinners.
LEADMALE:I told you, no.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know these were mashed potatoes.
LEADFEMALE:They don't have lumps like yours.
LEADFEMALE:You want lumps, Salvadore, I'll give you lumps.
LEADMALE:Ma, I cannot believe you are so old-fashioned in your thinking.
LEADFEMALE:I said no and it's no.
LEADMALE:I'm too busy to have this argument.
SUPMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:I'll just leave the kids with Stan's mother.
LEADFEMALE:Over my dead body.
SUPMALE:That gorilla scares the children.
OTHERFEMALE:Michael didn't sleep for a week after he saw her last time.
SUPMALE:Ma, that is enough.
LEADFEMALE:One way or another, I am going to earn that money for the TV.
OTHERMALE:Sophia, would you just tell her so your husband can enjoy his meal in peace.
SUPMALE:Tell me what?
SUPFEMALE:These peas taste like fresh.
SUPFEMALE:But you can't mix them with the mashed potatoes.
SUPMALE:They should have a tunnel running from the pea compartment to the mashed potato compartment.
SUPMALE:Ma, what is Pop talking about? What should you tell me? All right, all right.
SUPMALE:It's your tenth anniversary, your father and I decided to buy you a TV set as a gift.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you can't afford that.
OTHERMALE:That's why I'm doing alterations.
OTHERMALE:Think I need a wardrobe this size to go to Mulberry Street and squeeze a zucchini?  Oh, Ma.
SUPMALE:What's so funny? I lied.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted the job so we could buy Pop a TV for his birthday.
LEADMALE:Then it's settled.
LEADFEMALE:You buy us one, we'll buy you one.
LEADMALE:It's a deal.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Then your father can watch the Friday night fights with your yutz of a husband, you come here and watch Person to Person with me, and maybe once a week the whole family can come over and watch that new show, Make Room for Daddy.
SUPMALE:Thanks, Ma.
LEADMALE:Where are you going?
LEADMALE:Get some air.
LEADFEMALE:We got air in the house.
LEADMALE:I like beer with my air.
LEADMALE:You wait up for me?
LEADFEMALE:Don't I always?
LEADFEMALE:I love you.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, too.
LEADMALE:I look at him, I see Errol Flynn.
SUPFEMALE:That pizza was delicious.
LEADMALE:The best.
OTHERFEMALE:There's still one piece left, who wants it?
LEADMALE:I do.
OTHERMALE:I do.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I can split it three ways.
LEADFEMALE:What am I supposed to do, lick the box? Ma, you don't like store bought pizza, you prefer homemade.
LEADFEMALE:I also prefer milk straight from a cow.
SUPMALE:I adapt.
LEADMALE:This is awful.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, if you weren't going to eat it, why did you take it? It's the principle.
LEADFEMALE:You're always leaving me out of things.
SUPFEMALE:Now, Sophia, that's not true.
LEADMALE:The hell it isn't.
LEADFEMALE:What about that dance marathon you cut me out of? Oh, now, come on, Ma.
LEADMALE:That was different.
SUPFEMALE:There was money at stake.
LEADFEMALE:We didn't even tell each other about that.
OTHERMALE:I remember I was the first one to arrive, remember? And I was wearing that blue sequined dress  Will you quit complaining, Marty? It's gonna be fun.
OTHERMALE:You said we're going dancing tonight.
LEADMALE:You failed to mention it was a dance marathon.
SUPFEMALE:Well, the first prize is $1000 and I have to have that money.
SUPFEMALE:I'm in desperate need of medical attention.
LEADFEMALE:Is it serious?
LEADFEMALE:Very.
SUPMALE:If I can't afford a new fall wardrobe, I'll never land myself a doctor.
SUPMALE:No offense, Marty.
LEADFEMALE:You know, sometimes I don't think you're serious about me.
LEADMALE:Don't be silly.
SUPFEMALE:I love you as much as I could any dry cleaner.
LEADFEMALE:Run and get us a number.
OTHERMALE:Go on.
LEADMALE:Why, hello there, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:Well, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Russ, hi.
LEADFEMALE:What are you all doing here? Russell and I just entered the dance marathon.
OTHERMALE:Really, so did I.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:It's for charity.
LEADMALE:I thought it would be fun.
SUPFEMALE:Well, have yourself a good time.
SUPFEMALE:Try not to overdo it.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, what is that supposed to mean? Oh, nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Just that these things can be a little strenuous for a woman of your years.
LEADMALE:Who am I, Minnie Eisenhower? I can last just as long as you can.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, please.
SUPMALE:I think I do have a little more endurance than you.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, we are not dancing on our backs.
LEADMALE:You take that back.
SUPFEMALE:I will not.
OTHERFEMALE:You just implied that I'm an old lady.
LEADFEMALE:Well, honey, I didn't mean to imply it.
LEADFEMALE:I meant to say it flat out.
SUPFEMALE:You know what your problem is? You can't stand a little competition.
OTHERMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Which is why you kept this a secret.
LEADMALE:I notice you're here too, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:So you tried to keep it a secret from me.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, girls.
SUPMALE:Et tu, Judas? No, it's me, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:My hair is a little different.
LEADFEMALE:You two found out about this thing too?
OTHERMALE:Mm-hmm.
SUPMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Let give you a little friendly advice.
LEADMALE:You're wasting your time.
SUPFEMALE:'Cause that thousand dollar prize is gonna be mine.
LEADFEMALE:When I was younger, I was known as the dancing fool.
LEADMALE:How old were you when they dropped the "dancing" part?  Yowza, yowza, yowza, ladies and gentlemen.
LEADMALE:And welcome to the thirteenth annual Jefferson Hospital Heart Charity Dance Marathon.
SUPMALE:Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:One word of caution before we begin.
SUPMALE:Contrary to what some folks thought last year, this marathon is not part of the Cardiac Rehabilitation program here at the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:So, if any of you toe tappers have more than 30 percent blockage, we implore you to leave the dance floor at this time.
LEADMALE:All right, now.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's let the dance marathon begin! A one, two, three, four.
LEADMALE:Blanche, you're not gonna believe this.
SUPMALE:I twisted my ankle.
OTHERMALE:I can't dance.
SUPMALE:No, no, no, you have to.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe you'd force me to dance all night in pain.
SUPMALE:I mean, if you win, you said you were gonna take all the money.
SUPFEMALE:What do I get out of this evening?
LEADMALE:Come here.
SUPMALE:Let's samba.
LEADFEMALE: Ladies and gentlemen, our charity dance marathon is now entering its seventh hour.
LEADFEMALE:Let's give our contestants a great big hand.
LEADMALE:Hi, girls, how are you holding up?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, fine, just fine.
SUPFEMALE:Terrific.
LEADMALE:You know, this reminds me of the big dance back in St.
SUPFEMALE:Olaf to kick off Pretzel Week.
LEADFEMALE:My Uncle Gunther, after the great beer nut shortage of '21 Foul! Send a judge over here.
LEADMALE:This woman is trying to put us to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:You're just exhausted and you're trying to blame it on me.
OTHERFEMALE:Exhausted? I'll show you who's exhausted.
LEADFEMALE:Maestro.
OTHERMALE:How about something with a little octane.
SUPMALE:Okay, little lady.
LEADMALE:All right, boys! Take it away! A one, two, a one, two, three, four.
LEADMALE: Out of my way, amateurs.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, mind if I give it a try? Oh, for heaven's sake, go on.
SUPFEMALE:No, Dave, I better do this by myself.
OTHERFEMALE:You might get hurt.
LEADFEMALE:Three, four   It looks like it's going to be a long night.
LEADMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, a nice round of applause for our four remaining couples as we enter lucky hour number 13.
LEADFEMALE: And a special round of applause for spunky Nick Montavesti.
SUPFEMALE:He outran enemy fire at Iwo Jima, but phlebitis is the enemy he couldn't outrun tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:And now, it's time to tango.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Blanche, I can't.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I can't go on.
LEADMALE:No, you have to.
LEADFEMALE:Just a little while longer and I'll have that thousand.
SUPMALE:And you will have a wonderful story to tell your poker club.
SUPFEMALE:No, I'm sorry, Blanche.
SUPMALE:I quit.
LEADMALE:Don't you dare.
SUPFEMALE:No, I quit.
LEADFEMALE:No, I quit.
LEADMALE:Marty! Uh-oh, ladies and gentlemen, it looks like couple 29 is out of the competition.
SUPFEMALE:And that little lady on the dance floor is out too unless she can find a new partner within the next minute.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Excuse me, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Listen.
LEADMALE:Would you consider dumping your partner and dancing with me Listen, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Would you consider it if I  Dorothy, Dorothy! I got a charlie horse.
LEADFEMALE:I can't make it.
LEADMALE:Shake it off, wimp! I can't.
LEADFEMALE:Russell, come back.
LEADFEMALE:Come back here.
OTHERFEMALE:Come back here! Russell! Looks like it's just you and me, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, I'm afraid I have to leave.
LEADFEMALE:Are you in pain?
OTHERFEMALE:I will be if my wife catches me and she just walked in.
OTHERFEMALE:David! David! Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like we have a winner.
LEADMALE:Couple number 29! That's me.
OTHERFEMALE:I won.
SUPFEMALE:I won! I won! I won! Just a minute, it's not over yet.
LEADFEMALE:It looks like we have another couple re-entering the floor.
OTHERMALE:I will never forget the look on your face when Dorothy and I tangoed on to the floor.
OTHERFEMALE:And I will never forget the look on your faces when you were disqualified and I won the thousand dollars.
LEADFEMALE:And it was so sporting of you to share your winnings.
LEADFEMALE:With my $10 I got that can opener I always wanted.
SUPMALE:Don't say no, just hear me out.
SUPMALE:Do you think I'm cute?
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma.
LEADMALE:Just answer.
SUPMALE:Yes, Ma, I think you're cute.
LEADMALE:Would you say cute verging on adorable? Sophia, what's this all about? Just picture my face on this jar filled with my tomato sauce.
LEADFEMALE:We could put Paul Newman out of business.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, if you had your choice of a spaghetti sauce with your picture on it or Paul Newman's picture on it, which would you choose? Back to square one.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Is this 6151 Richmond Street?
LEADMALE:Ma, what's the matter?
SUPMALE:Dorothy, thank God it's you.
LEADFEMALE:I broke my glasses at the mall and I can't see a thing.
LEADMALE:It took it took me six hours to find my way home.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, if you couldn't see, why didn't you call me to come get you? I tried to, but every time I put in a dime and dialed, a condom popped out.
LEADMALE:I got five in my pocket.
LEADMALE:Here, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:A lifetime supply.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, which one of these necklaces looks better with this dress? This gold chain or the pearls? They both look nice, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not sure about the pearls.
LEADFEMALE:Do pearls nestled in the ample cleavage revealed by my low-cut gown somehow might suggest I'm nothing but a cheap, easy, good time? They might.
LEADMALE:That settles it.
LEADFEMALE:Pearls it is.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, you look terrific.
SUPFEMALE:You look like you lost 15 pounds.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, Sophia.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that's your thigh.
OTHERMALE:I thought it was part of the couch.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, try to remember, gravy isn't a beverage.
SUPMALE:Blanche, Ma broke her glasses.
LEADMALE:She can't see a thing.
SUPMALE:Hi, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:What's the matter, honey? Something wrong? Yes no.
SUPMALE:Well, I guess yes and no.
LEADMALE:Honey, what is it? I found out this morning I'm gonna be a mother again.
LEADFEMALE:We've been over this a hundred times.
SUPMALE:You cannot get pregnant using the toilet at the mall.
LEADMALE:I bet it's a boy.
OTHERMALE:You're carrying really high in the front.
SUPMALE:I'm not having a baby.
LEADFEMALE:I'm getting a baby.
LEADFEMALE:I got a telegram that my Uncle Hingeblotter had passed away and left me custody of his baby.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:What are you gonna do? I'm not sure.
LEADMALE:I've always dreamed of the chance to be a mother again, but it's a big responsibility.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it sure is.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not sure I could raise another baby at my age, and I'm far younger than you.
OTHERFEMALE:And prettier.
LEADMALE:Not that prettier has anything to do with it, but I just am.
LEADMALE:You know, Rose, I have a confession to make.
LEADMALE:I have always dreamed of the chance to raise another baby.
SUPMALE:Well, Dorothy, if you're lucky, maybe someday one of your uncles will drop dead.
LEADMALE:What I mean, Rose, is that if you decide to raise this child, I think I'd like to help you.
LEADMALE:Really? Wait a minute, if you both want to raise this child, why, I might even consider it myself.
LEADFEMALE:But you said you didn't want to be a mother again.
OTHERMALE:But I meant by myself.
OTHERMALE:As long as you all are around to change its diapers and clean up when it spits up and pees, I'd love to be a mother again.
LEADFEMALE:Are you girls sure you wanna do this? Look, I know it's gonna be a lot of work, but oh, it'd be worth it to hear a baby's laugh around the house.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, let's do it.
LEADMALE:What do you say, Ma? What choice do I have? If I say no, I'll be back at the home building log cabins out of popsicle sticks.
LEADMALE:Then it's settled.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call the lawyer and tell him to bring the baby.
LEADFEMALE:Did he say if it's a boy or a girl? He didn't say, but it must be one or the other.
LEADMALE:You been watching PBS again, Rose? Dorothy? Dorothy, I'm going to my bedroom.
SUPMALE:I want to lie down for a while.
LEADMALE:Ma? Dorothy, who the hell parked a Buick in my bedroom? Sophia! Rose, what are you doing in the bathroom? Ma, this is the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy, if this is the kitchen, I'm poaching an egg in the toilet.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, look at this old picture I found.
OTHERFEMALE:That's me at 15, standing next to my Uncle Hingeblotter.
LEADFEMALE:Who's the other guy? That's my uncle's half-
LEADMALE:Inkeblotter.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, girls, we have a big problem.
LEADFEMALE:What is it, Blanche?
SUPMALE:Well, we're all women.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Sure we are, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Oh, shut up.
LEADFEMALE:I'm reading the Spock book on baby care, and he says it's important for a child to have a male role model during its formative years.
LEADMALE:What are we gonna do?
LEADFEMALE:We'll wear Yankee caps and scratch our behinds after every beer.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, we don't have anything to worry about.
LEADMALE:If we give that baby love and attention and understanding, it'll turn out fine.
LEADFEMALE:That's beautiful.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, what does Spock know about raising babies? On Vulcan, all the kids are born in pods.
LEADMALE:Rose, I know this is a long shot, but, did you take much acid during the '60s? 
OTHERMALE:Is, uh, Rose Nylund here?
SUPMALE:I'm Rose Nylund.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'm Chester T.
LEADFEMALE:McRainey, legal counsel to your late Uncle Hingeblotter.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we've been waiting for you.
SUPFEMALE:Did you bring the baby?
LEADMALE:I brought him.
LEADMALE:Him, did you hear that, girls? Does he look anything like me? Uh, well judge for yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Baby.
LEADMALE:Come on, Baby.
SUPFEMALE:Well, uh, maybe just a little around the eyes.
LEADMALE:What in hell is going on here? This is Baby.
SUPFEMALE:Five-time blue ribbon winner at the Minnesota State Fair.
LEADFEMALE:This sweet little thing was your uncle's pride and joy.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:That's the cutest baby I've ever seen.
LEADMALE:Ma, it's a pig! You were no great looker when I brought you home from the hospital.
SUPFEMALE:I loved you anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he sure is cute.
SUPFEMALE:Come here, Baby.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I haven't had a pig as a pet since I was a little girl.
OTHERFEMALE:Just forget that.
SUPFEMALE:I want that filthy beast out of my house now.
SUPFEMALE:Fine, your cousin Gunther will be happy to take Baby, as well as the $100,000 that comes along with him.
LEADFEMALE:I beg your pardon? Uncle Hingeblotter was a very rich man.
LEADMALE:And he loved this pig dearly.
LEADMALE:That's why he left you $100,000 to make sure Baby would be well taken care of.
SUPMALE:Well, I'd take care of him for free.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, shut up, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:How long does Rose have to take care of this pig before she gets the money? Well, as long as he lives.
OTHERMALE:Oh, forget it.
SUPMALE:I'd split the money with you girls.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it.
LEADFEMALE:How long does a pig live?
SUPMALE:25 years.
LEADMALE:Forget it.
LEADFEMALE:How old is this pig? Welcome, Baby! Hi, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, how do you make your voice do that? Here, honey, I picked up your new glasses.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank God.
SUPMALE:Now I can see.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:These are no good.
LEADMALE:The wrong prescription?
SUPFEMALE:No, the wrong frames.
LEADFEMALE:I specifically asked for old lady smoky green.
LEADFEMALE:These are black.
LEADFEMALE:I look like Buddy Holly.
OTHERFEMALE:There you are.
SUPFEMALE:You get in the kitchen and eat your slop before I spank that little pink fanny.
LEADMALE:All right, I'm going.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm going.
OTHERMALE:Oh, sorry, that's the way they used to call us for dinner at the home.
SUPMALE:Go on, Baby, go on.
LEADFEMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, I thought we decided that that pig was gonna stay in the pen out back.
SUPMALE:He didn't like it there.
LEADFEMALE:It was too confining.
OTHERMALE:Oh, but Baby's a free spirit.
OTHERFEMALE:A wanderer.
SUPFEMALE:A rebel.
LEADMALE:You know, in a lot of ways he reminds me of Jimmy Dean.
LEADMALE:The actor or the sausage? You know, Dorothy, I was thinking, how wonderful it is to have a pig living here.
OTHERMALE:This morning I was all snugly warm under the covers and I opened my eyes and there was Baby, fast asleep at the foot of the bed, like a sweet angel.
SUPMALE:That is sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, how long do you think it'll be before the pig is dead?
LEADMALE:Did Baby do something wrong?
LEADMALE:No, no.
OTHERMALE:Not unless you count that when he burps, it smells like four burning tires.
SUPFEMALE:Girls, I'm just so mad.
LEADFEMALE:That pig tore up my nightgown last night.
SUPMALE:The people you date are from foreign countries.
LEADMALE:They play by different rules.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm talking about Baby.
OTHERMALE:I never should've let that barnyard beast in my house in the first place.
LEADMALE:He ruins my clothes, smells up the whole house, and he likes to watch me take a shower.
OTHERFEMALE:He's a pig.
LEADMALE:There's no accounting for taste.
SUPMALE:I didn't realize Baby was such an inconvenience.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call my relatives and see if somebody can take him off my hands.
SUPFEMALE:Him, and the $100,000.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, Blanche, the pig is gonna drop any day.
SUPFEMALE:Rose.
LEADMALE:Come back here, honey.
LEADMALE:I guess maybe I was a little bit too hasty.
SUPMALE:Baby isn't really that much trouble.
SUPMALE:Heck, this is an old nightgown, and, well, he is kind of cute.
SUPFEMALE:He's not the first pig to watch you shower, and that's my last pig joke, I swear it.
LEADFEMALE:Then it's all right? He can stay? Well, of course he can, honey.
LEADMALE:That's great.
OTHERMALE:I'll go tell him the good news.
LEADFEMALE:I won't be able to get off work tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Can somebody else give Baby his lunch?
LEADFEMALE:Don't look at me.
SUPFEMALE:I won't do it.
SUPMALE:Why not? What you two are doing is making me sick.
LEADFEMALE:Degrading yourself by living with a filthy animal.
OTHERMALE:And for what? Money.
SUPMALE:It's humiliating.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want any part of it.
LEADFEMALE:What if we cut you in?
OTHERFEMALE:What time does he eat? Girls, girls! Come quick, Baby just collapsed.
LEADMALE:Now I know how Johnny Carson feels.
SUPFEMALE:Baby.
SUPFEMALE:Poor Baby.
LEADMALE:This morning he was so full of life, and now he looks just terrible.
SUPMALE:Rose, honey, don't torture yourself.
OTHERMALE:Now, Baby is very, very old.
LEADFEMALE:Whenever one of God's creatures outlives its normal life expectancy, why, it can go any minute.
OTHERMALE:Would you mind not looking at me when you say that? Does anybody know where the thermometer is? Sure, in the medicine cabinet.
SUPMALE:Why? I wanna take Baby's temperature.
LEADMALE:Although, I'm not sure what the normal temperature is for a pig.
SUPMALE:I know a ham turns out nicely at 325.
OTHERMALE:Ohhhh.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Rose, I don't know what I'm talking about.
OTHERMALE:I'm delirious with grief.
SUPMALE:So, what are you gonna do with your share of the money? Oh, come on, Blanche, the pig isn't dead.
LEADMALE:He's sick.
LEADFEMALE:The money never even crossed my mind.
SUPMALE:Then what were you doing with these EF Hutton brochures? Ma, you took those out of my purse.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, they fell out when I was taking out a 20.
LEADMALE:I'm sure not putting my money into stocks and bonds.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, this is found money.
LEADMALE:This is fun money.
LEADFEMALE:This is hot beaches and sweaty men money.
OTHERFEMALE:Getting naked and rolling around on the ground money.
SUPFEMALE:Even your money has more fun than I do.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, it's great being rich.
LEADMALE:I can't believe we spent so much money that we don't have yet.
LEADFEMALE:Relax.
LEADMALE:When I looked in on Baby this morning, he was a half hour away from Sizzilean.
LEADMALE:Oh! Well, Rose Nylund, shame on you.
LEADMALE:With a gentleman caller in the middle of the afternoon.
LEADMALE:He's not a gentleman caller.
SUPMALE:He's a veterinarian, here to see Baby.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, how is Baby, doc? I read in Newsweek they ran him out of Haiti.
LEADFEMALE:How is Baby? Not very well, I'm afraid.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think he has much time left.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's too bad.
LEADMALE:Tragic.
LEADFEMALE:Terrible.
LEADFEMALE:But there's hope!  What? There's really nothing wrong with Baby, physically.
LEADMALE:He has a mental problem.
LEADMALE:Four grown women decide to live with a pig, and he's the one with the mental problem? Well, I wouldn't exactly call it a mental problem.
LEADFEMALE:When you take an animal out of its natural environment, it's not uncommon for it to have a hard time adjusting to new surroundings.
LEADFEMALE:Are you trying to tell us that that pig is dying of homesickness? In a way, yes.
SUPFEMALE:My recommendation is to get him back to the farm.
SUPFEMALE:Once he's home, he should do a lot better.
SUPMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I guess we have no choice.
SUPFEMALE:I'll call my relatives in Minnesota and make arrangements to send Baby to the farm.
LEADFEMALE:No! I'm just as disappointed as you are! Oh, it's been great having a pig living in the house.
LEADFEMALE:But we can't jeopardize Baby's health, the doctor said so.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, what does he know? He's not a real doctor.
SUPFEMALE:He makes his living sticking thermometers up a cat's behind.
LEADMALE:Well, I don't know, he seemed pretty sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, doctors make mistakes, too.
OTHERMALE:I still think we ought to send Baby home.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, do you realize how far away home is? Baby is sick.
LEADMALE:Why, the plane trip alone could kill him.
LEADFEMALE:Even if he did get home safely, who knows what kind of care he'd get? Nobody loves that pig as much as you do.
LEADFEMALE:As much as we all do.
LEADFEMALE:If you all think it's best, I guess he should stay.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you for caring so much.
OTHERFEMALE:I want you to know that poor, sick, helpless pig in there appreciates what you're doing, too.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna look in on Baby.
LEADMALE:You're the best friends I've ever had in my life.
LEADFEMALE:I feel terrible.
LEADMALE:I feel miserable.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go shopping.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Blanche, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I am so glad you came back.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I have to talk to you.
SUPMALE:I have to talk to you, too.
LEADFEMALE:And it's about the money.
LEADMALE:That's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about.
SUPMALE:I have been so worried.
LEADFEMALE:The way we've been spending this money is wrong.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I could not agree with you more.
LEADMALE:Honey, I've been up half the night worrying about how foolish we've been, spending all that money on silly little things that we don't need.
SUPFEMALE:I am so relieved.
LEADMALE:Oh, I just knew you would agree that combining our money to buy one big thing was the best idea.
LEADFEMALE:I just hope you like it in light blue.
LEADFEMALE:Like what in light blue?
LEADMALE:
OTHERMALE:We'll be right out, Sophia.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, that's a Mercedes.
LEADMALE:I know it.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you just love it? It's ours.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, you don't understand.
OTHERMALE:I wanted to give up the money and send Baby home.
OTHERFEMALE:No, you can't do that.
SUPMALE:We lied to Rose.
SUPMALE:We tricked her into jeopardizing the life of an animal, just to make a fast buck.
LEADFEMALE:We have to tell her the truth.
SUPMALE:I cannot let you do this.
LEADFEMALE:Get out of my way.
LEADMALE:I want that car.
LEADFEMALE:I will give you anything.
SUPMALE:We have to tell Rose the truth.
LEADFEMALE:I'll give you one of my sons.
SUPMALE:I have given this a lot of thought.
LEADMALE:I have had four kids, I have never had a Mercedes.
OTHERMALE:What do you say? Which one do you want? Biff, Doug, Skippy? No, don't take Skippy, he's got asthma.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, this has gone far enough.
LEADMALE:Rose? Honey, I want to talk to you.
SUPFEMALE:Now don't bother Rose.
LEADFEMALE:She's busy.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's okay.
OTHERMALE:I was just thumbing through the old family album.
SUPMALE:Here's a picture of Baby when he was younger.
OTHERFEMALE:Wasn't he an impressive sight? Oh, yes, Rose.
OTHERMALE:But then again, who isn't when he's caught relieving himself and eating dinner at the same time? Well, I think Baby looks a whole lot better today.
LEADFEMALE:A pig isn't supposed to be green, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh! Rose, I have a confession to make.
SUPMALE:When I said I thought Baby shouldn't go back to the farm, I wasn't thinking of him.
LEADFEMALE:I was thinking of myself.
OTHERMALE:I was acting out of greed.
LEADMALE:I wanted the money.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, I am shocked! Oh, so am I! I can't believe you lied to me.
LEADMALE:Well, now don't be too hard on her, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:She may have been doing it for the wrong reason, at least the decision was right because Baby is better off here.
OTHERMALE:Why ya'll looking at me like I'm a murderer? This pig is dying because he's old and sick.
OTHERMALE:I refuse to even entertain the notion that he's slipping away because he's homesick for this godforsaken place.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? He recognizes the picture of Uncle Hingeblotter's farm.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God! He is homesick.
LEADMALE:I'm a murderer.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm nothing but no-good money-grubbing trash.
LEADFEMALE:Baby, forgive me.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, get a hold of yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, I apologize.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, so do I.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose, can you ever forgive us? Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, please.
SUPMALE:We're really sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I might forgive you, but I can't speak for Baby.
LEADFEMALE:Is there something we can do to smooth things over? Well A kiss on the nose might be a nice gesture.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I never can stay mad at you silly gooses.
LEADMALE:What's going on? Oh, Ma, Baby's going home.
LEADFEMALE:May he rest in peace.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, Baby isn't dead.
LEADFEMALE:We've decided to send him back to the farm and give up the money.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Let me get this straight.
LEADMALE:We lived with a filthy pig in our house, bought a bunch of stuff on credit we can't afford, and now we're gonna kiss off 100,000 bucks because the pig is homesick? That's right.
LEADMALE:Sometimes life really bites the big one.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Sophia.
LEADMALE:I see you finally got your new glasses.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, I also got these to beg for spare change on the corner.
LEADFEMALE:That is enough! Now look, we have to stop this moping around.
OTHERMALE:So we don't have the money anymore.
LEADMALE:I mean, we still have a great deal to be thankful for.
LEADMALE:We live in a lovely home, we have our health and each other.
SUPFEMALE:I'll tell you the truth.
SUPMALE:When we had the money, we did crazy, ridiculous things.
LEADMALE:To be honest, I'm glad it's gone.
LEADMALE:Girls, my cousin who took Baby just sent us a letter.
SUPMALE:Please let there be cash in it! I can't stand being poor another day.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:"Dear Rose.
LEADMALE:Just wanted to let you know Baby arrived safely.
LEADMALE:He was really happy to be back on the farm.
SUPFEMALE:His last 36 hours on this good earth were" What? What? Baby died.
SUPFEMALE:Poor Baby.
LEADFEMALE:Poor Baby! Well, I guess he wasn't homesick after all.
LEADMALE:Just old.
LEADFEMALE:And for this I fought my way back from a stroke? I cannot believe this.
SUPMALE:If he had stayed here another lousy day and a half, we'd be rich!  What was that? Oh, no! Oh, they've come to tow away our Mercedes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, now I am really depressed.
LEADFEMALE:I never even got a chance to ride in it.
LEADMALE:Boy, what a great idea.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't it luxurious?
LEADFEMALE:And the engine's so quiet.
SUPFEMALE:There's Alice Feinbaum.
LEADFEMALE:Look at her, green with envy.
OTHERMALE:Eat your heart out, Feinbaum!
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:It's your cab, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Have a wonderful time at the wedding.
SUPFEMALE:Be sure to give Phil and the family my love.
LEADFEMALE:Before I go, I need your opinion on something.
LEADMALE:What should I give Phil's daughter as a wedding gift? Your grandmother's lace tablecloth, or 50 bucks towards getting a neck? Give her the tablecloth.
SUPFEMALE:You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:She's got a husband.
LEADMALE:He doesn't care that she looks like Abe Vigoda, why should I? See you in a couple of weeks, pussycat.
SUPFEMALE:So, what with our busy careers and full social lives, we felt we really needed a full-time housekeeper.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think of our home?
LEADFEMALE:Lovely.
LEADFEMALE:Last place I was had bars in the windows and a big wall with guard dogs.
LEADMALE:Sounds like quite a security system.
SUPFEMALE:The best.
LEADFEMALE:San Quentin.
SUPMALE:Fifteen years I spent in that stinking hole.
SUPMALE:I saw violence, I saw despair, I saw Johnny Cash eight times.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I guess that concludes the interview,
SUPMALE:unless there are any questions.
SUPFEMALE:I have a question.
SUPFEMALE:Does Johnny Cash ever wear plaid? It's not her fault.
SUPFEMALE:She's from Minnesota.
LEADMALE:We'll be in touch.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, girls, we have interviewed dozens of people, we haven't met one likely candidate.
LEADMALE:Maybe our standards are too high.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:May I help you?
OTHERMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Does the mean-looking white woman I just passed live here?
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Then I come to apply for the housekeeping position.
SUPFEMALE:Please, please, come right in.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:I'm Marguerite Brown.
LEADMALE:I'm Dorothy.
LEADMALE:These are my roommates, Blanche, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Please, sit down.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADMALE:Well, why don't you begin by telling us a little about yourself.
SUPMALE:Well, there isn't much to tell.
LEADMALE:I'm hardworking and honest, and I'll work for a reasonable wage.
LEADFEMALE:That's it? All right, I won't go on with this charade any longer.
LEADFEMALE:There is something else.
SUPMALE:I'm black.
LEADMALE:Now, if that's a problem for you, I'm white.
LEADFEMALE:Now, of course, that'll cost you extra.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Marguerite, I could kiss you.
OTHERFEMALE:And I don't go for that freaky stuff.
SUPFEMALE:Neither do Dorothy and I.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? Hello, Norman, darling.
SUPFEMALE:Are we still on for tonight? But you said we But you promised I see.
OTHERMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Bye-Bye.
LEADMALE:I don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:That's the second time Norman has canceled.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe he's not interested.
OTHERFEMALE:Not interested? Don't be silly.
SUPMALE:I am the most attractive and available woman in all of Miami, now that Miss Donna Rice has moved to Hollywood.
LEADFEMALE:I don't mean to pry, but maybe I know a way to get Norman's attention.
SUPFEMALE:If it involves silk sheets and a parochial school outfit, I've already tried it.
LEADMALE:Here, take this.
LEADFEMALE:It's worked for my grandmother, it's worked for my mother.
LEADFEMALE:Dab a little behind your ears and whomever you desire will come to you.
LEADMALE:What is it?
LEADFEMALE:It's a gift.
SUPFEMALE:Keep it.
SUPFEMALE:Marguerite, there's no need to bribe me.
LEADFEMALE:As far as I'm concerned you have the job.
LEADFEMALE:Fine with me.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Can you start tomorrow?
LEADMALE:I'll be here bright early.
SUPFEMALE:We'll see you then.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Be sure and use that just like I told you now.
SUPMALE:Yes, ma'am.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, what an absolutely charming woman.
LEADMALE:I wonder what this is.
SUPFEMALE:I'll bet it's a love potion.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, Rose, come on, honey.
LEADMALE:There's no such thing as a love potion.
OTHERMALE:Sure there is, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:My grandparents got together because of a love potion.
LEADFEMALE:Well, actually it was a foot salve Gramps accidentally swallowed.
LEADFEMALE:You see, Grandma was the nurse who pumped his stomach, but she was new and she attached the nozzle to the wrong place.
OTHERMALE:Next thing you know, they were engaged.
SUPFEMALE:I don't care what's in this.
LEADMALE:It's worth a try.
OTHERMALE:I'll do anything to get Norman's attention.
SUPMALE:If you get Norman's attention, it won't be because of what is in that bottle.
LEADMALE:But if it does, I'll sell my mother for an ounce.
SUPFEMALE:Girls.
LEADMALE:Girls, look what I found under my bed.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, that's the most colorful dust ball I've ever seen.
SUPFEMALE:This is no dust ball, Rose.
SUPMALE:What do you think it is? It's a rock.
LEADMALE:I think it may be some kind of charm.
LEADFEMALE:It is.
LEADMALE:I learned it from my grandmother.
SUPMALE:You see, you put a specially-painted rock beneath a person's bed to bring them a restful sleep.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you saying that you put this under my bed? But I was only trying to be helpful.
LEADMALE:I figured with those terrible bags, you needed the rest.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy always looks like that.
SUPMALE:Besides, it would take a lot more than rest to get rid of those babies.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you all take turns hitting me with a two-by-four? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cause any trouble.
OTHERFEMALE:I think Marguerite's been inhaling a little too much Pine-Sol.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:Weren't you just saying this morning how much better you're sleeping lately? That's right, you said you hadn't slept so well in years.
SUPFEMALE:It has nothing to do with this rock.
LEADMALE:Look, I like Marguerite as much as you do, but she's been here a week and she is not doing a very good job.
LEADMALE:I think she's doing a terrific job.
OTHERMALE:Why, ever since she gave me that potion, Norman's been on me like white on rice.
SUPMALE:I'm talking about White on rice? All right, maybe she's lax on the housework.
OTHERFEMALE:She is more than a little lax.
LEADFEMALE:She's habitually late, she's broken a number of glasses and she threw out People Magazine before I could read it.
LEADFEMALE:Look at all the wonderful things that have happened since Marguerite started working here.
LEADMALE:Blanche is dating Norman, you're sleeping better than you have in years and Sandy Duncan is finally back on TV.
SUPMALE:I think we should have a little talk with her.
LEADMALE:You know Sandy Duncan? Look, Marguerite didn't throw out People.
LEADMALE:Oh, good.
LEADMALE:Morning, Rose.
LEADMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Why are you cleaning the kitchen? This is Marguerite's job.
SUPFEMALE:I know exactly what you're going to say, but I talked to Marguerite on the phone and she has a good excuse for being late.
LEADMALE:Fine, what is it?  She had to go pluck a hair from the chin of a dwarf.
LEADFEMALE:And you fell for that old excuse.
SUPFEMALE:Has either of you girls seen Marguerite?
SUPMALE:She's not here yet.
SUPFEMALE:I wished you'd look at this.
LEADMALE:She melted my buttons with the iron.
OTHERMALE:Now I'll never be able to open my blouse again.
LEADMALE:It's a dark day in the history of mankind.
LEADMALE:Maybe we'd better have another talk with Marguerite.
LEADMALE:Look, I think we've had enough talks.
LEADFEMALE:It's time we did something about this.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Dorothy, you don't think we ought to fire her.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Marguerite is a lovely person.
LEADMALE:She just cannot do the job.
OTHERFEMALE:I hate to admit it, but you're right.
LEADFEMALE:We had a similar situation back in St.
OTHERFEMALE:Olaf, with Mrs.
LEADMALE:Gunderson, our grade school teacher.
SUPMALE:Oh, she was the nicest woman you'd ever want to meet, but as the years went by, she got her facts a little confused.
LEADFEMALE:In biology class she started telling kids While we were studying WWI, she told us mustard gas was something you got from eating too many hot dogs.
LEADMALE:That's why to this day in St.
SUPMALE:Olaf, everyone celebrates the 4th of July with a thin omelet on a bun.
LEADMALE:What do you say after we fire Marguerite, we each chip in and get Rose a CAT scan.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, is there a point to your story? Well, of course there's a point to it.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Gunderson was a really sweet woman but she just couldn't do the job anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Then it's settled.
OTHERMALE:We fire Marguerite.
LEADMALE:Couldn't we wait just a few more days? I think Norman's going to invite me to the premiere of Give 'em Hell, Harry! Starring Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Father Mulcahy from MASH.
OTHERFEMALE:What does that have to do with Marguerite? It was her potion that brought us together.
LEADMALE:Blanche, you still think that Marguerite has some kind of mystical powers?  Oh, well, all right.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I'm just being silly.
LEADMALE:Okay, go ahead and fire her, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Why should I be the one to fire her? You're the meanest.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, that's not true.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy just looks the meanest.
LEADMALE:We hired Marguerite together, we fire her together.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Rose.
LEADMALE:And by the way, you look the dumbest.
LEADMALE:Morning, everyone.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Marguerite, I feel so terrible.
SUPFEMALE:What's the matter with her?
LEADMALE:She's a little upset.
LEADMALE:She just found out Gene Shalit wants his hair to look that way.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry I'm late, but I had to go downtown to get some special herbs.
SUPMALE:I'm throwing together another little aphrodisiac for Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I better get to my work.
SUPFEMALE:Girls, we can't fire her now, she's making me an aphrodisiac! Use vodka and black underwear like everyone else! Can we just get this over before I lose my nerve? Oh! I hate to interrupt your work, but we have to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:I just want you to know that Tootie is my favorite on The Facts of Life.
OTHERFEMALE:You're firing me, aren't you? Marguerite, we think very highly of you as a person, but we're going to have to let you go.
LEADMALE:We we just don't feel you're right for this job.
SUPMALE:But you certainly did when you hired me.
SUPFEMALE:Marguerite, you're fired! Rose, we just did that part, honey.
SUPMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm not very good at this sort of thing.
LEADMALE:Of course, we'll pay you for the rest of the week.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Marguerite, I hope you understand.
LEADFEMALE:I've never been fired from any job.
SUPMALE:We're really awfully sorry.
OTHERMALE:Well, you should be, because I think you're making a very big mistake.
SUPFEMALE:She seemed pretty upset.
LEADMALE:We just fired her.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think she meant, "we're making a big mistake?" She meant that she's unhappy that she lost her job.
LEADFEMALE:Or that she's going to blow up our kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Oh!  Nice hit, Tracy.
LEADFEMALE:Now, why don't you throw one into the Schiller's yard? This has been the worst day of my life.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, what happened to you? First, my alarm didn't go off so I was late to work.
LEADFEMALE:Then I had a flat tire on the way.
SUPMALE:When I finally got there, I smashed my hand in the door.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I feel like crawling under the covers and eating Velveeta right out of the box.
LEADMALE:I hear B.
SUPFEMALE:B.
LEADFEMALE:King does that when he's tired of singing the blues.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, why don't you sit down.
LEADFEMALE:I'll give you some lemonade.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Something weird is going on around here, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be silly.
LEADMALE:You're just having a little bad luck.
LEADFEMALE:Do you really think that's all it is? Of course.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe you're right.
LEADMALE:Need any help?
SUPFEMALE:Get away from me, you jinx.
LEADMALE:I mean I mean, no thank you, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, you'll never guess what happened.
LEADMALE:Norman threw me over for a fat woman.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Rose, but Dorothy ought to be sorry, it's all her fault.
LEADMALE:What? What did I do?
OTHERFEMALE:You made us fire Marguerite.
LEADFEMALE:Now she's put a curse on us.
LEADFEMALE:Come on now.
LEADMALE:You're just upset.
SUPMALE:You're talking nonsense.
LEADFEMALE:It makes perfect sense to me.
LEADMALE:I rest my case.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, you have to admit terrible things have been happening since we fired Marguerite.
SUPMALE:Our plumbing went bad, the refrigerator broke down.
SUPFEMALE:We've all had car trouble.
SUPFEMALE:You haven't slept a wink, and now Blanche's boyfriend's dumped her for a porker.
LEADMALE:Marguerite said we were making a big mistake when we fired her
LEADFEMALE:and she was right.
LEADMALE:I am not listening to this.
OTHERFEMALE:You better listen, 'cause we're in big trouble here.
LEADFEMALE:Now, what are we gonna do? I think we should get Marguerite to take off the curse.
LEADMALE:Maybe we should ask her if she wants her job back.
LEADMALE:That's a great idea.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna call her now.
LEADMALE:Wait, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Nobody is calling anybody.
LEADFEMALE:Now, look, this whole thing has gotten way out of hand.
LEADMALE:First of all there is no such thing as a curse.
LEADFEMALE:No! All right, we've had a little bad luck, but, ladies, that's life.
LEADMALE:I mean, when you look at it, has anything that out of the ordinary really happened? This isn't the Orange Bowl, is it? Gee, I hope Marguerite likes champagne.
SUPMALE:Don't you think we may be going a little overboard with this? Dorothy, remember the crow man.
LEADFEMALE:Do we have any caviar to go with this champagne?  Oh, that must be Oh, girls, I'm scared.
LEADMALE:Now, now, just take a deep breath and relax.
SUPMALE:There's nothing to be scared of.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Okay, Dorothy, get the door.
SUPMALE:Go on.
SUPMALE:Oh, Marguerite, how lovely to see you again.
SUPFEMALE:Please come in.
SUPMALE:Hello, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome back, Marguerite.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you sit down and make yourself comfortable.
LEADMALE:I must say I was a little bit surprised when you called me to give me back my job.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I wanted to explain There's nothing to explain.
LEADMALE:It was all a silly mistake.
SUPMALE:Champagne.
LEADMALE:Uh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Ladies
SUPMALE:These are for you.
LEADMALE:Ladies, this is all very nice, but, please, there's something I must say.
LEADMALE:You see, when you fired me Oh, now, we don't have to go into that.
SUPMALE:Here, a little gift from us to you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, uh  Well Well, isn't that nice? A tiara? Well, you said to get something I'd buy for myself.
LEADMALE:You see, I've always wanted a tiara.
SUPMALE:Ever since I was a little girl back in St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf.
LEADMALE:Every year I'd blow out my birthday candles and wish for one.
SUPMALE:And every year I'd get a freshly-carved pair of wooden shoes.
SUPFEMALE:Except for one year, during the Depression when I just got a block of coal, which I carved into a pair of high-top Keds.
LEADFEMALE:You can do anything you want to her, just don't hurt us.
SUPFEMALE:Here, Marguerite.
SUPMALE:Let me put this on for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my! You look stunning.
LEADMALE:Doesn't she just look stunning? Sophia! What are you doing here? I live here, remember? What is this, the Miss Black America contest? Marguerite, I'd like you to meet my mother.
OTHERFEMALE:This is my mother, Sophia Petrillo.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, this is Marguerite.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm pleased to meet you.
SUPMALE:Won't you join us? Yeah, and pour me some of that champagne.
SUPMALE:I never know if I'm gonna make it to New Year's.
LEADFEMALE:So, what are we celebrating? Did The Supremes get back together? Ma, you know, I really think you should go and lie down.
SUPMALE:You look exhausted.
LEADMALE:Hey, I'm 80.
SUPFEMALE:I look like this in the middle of a dead sleep.
LEADFEMALE:So, what's your claim to fame?
SUPFEMALE:I'm the housekeeper.
LEADMALE:Yeah? You always wear a tiara to clean the toilet? Ma, could I see you in the kitchen? Hey, take it easy! I'm not Gumby! What's going on? Ma, I want you to be especially nice to Marguerite.
LEADFEMALE:Please, Dorothy, I wasn't brought up in a cave.
SUPMALE:Actually, I was brought up in a cave.
LEADMALE:Listen, Ma, I am serious.
LEADFEMALE:You are not to ask her to lift a finger.
OTHERFEMALE:And if there's anything you need, you let me or one of the girls know.
LEADMALE:Let me get this straight.
SUPFEMALE:She's the housekeeper, right?
SUPMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:She's not to lift a finger?
SUPMALE:Right.
OTHERMALE:Anything needs to be done, you take care of it? Right.
SUPFEMALE:Where are you going, Ma? To get a job as a housekeeper.
OTHERMALE:Ma, Ma, be serious now.
LEADMALE:Marguerite is dangerous.
SUPMALE:She put a curse on us.
LEADMALE:And I'm the one that got put in a home? I know it's unbelievable but we fired her, she put a curse on us, so we had to hire her back.
OTHERMALE:Now, if we can just keep her happy, maybe she'll leave us alone.
LEADMALE:You really are afraid of her? Ma, Ma, it's unbelievable but please go along with it, okay? I mean, do it for me.
LEADMALE:If it means that much to you, pussycat, you got it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Now, remember, not a word.
LEADMALE:So, what's all this crap about you putting a curse on my daughter?
SUPFEMALE:Sophia.
LEADMALE:We'll be turned into kumquats.
SUPFEMALE:What is she talking about?
LEADFEMALE:Don't play dumb with me.
LEADMALE:I've been known to cast a curse myself.
LEADMALE:Do you think Shelley Long was really tired of playing in Cheers? Wrong, baby.
SUPMALE:I was tired of her.
SUPMALE:Is that what this is all about? You think I put a curse on you? It's true, you got mad at us for firing you.
SUPMALE:That's why you reversed that love potion you gave me.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, that wasn't love potion.
LEADFEMALE:That was Chanel No.
LEADMALE:5.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not buying that.
SUPMALE:Dorothy uses Chanel No.
SUPFEMALE:5 all the time and she never attracts men.
SUPFEMALE:What about this painted rock that you put under my bed? Oh, thank God you found it! This is very special to me.
LEADFEMALE:It was the first wage I ever earned.
LEADMALE:Ma, they paid you in rocks? Hey, don't knock it.
LEADFEMALE:To this day in some parts of Sardinia, two of these will get you a veal and pepper sandwich.
SUPMALE:Then you lied to me about it's helping me to sleep.
OTHERMALE:Okay, I figured that you'd be angry because I didn't sweep under the bed.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, you're really a good liar.
SUPMALE:I know, that's why I'm studying to be a lawyer.
SUPMALE:See, I'm going to school at night and the only time I have to study is when you all go out in the morning.
LEADMALE:That's why the toilets don't get the attention they probably deserve.
LEADFEMALE:Then everything was just a misunderstanding and Norman really did dump me for a fat woman.
SUPMALE:No kidding? Fatter than you? I hate to burst your bubble but I just wanted a job.
LEADFEMALE:The truth is I don't have any magical powers.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, have I been stupid.
LEADMALE:I haven't felt this dumb since I found out William Conrad wasn't one guy in a jacket and another guy in a pair of pants.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Marguerite, I guess we just let our superstitions get the best of us and I think we owe you an apology.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, I owe you an apology.
OTHERFEMALE:You're right, I'm a lousy housekeeper.
LEADFEMALE:I feel like such a silly goose.
SUPFEMALE:Goodbye, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm really sorry for all the trouble, but thank you for being understanding.
LEADMALE:And thank you for taking care of that Shelley Long.
SUPMALE:I'm tired of that thin, uppity white woman, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that's that.
LEADFEMALE:Anything else you need me to straighten out for you? No, Ma.
SUPMALE:So, tell me, how was the wedding? Beautiful.
LEADMALE:Until the bride lifted her veil.
LEADMALE:I shudder to think what was under that dress.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Hi, Ma.
SUPMALE:What are you making?
LEADMALE:History.
LEADMALE:You finally perfected your non-rolling meatball? Just because you have a chin doesn't mean you're Jay Leno.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, what smells so good in here? Besides me? Lasagna ala Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:I made it for the Daughters of Italy cooking contest.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right.
SUPFEMALE:You twisted my arm.
LEADFEMALE:It's good.
SUPMALE:It's delicious.
LEADFEMALE:It's garbage.
SUPFEMALE:No, what are you talking about? You can't fool me.
LEADMALE:I watched your faces.
LEADFEMALE:Neither one of you got the look.
OTHERMALE:What look? The look that every cook knows and dreams about.
LEADMALE:The look of total instant pleasure.
LEADFEMALE:Your father put that look on my face once.
LEADMALE:That's nice, Ma.
OTHERMALE:Nice? I said once.
LEADMALE:We were married 52 years.
LEADFEMALE:The mail's here.
SUPMALE:Rose, what's wrong? Oh, nothing.
SUPFEMALE:It's just a letter I got.
LEADMALE:It's bad news.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's eerie.
SUPFEMALE:I had the same feeling.
LEADMALE:My Aunt Gretchen in Fort Lauderdale died.
SUPMALE:Oh, Rose.
LEADMALE:Honey, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Were you close to Aunt Gretchen? No, I couldn't stand her.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute, Rose.
LEADMALE:Honey, if you didn't like your aunt, why are you so upset? Because I have to speak at her funeral.
LEADFEMALE:I'm terrified of speaking in front of people.
SUPFEMALE:It's my biggest fear in the world.
OTHERFEMALE:Why can't somebody else speak? Generptionloken.
SUPFEMALE:It's a family tradition.
LEADMALE:It means the oldest niece has to give the eulogy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, not literally.
SUPMALE:Literally, it's a herring poacher you can wear as a sun visor.
SUPMALE:The family got together and they decided that was close enough.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, I take it that no member of your family was ever a returning champion on Jeopardy.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, that's why I have to speak.
LEADMALE:How I've dreaded this day coming.
SUPMALE:I just can't do it! Rose, calm down.
LEADMALE:Honey, now listen.
LEADFEMALE:I know an easy way to get through this.
SUPMALE:The way to relax when you have to speak in front of a group is to imagine what they all look like naked.
LEADMALE:Really?
LEADMALE:Yep.
SUPFEMALE:And if you do it right, you'll probably even start to laugh.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Ma.
OTHERMALE:Hey, what is that smell? The sweet smell of success.
SUPMALE:It's my new entry in the cooking contest.
LEADMALE:Veal parmesan, my luckiest dish.
SUPFEMALE:It saved my marriage once.
LEADMALE:Ma, you gonna tell a story? Please, does Heifetz rosin a bow? This is a tearjerker.
LEADMALE:Picture this.
OTHERMALE:New York City, 1931.
SUPFEMALE:The Depression.
LEADMALE:Your father and I are newlyweds.
SUPMALE:One rainy night, we have our first fight.
SUPMALE:He says he's leaving, I say fine.
LEADFEMALE:He goes out the door, I start to cook.
LEADFEMALE:A few hours later, he comes back.
OTHERFEMALE:He says he couldn't find a cab.
LEADFEMALE:We eat in silence.
SUPFEMALE:Halfway through, I look up.
LEADFEMALE:He's got tears in his eyes.
SUPFEMALE:He tells me, "This meal is like our marriage.
LEADFEMALE:" The veal is like him, tough and stubborn.
LEADMALE:The tomato sauce is like me, hot and spicy.
LEADFEMALE:And the mozzarella is like our 
LEADMALE:It stretches but it never breaks.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, that's lovely, but I don't see what luck had to do with it.
LEADFEMALE:You were conceived that night, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Ma What's lucky is your father never knew or he never would have eaten my veal again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, now you'll just do fine.
SUPMALE:No, I won't.
OTHERFEMALE:I remember the last time I tried to give a speech.
LEADMALE:I was in high school.
OTHERMALE:You wanna hear about it? Would you follow us if we tried to make a run for it? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:It was my high school graduation.
SUPFEMALE:I was valedictorian.
LEADFEMALE:You were valedictorian? Yes.
LEADMALE:I was fourth out of 19 graduating seniors.
SUPMALE:Anyway
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Rose, if you were fourth, how were you chosen valedictorian? The same way every high school chooses the valedictorian.
SUPMALE:We drew straws.
SUPMALE:And you picked the biggest one.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like to brag Anyway, the topic of my speech was "There's a big world out there but you have to change buses in Tyler's Landing to see it.
LEADFEMALE:" Graduation day came and everybody was there.
LEADFEMALE:The mayor was there, his wife, old Johannson, young Johannson, big and little Gustav, the Stringmeyer twins, fat Jerry Will you get to the point, Rose? The point is I choked.
LEADFEMALE:Roped out, froze on the spot.
LEADMALE:Since then, I've never been able to speak in front of a crowd.
LEADMALE:I say next time, we try and outrun her.
OTHERMALE:Listen.
LEADFEMALE:You're not the only one who's gone through this.
LEADMALE:I had a phobia too.
SUPFEMALE:You, Dorothy? You were afraid of something? Big, old, strong, strapping thing like you? Who am I, Joe Frasier? I had a fear of flying, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:And my sister, Gloria, got married in California.
LEADMALE:Course I had to go.
LEADMALE:So I got myself some therapy.
LEADMALE:And it worked.
SUPFEMALE:It's nothing to be ashamed of.
LEADMALE:Everybody is afraid of something.
SUPFEMALE:What are you afraid of, Blanche? Nothing.
SUPMALE:You're a real team player, aren't you, Blanche? I'm not afraid of anything now.
OTHERMALE:But I sure used to be.
LEADFEMALE:Not a phobia, exactly, but something just as bad.
LEADMALE:A recurring dream.
OTHERFEMALE:Night after night, I had this awful dream that I was trapped in an enclosed space full of men.
SUPMALE:Now what could that mean?
LEADFEMALE:Let's give this a second.
OTHERMALE:Now, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:There's more to it.
LEADFEMALE:All the men were bald.
LEADFEMALE:Just me and a bunch of bald men.
LEADMALE:Oh, and I kept hearing the voice of God.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, one day I just finally said to 
SUPFEMALE:"Blanche, you are bigger than this.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to succumb to any dream.
SUPFEMALE:Unless it involves meeting Mel Gibson at an oyster bar.
LEADFEMALE:" And just like that it stopped.
OTHERFEMALE:Mind over matter, you can do the same thing, Rose.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
SUPMALE:Of course you can.
LEADMALE:Think positively.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:Listen, why don't you go to your room now and start working on your speech and in a while you can try it out in front of me and Dorothy, okay?
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Yes, go on.
LEADFEMALE:Go on! Go on.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna tell you something.
SUPMALE:I'm sure glad I am not in her shoes.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'd hate to have to give a eulogy.
OTHERFEMALE:What if it was my eulogy?
OTHERFEMALE:What?
SUPMALE:What if you were giving a eulogy for me? What would you say?
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:I'm serious, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:What would you say? Well, I I guess I'd say that you were a lovely generous person.
LEADMALE:And, you know, one of the best friends I ever had.
LEADMALE:Nothing about my looks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'd say that you were one of the prettiest friends
SUPFEMALE:"One of'?
LEADMALE:"The," Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:The prettiest.
SUPMALE:What would you say about me?
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, come on.
LEADFEMALE:I told you, you can tell me.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Well, I would say I always felt safe having you in the house.
LEADFEMALE:And I would say I always enjoyed talking to you when I'd come home from one of my numerous dates.
LEADFEMALE:And I would say I always looked up to you like an older sister.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Oh, and I forgot one thing.
LEADFEMALE:I would also say you're fat.
OTHERMALE:I'm ready to practice my eulogy.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, if you'll stand by the barbecue.
LEADMALE:That's where Aunt Lib will be.
OTHERFEMALE:Where should I be? Right there.
LEADMALE:That's where Uncle Gunther will be.
LEADMALE:Oh, and it would help if you'd hum.
SUPFEMALE:Is that part of the Viking funeral? No, Uncle Gunther just hums a lot.
LEADMALE:If he has something important to say he spells it out in salt.
OTHERFEMALE:Unless he's quoting a song by the Four Tops.
OTHERMALE:Then he spells it out
OTHERMALE:In pepper.
OTHERMALE:Rose, can we just get on with the speech? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Um Friends, family, Aunt Gretchen was a special person.
LEADFEMALE:She She What's the point? I can't do it.
LEADFEMALE:Of course you can, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:You were doing just fine.
LEADFEMALE:That's because you were here.
OTHERFEMALE:Tomorrow, I'll be out there all alone, staring at my relatives, who'll be ready to hoot and snicker at the first crack in my voice.
LEADFEMALE:They'll think I'm an idiot.
SUPMALE:Please, it's family.
SUPMALE:They know you're an idiot.
LEADMALE:There's only one way I'm gonna get through this.
LEADFEMALE:If you two will come with me to the funeral for support.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, will you do it? Please, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Please, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Please, Blanche.
SUPMALE:I will if Dorothy will.
SUPMALE:Please! If you really think it'll help, Rose, of course we'll do it.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:You are the best friends I've ever had.
LEADMALE:Before I lose the nerve, I better make the plane reservations.
SUPFEMALE:Did she say "plane reservations"? I thought her aunt lived in Fort Lauderdale.
SUPMALE:She did, big mouth.
SUPFEMALE:But she's being buried in the Bahamas where she spent her winters.
LEADFEMALE:Damn.
LEADMALE:I don't have one thing in black that isn't see-through.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, Dorothy, it's good you got over your fear of flying.
OTHERMALE:Oh, right.
LEADFEMALE:The way you used to carry on.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Remember when we went to your Uncle Michael's wedding in Arizona? Before we boarded the plane, you threw yourself on the ground, kicking and screaming.
SUPMALE:It was a little embarrassing.
LEADMALE:I'll say.
SUPFEMALE:You were 48.
LEADMALE:Well, it's all behind me now.
LEADMALE:I tell you, I really feel very comfortable on planes.
LEADFEMALE:Good, you'll probably have to take a dinky little plane to the Bahamas.
SUPFEMALE:They flutter, they shimmy, they wobble You got a lot of guts, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm proud of you.
LEADMALE:Oh, thanks, Ma.
OTHERMALE:Please don't let them take me! What are you reading? I'm checking the weather in the Bahamas.
OTHERFEMALE:It's gonna be in the upper 80's with a nice gentle breeze.
LEADFEMALE:So with that outdoor service, we'll come away with healthy color.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt Gretchen always loved the sun.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe they'll have an open casket.
LEADMALE:Girls, I have some bad news.
LEADFEMALE:I am not gonna be able to go with you.
SUPMALE:Why not?
LEADFEMALE:It's Ma.
SUPMALE:She's sick.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna have to take her to the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:She left for that cooking contest about ten minutes ago.
LEADMALE:She called.
SUPFEMALE:She had a bad cannoli when she got there.
SUPMALE:Right now, she's doubled over with cramps, crying out with pain, and making the most spectacular comeback since Dennis Hopper.
LEADFEMALE:Are you all right, Sophia? Of course I'm all right.
LEADFEMALE:Halfway to the contest I realized I forgot the wine.
OTHERMALE:For your mussels marinara?
SUPFEMALE:No, for me.
SUPMALE:I always drink wine during cooking contests and my sister Sam.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, Sophia's not sick.
SUPFEMALE:She didn't eat a bad cannoli.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoever called and said that was just making the whole thing up.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, Dorothy made the whole thing up.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't want to go with us.
LEADFEMALE:But you promised you'd go.
LEADMALE:I know, that's what I said.
LEADFEMALE:All I can say now is tough! I'm not getting on that plane and you can't make me.
LEADMALE:Well, then I'm not going either.
SUPMALE:Oh, I don't believe my ears.
SUPFEMALE:Girls! The entire purpose of this trip is to conquer our fears.
SUPFEMALE:Why, if we back out now, that'd mean our fears have conquered us.
SUPFEMALE:I will not allow that.
LEADMALE:We're gonna march out that door right now, like the strong confidant women I know we are.
SUPFEMALE:Chins up, chests out, buttocks tight.
LEADMALE:I know "buttocks tight" has nothing to do with it, it just looks good.
LEADFEMALE:Buttocks tight, I said.
OTHERFEMALE:Buttocks tight! Oh, forget it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm so proud of you.
SUPMALE:You're just doing beautifully.
LEADMALE:Nobody would dream you have a fear of flying.
LEADMALE:Unless they happen to glance at the bruises on my forearm.
LEADMALE:You think you could hold on to something else for a while? Oh, of course, honey, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Oh!
SUPMALE:I meant like the arm rest.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Look, girls.
SUPMALE:I found this bolt in the aisle.
SUPMALE:Where do you think it goes? With me, off this plane.
LEADMALE:What was that?
LEADMALE:Them shutting the door.
OTHERFEMALE:They shut the door?  Afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
SUPFEMALE:My name is Candy.
LEADMALE:I'll be your flight hostess.
SUPMALE:Please review the information cards in your seat pockets for the safety information in the unlikely event
SUPMALE:of a mishap during our flight.
OTHERFEMALE:Mishap? What does she mean
LEADFEMALE:What does she mean by mishap?
LEADMALE:Like, bad movies or cold food or running out of ice.
LEADFEMALE:Running out of gas
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:God.
SUPFEMALE:Will you just calm down?
LEADMALE:Drink champagne.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like champagne.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead, it might relax you.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't make me relaxed.
SUPFEMALE:Just makes me wanna burp.
SUPMALE:We burp and the pressure in the cabin will change and we'll fly into a mountain.
LEADFEMALE:That would be a good example of a mishap.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, do me a favor, fasten your seat belt.
LEADMALE:Over your mouth! Why don't we use our time constructively and work on your eulogy.
SUPMALE:What are you planning to say? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I'll probably start out talking about Aunt Gretchen, the person.
LEADFEMALE:She was always a very rigid person.
SUPMALE:Especially now.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, Rose.
SUPMALE:I guess that maybe that champagne did relax me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God, girls, oh, my God, look! What, Blanche, what? Look, all the men on this plane are bald! It's all right, Blanche.
LEADMALE:The captain just turned off the "no bald men" sign.
LEADFEMALE:I am talking about my recurring dream.
SUPMALE:Remember? I'm trapped in an enclosed space full of bald men.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I didn't tell you the rest of it.
SUPMALE:All those bald men and I are on a plane and we fly into the ocean.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on now, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:You're behaving just as crazy as we are.
OTHERMALE:It's just a coincidence.
SUPFEMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, be sure your seat belts are securely fastened in preparation for the take off.
OTHERFEMALE:And if anyone found a big bolt, please return it to me.
SUPMALE:It came off the beverage cart.
OTHERMALE:Yes, that's it.
LEADMALE:The beverage cart.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, it is not a coincidence.
SUPMALE:It is my nightmare and it's coming true.
OTHERMALE:Don't be silly, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Not all of it's coming true.
LEADMALE:You haven't heard the voice of God.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Lord.
LEADMALE:I hope you enjoy your flight.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy
LEADFEMALE:We made a rule.
LEADMALE:No talking, it shakes the plane.
LEADFEMALE:I just had to say one thing.
LEADFEMALE:If Blanche is right, and we are gonna die this afternoon,
LEADMALE:I'm glad we're together.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, that's very comforting.
LEADMALE:Now, shut up.
OTHERFEMALE:I know what you mean, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:We have had some very special times together.
LEADFEMALE:Like the time there was that hurricane and all the power went out for two days and we huddled together to keep warm and sang campfire songs
OTHERFEMALE:and told stories.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:And Rose admitted that Charlie was the only man she ever slept with.
SUPFEMALE:And you admitted Stan was the only man you ever slept with.
OTHERFEMALE:And I admitted my shoe size was really five and a half.
OTHERMALE:I wish we had more time together.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute, what are we doing? The flight has been perfectly smooth.
OTHERFEMALE:There hasn't been a hint of turbulence.
LEADMALE:This is Captain Lord.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like we're running right into the IT of a tropical storm.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a dead woman.
LEADMALE:Unfortunately, that means we're going to turn around and return to Miami.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
LEADFEMALE:Did you hear that, girls? We're saved.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean?
SUPFEMALE:That part wasn't in my dream.
OTHERMALE:The dream's broken.
LEADFEMALE:We're going back to Miami.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna be all right.
SUPFEMALE:Not me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you two faced your fears.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy got on the plane, you faced your dream, I didn't give my speech.
SUPMALE:Give it now.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Go on.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you wrote it, you give it.
SUPMALE:Go on, you can do it.
LEADMALE:Uh everyone? I was supposed to speak at a funeral this afternoon, and now I can't, but I'd still like to give my speech, if no one minds.
LEADFEMALE:I wrote some things down but I'd just rather talk.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, the funeral was for my Aunt Gretchen.
LEADMALE:I didn't know her well.
SUPMALE:The only thing I remembered about her is she used to scare me.
LEADFEMALE:Jumping out of my closet at night, putting false fangs in her mouth, sometimes baying at the moon.
LEADFEMALE:Now her dying scares me.
LEADMALE:But there's a good part to being scared.
SUPFEMALE:You get to know who your friends are.
LEADFEMALE:They're the ones who help you not be scared.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe that's what Aunt Gretchen was trying to do all along.
LEADFEMALE:Help me not be scared.
LEADFEMALE:I think so.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, Aunt Gretchen.
OTHERMALE:Take a seat, lady.
OTHERFEMALE:This isn't the Copacabana.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, that was beautiful.
SUPMALE:It was, it truly was.
LEADMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Lord again.
LEADMALE:If you all look out the left side of our aircraft, it'll tip over.
OTHERMALE:Sorry, just a little small airplane pilot humor.
LEADMALE:Hi, Ma.
LEADMALE:What the hell are you doing home? Ma, let's not get all mushy.
SUPMALE:You chickened out, didn't you? No, we went, or at least we started to.
SUPFEMALE:Halfway there we ran into a tropical storm so we had to turn around and come back.
LEADFEMALE:And the plane was entirely full of bald men.
SUPFEMALE:They were all former Mr.
OTHERMALE:Cleans on their way to a reunion in the Bahamas.
SUPFEMALE:So, tell us about the cooking contest.
LEADMALE:The competition was fierce.
LEADMALE:It came down to my mussels marinara, and Louise Pallito's chicken cacciatore.
LEADMALE:Louise Pallito? Isn't she the one who brags about being Al Capone's piano teacher? True.
SUPFEMALE:103 years old.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, the judges voted.
LEADFEMALE:It was a flat-footed tie.
OTHERMALE:That's when it went into sudden death.
LEADFEMALE:And? I just told you, it was sudden death.
LEADMALE:Louise couldn't take it.
LEADMALE:She keeled over.
OTHERMALE:Kaput! The funeral is on Saturday.
SUPMALE:Sophia, that's terrible.
LEADMALE:You think that's bad? Guess who I volunteered to give the eulogy? 
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Ma.
OTHERMALE:Give me your watch.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want it for? I'm working on a magic act for the talent show at the center.
LEADFEMALE:Abracadabra, one, two, three.
OTHERMALE:Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Relax.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, was your card the ace of spades? Ma, what the hell are you talking about? I think I got chapter seven and nine mixed up.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:This watch is broken.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, Stan gave me that watch when we got married! The marriage never worked, why should the watch?  I've got bigger problems.
LEADMALE:I don't have an act for the talent show.
SUPFEMALE:Talent show? Can I be in it? Blanche, what you're talented at isn't generally done on a stage.
SUPMALE:This isn't downtown Saigon.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, will you do me a favor and forget about the talent show? You're just gonna end up with egg on your face like last year.
LEADFEMALE:What did you do last year, Sophia? What are you, deaf? She just told you.
LEADMALE:I tried to juggle eggs.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Rose.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:What's the matter, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Is something wrong? I'm concerned about nuclear war.
OTHERFEMALE:And just yesterday, her biggest concern was whether Bubbles the chimp was traveling with Michael Jackson against his will.
LEADMALE:Okay, honey, tell us what's wrong.
SUPMALE:What does this picture look like to you? Uh, me sitting on a throne dressed as Cleopatra, watching while two naked men wrestle to see who gets to make love to me.
LEADFEMALE:It's the end of the world.
LEADFEMALE:Only for the loser.
LEADMALE:Okay, Rose, what is this all about? You know that Sunshine Cadet troop I've been helping out with? This was done by one of the girls.
LEADMALE:She calls it "Nuclear Bomb, The Day After.
OTHERFEMALE:" Eight years old and this is on her mind.
LEADMALE:That's unbelievable.
LEADFEMALE:She wasn't the only one.
SUPFEMALE:Three other girls did pictures just like it.
LEADMALE:I don't understand it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey, it's not so uncommon.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, kids hear about nuclear war on TV.
LEADMALE:They read it in the papers.
LEADFEMALE:It's part of their lives.
OTHERFEMALE:They can't help but think about it.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's so sad.
SUPFEMALE:When I was eight years old I was just worried about the usual childhood things.
LEADMALE:How much would the tooth fairy leave me? What would I get from Santa? Would I ever be chosen small curd cottage cheese queen.
LEADFEMALE:I'm only doing this because I have some more coffee left to drink.
SUPFEMALE:Small curd cottage cheese queen? It's our town's biggest honor, right after  Large curd cottage cheese queen.
OTHERFEMALE:The point I'm trying to make is kids should enjoy being kids.
LEADMALE:They should be looking forward to their future, not worrying about the end of the world.
OTHERMALE:Hey, what's with the long faces? We were just talking about the bomb.
LEADFEMALE:Very nice.
OTHERMALE:You haven't even seen my new act.
SUPMALE:Ma, we were not talking about you.
OTHERMALE:Everybody's gonna be talking about me when they see what I cooked up for the talent show.
OTHERMALE:I call my new act "Sophia and Sophia.
SUPMALE:" Get a load of this.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, hi, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Oh, hello, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:How are you feeling today? I've got a little arthritis in my neck.
LEADMALE:I was wondering why my wrist was hurting.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think? Come on, Ma, you could see your lips moving.
LEADMALE:So? Well, a ventriloquist's lips aren't supposed to move, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Is that common knowledge? I'm afraid so, Ma.
LEADMALE:Otherwise it would just be you talking with a sock on your hand.
LEADFEMALE:Tough break, Sophia.
LEADMALE:One minute you're about to entertain the masses, the next you're back on a foot covering a corn pad.
SUPMALE:Now you know how Valerie Harper feels.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's my turn to cook dinner.
SUPMALE:What does everybody want? Nothing for me, thanks.
LEADMALE:I'm not hungry.
LEADFEMALE:Don't let this get to you.
LEADMALE:It's something you can't do anything about.
LEADFEMALE:I've always believed you can fix a problem, no matter how big it is, if you just put your mind to it.
OTHERFEMALE:How are you gonna fix nuclear war, write a letter to President Reagan? That would be pretty stupid, wouldn't it, Blanche? Reagan's only responsible for half the problem.
SUPFEMALE:I'll have to write to Gorbachev, too.
LEADMALE:Rose, honey, you can't be serious.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I'm taking my troop on a camp out in two weeks.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want this nuclear nonsense spoiling our fun.
LEADFEMALE:A well written, thoughtful, intelligent letter to Reagan and Gorbachev might just do the trick.
LEADMALE:Anybody know how many Z's there are in "czar"? Oh I don't know why I bothered to make this.
LEADMALE:Rose could've sat on my hand.
LEADMALE:To this day the ghost of the headless Indian roams the forest crying out, "Where is my head? Where is my head?" If the Indian doesn't have a head, how can he cry out? Maybe he talks out of his behind like Cadet Master Rose.
LEADMALE:Well, the Indian cries out from his heart.
LEADFEMALE:That's the worst kind of cry.
OTHERFEMALE:My father's a surgeon.
LEADFEMALE:That's physiologically impossible.
LEADMALE:How can we be drawn into the story if you're misrepresenting the facts.
LEADMALE:Honey, it's a make-believe, scary camp out story.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, real scary.
OTHERFEMALE:You want scared, kid? You keep it up.
SUPMALE:My mother's a lawyer.
LEADFEMALE:Threaten me again and I'll own your house.
LEADFEMALE:Your father's a doctor, your mother's a lawyer.
OTHERMALE:What are you, one of the Cosby kids?
LEADFEMALE:This is boring.
LEADMALE:I want to watch MTV.
LEADMALE:Yeah! You can't watch television, we're on a camp out.
LEADMALE:No we're not.
LEADMALE:We're in your living room.
SUPFEMALE:The camp out was called off, remember? The rain doesn't have to spoil our fun.
LEADFEMALE:There's nothing we can do outside that we can't do right here.
LEADFEMALE:You promised us we could pee in the woods.
LEADMALE:Get away from that couch.
LEADMALE:I have an idea.
OTHERMALE:Who's in the mood for some real camp out food? I have beans, I have beef jerky, marshmallows We want pizza.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, with artichoke hearts and shitake mushrooms.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Girls, would you be terribly disappointed if I took the troop down the block for some pizza?  No! All right, in an orderly fashion head for the station wagon.
LEADMALE:That's not the way to get your good behavior badges.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, now, you all know you use both fingers for the sunshine salute! I'm so glad those little heathens finally left.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:I am exhausted.
SUPMALE:I don't think I'd have the energy to raise more children.
OTHERFEMALE:Although I am still in my childbearing years.
SUPMALE:Sure, Blanche, you and Emma Jean Cocoa.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God, they're back.
LEADFEMALE:Now I know how the family in Poltergeist felt.
LEADMALE:Does Rose Nylund live here? I'm sorry, you missed her.
SUPFEMALE:She left with her cadet troop.
OTHERFEMALE:Can we help you? I am Alexi Bovanov from the Russian embassy.
SUPFEMALE:Premier Gorbachev read Rose's letter and would like to meet with her.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so sorry It's Coca Cola, no? No need to apologize.
LEADFEMALE:In Moscow I stand in line six hours for half as much.
SUPFEMALE:Would you please make sure Rose receives this note? Wait, you can't be serious.
LEADMALE:Why would the premier of Russia want to see Rose? He was quite moved by her letter.
OTHERFEMALE:He wishes to extend an invitation to her and her family to visit Moscow and discuss nuclear disarmament and world peace.
LEADMALE:We'll be in touch.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Oh, this has to be some kind of joke.
LEADMALE:No, it isn't.
SUPMALE:Look at this.
SUPFEMALE:This is an official document to Rose from the premier of Russia.
OTHERFEMALE:But why would he want to meet the same woman who once said, "If the city of Atlantis is lost, how can Bobby Vinton appear there twice a year?" Rose, the most unbelievable thing has happened.
LEADMALE:Remember that letter you wrote to Gorbachev?
OTHERMALE:He's answered it.
LEADMALE:He wants to see you!
SUPMALE:What did Reagan say? Well, nothing.
LEADFEMALE:He didn't send a letter.
LEADMALE:Well, that is unbelievable.
SUPMALE:I wrote him two days earlier.
SUPMALE:I did the dumbest thing.
SUPMALE:I walked out of this house and completely forgot it's a full moon.
OTHERFEMALE:Under those conditions a Sunshine Cadet Master must wear full headdress.
LEADFEMALE:Here I come, girls!  Kemosabe, I think the world is in heap big trouble.
LEADMALE:  We interrupt this dream for a special news report.
LEADFEMALE:Good evening, I'm Edwin Newman.
LEADFEMALE:The eyes of the entire world were on Moscow today as Rose Nylund continued her mission of peace.
LEADFEMALE:It was 15 days ago that Mrs.
LEADMALE:Nylund wrote the now historic letter that captured the attention of Premier Gorbachev.
OTHERFEMALE:Today she was in Red Square capturing the hearts and minds of the Russian people.
SUPFEMALE:We switch now to Moscow.
SUPMALE: Rose.
SUPMALE:Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:I want you to know Dr.
LEADMALE:Zhivago is my favorite movie of all time.
LEADFEMALE:Now I'd like to introduce my friends.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:This is Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:You have a very beautiful country and I have enjoyed my stay here.
SUPFEMALE:When it comes down to it, your lives aren't really that different than ours.
LEADMALE:Except for your toilet paper.
LEADMALE:No wonder you people always look so grouchy.
SUPMALE:And this is my friend Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, you all.
LEADMALE:I have had such a great time here that I would like to express my appreciation to Premier Gorbachev on this special day.
SUPMALE:Happy birthday to you  Happy birthday to you  Happy birthday Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Number One Communist  Happy birthday to you   Ma, what are you doing here? Thanks a lot for leaving me home.
LEADMALE:Lucky I found this nice German kid who flew me to Red Square.
LEADMALE:Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
OTHERMALE:I know you're dying to hear my act, so I'll get right to it.
LEADFEMALE:I just flew in from Miami and boy, I've got to tell you, your Moscow was one clean town.
LEADMALE:No litter on the streets and all the bugs are in the American Embassy.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Sophia.
LEADMALE:And thank you all.
SUPFEMALE:Remember, give peace a chance.
LEADMALE:The Moscow audience is the best audience in the world.
LEADMALE:The best audience in the world.
OTHERMALE:The best audience in the world.
LEADMALE:The best audience in the world.
SUPFEMALE:The best audience in the
LEADFEMALE:Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you all right, honey? Oh, I'm fine.
OTHERMALE:I just had a dream.
OTHERFEMALE:We were all in Moscow.
LEADFEMALE:It was snowing and we were all wearing fake furs.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess I'm just nervous about that press conference tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:I've never had a press conference before.
LEADFEMALE:The idea of all those reporters coming to the house to ask me questions scares me to death.
LEADMALE:Honey, relax.
SUPFEMALE:Reporters are just people.
LEADFEMALE:They put on their pants one leg at a time.
SUPMALE:Except for that sports writer Steve Maxwell.
OTHERMALE:He likes to jump into both legs all at once, with a little hop step.
OTHERMALE:Rose, honey, there is nothing to be nervous about.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, the press wants to meet you because Gorbachev really respects your views on world peace.
LEADMALE:Boy, when you say it out loud it really sort of lays there.
OTHERMALE:Pay attention.
SUPFEMALE:You're in for a treat.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma, not another act.
SUPFEMALE:No, Dorothy, not just another act, the act.
LEADFEMALE:I've taken a classic and reworked it Sophia-style.
SUPFEMALE: Thanks for the Medicare  For Blue Cross and Blue Shield  For a hip that finally healed  Remember on prescriptions Generic is a steal  We thank you so much  What do you think? Don't hold back.
LEADFEMALE:I can take the criticism.
LEADFEMALE:Depressing.
OTHERMALE:Awful.
LEADFEMALE:Stinky.
LEADFEMALE:Go to hell, all of you! Actually, she took it better than I had expected.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, I've been talking to that good-looking reporter.
LEADMALE:He just got back from Russia.
LEADMALE:He told me some very interesting things.
LEADFEMALE:It snows there in the summertime and they don't have very many attractive women.
LEADFEMALE:Do you realize what that means? When we go to Russia, I will have my pick of any man in the country and you can make a snowman in June.
LEADFEMALE:We can start the press conference now.
SUPMALE:Where is Rose? She left to pick up her cadet troop.
LEADFEMALE:That's adorable.
SUPMALE:She wants to share this moment with friends her own age.
LEADFEMALE:You must very proud of your daughter.
SUPFEMALE:My daughter?
LEADFEMALE:Friends her own age? Why, how old do you think Rose is? Well, based upon her letter, we figure nine or ten.
LEADFEMALE:To be perfectly honest, she's closer to ten.
LEADMALE:Blanche, could I see you in the kitchen for a moment? Was there anything we could get you? Coffee, tea, pair of Levi's? Well that solves the mystery.
LEADFEMALE:They think Rose is a little kid.
SUPMALE:What are we going to do? If she reads that letter to the press she'll humiliate herself.
LEADFEMALE:We can't tell those Russians the truth.
LEADMALE:Why not? Because they will use it as a propaganda ploy to convince the whole world that all Americans are as dumb as Rose.
OTHERMALE:That would rock the very foundation of our government, undermine our great leaders and potentially topple our entire democracy.
LEADMALE:Rocky IV had a profound effect on you, didn't it? Oh, come on, we have to tell them the truth.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, girls.
LEADFEMALE:I hope I'm not late.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Rose, listen, we have something to tell you.
LEADMALE:This is amazing, this is so amazing.
SUPMALE:To think I'm giving a press conference and next week we all go to Moscow.
SUPFEMALE:Can you believe it, Dorothy? No, but then again, I can't believe that God wanted Jerry Falwell to go down that water slide in a cheap suit.
SUPFEMALE:Rose I'm babbling, but it's because I'm so excited.
SUPMALE:Maybe I should open up with a joke.
OTHERMALE:No, my jokes are boring.
OTHERMALE:Maybe I should just tell a story.
LEADMALE:Like the time my Uncle Gustav got drunk and tried to milk a porcupine.
OTHERMALE:Rose, we have to tell you something.
LEADFEMALE:There has been a misunderstanding.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, we just found out today that everybody thinks the letter you sent to Gorbachev was written by a nine-year-old girl.
OTHERMALE:You can't be serious.
LEADMALE:Ah, the troop is back.
SUPMALE:Which one is little Rose? This one! This is little Rose right here.
SUPFEMALE:I will inform the press we are about to begin.
LEADMALE:This is so embarrassing.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll let Linda read your letter.
SUPFEMALE:No one will be wiser.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Is it all right, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Nylund? Gee, I don't know.
SUPMALE:I guess so.
OTHERFEMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:I was afraid I wouldn't get my moon beam badge because you said a Sunshine Cadet never lies.
LEADFEMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, several weeks ago I brought a letter to the attention of our premier.
LEADFEMALE:He was so moved by it's child-like simplicity, he requested to meet with the little girl who wrote it.
LEADFEMALE:I would like to introduce you to that extraordinary nine-year-old girl, Rose Nylund.
LEADMALE:Uh
LEADFEMALE:I'm Rose Nylund.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy.
SUPFEMALE:I'm the one who wrote the letter.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, boy.
LEADFEMALE:I guess there's been some kind of misunderstanding, but a Sunshine Cadet never lies.
OTHERMALE:I have two announcements.
OTHERFEMALE:This press conference is canceled, and I am proud to be the newest citizen of Miami.
LEADMALE:If anyone wants to reach me, my name is Dave.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, that took a lot of courage.
LEADMALE:You all right?
LEADMALE:No! This is the worst day of my life.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, honey.
LEADFEMALE:It's not that bad.
OTHERFEMALE:I made a total fool of myself in front of the press.
LEADMALE:I'm the laughingstock of the entire country.
LEADMALE:What am I going to tell my mother? Your mother's from St.
OTHERMALE:Olaf.
LEADMALE:She'll understand.
LEADMALE:I'm just stupid.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a dimwitted, dumb, simpleminded, grade-A, Minnesota chucklehead.
LEADMALE:But, the important thing is you're our chucklehead, and we wouldn't trade you in for any other chucklehead in the whole wide world.
LEADMALE:Why don't you take it, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to me.
LEADMALE:What you did was great.
SUPFEMALE:It was historic.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, your words managed to move the heart of a major world leader.
LEADMALE:I would like to hear those words, too.
LEADFEMALE:You promised us you would read us that letter.
LEADMALE:I never will.
OTHERMALE:It's too embarrassing.
LEADFEMALE:You said today was the worst day of your life.
LEADFEMALE:What have you got to lose? I'll never read this letter.
OTHERFEMALE:Never.
LEADMALE:All right, then will you let me read it? Oh, fine, kick me while I'm down.
SUPFEMALE:I might as well get used to it.
LEADFEMALE:"Dear Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Gorbachev.
SUPFEMALE:My name is Rose Nylund.
LEADFEMALE:I'm writing to you because I'm worried about nuclear war.
SUPFEMALE:I hear there are enough bombs to blow up the world 100 times and it scares me.
LEADFEMALE:It scares the girls in my cadet troop, too.
LEADMALE:They talk about what they want to be if they grow up, not when they grow up.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I'm asking you to please unplug your bombs.
OTHERMALE:I'll bet my bottom dollar, or in your case, your bottom ruble, that if you called President Reagan, he'd do the same thing.
SUPFEMALE:It's just someone has to be first.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Your friend, Rose Nylund.
LEADMALE:P.
LEADFEMALE:S.
LEADMALE:Don't call the president in the afternoon.
SUPFEMALE:That's when he takes naps.
LEADFEMALE:" Honey, that was really beautiful.
LEADMALE:It's a shame that more people don't think like nine year olds.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? Yes, she is.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, for you.
LEADMALE:Hello? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:It's the president! Yes, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:President.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Goodbye.
OTHERMALE:The president loved my letter! I've got to write this down in my diary right now.
LEADMALE:I just figured out what I'm gonna do for the talent contest.
LEADFEMALE:What, Sophia?
LEADFEMALE:What? My Reagan impression.
OTHERFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Finally finally I'd like to thank our hostesses 
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy,
OTHERMALE:Rose and Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:With people like them to support me, I am proud just to be running for city councilman.
SUPFEMALE:So good night, and remember my 
LEADFEMALE:"Gil Kessler for city councilman.
LEADFEMALE:"
OTHERFEMALE:You call that a slogan?
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse us.
LEADMALE:Easy on the arm, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:You break it, you pay for it.
SUPFEMALE:Ma.
LEADMALE:Ma, you promised you'd stay in your room until the meeting was over.
OTHERFEMALE:Who am I, Alf?
SUPMALE:I was hungry.
LEADMALE:You were spying.
LEADFEMALE:So what? He's a wimp, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:For your information, Gil Kessler is a very bright man, an honest and devoted civic leader.
SUPFEMALE:And probably the biggest wimp I've ever known in my life.
SUPMALE:There's something else I don't like about him.
SUPMALE:What?
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:It's a hunch.
LEADMALE:I can't put my finger on it.
OTHERFEMALE:But if I could, I would have to wash it.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, do me one favor.
OTHERMALE:Stay here until we're finished.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you think your own mother would embarrass you.
LEADMALE:It's not that, Ma.
LEADMALE:It's that, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'd better skedaddle.
LEADFEMALE:You know, my wife is out of town.
LEADMALE:I'm going to be up half the night trying to pick out a tie-sock-hankie combo.
SUPFEMALE:This is just the behind-the-scenes excitement I was hoping to be part of.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
OTHERFEMALE:Good night, Gil.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:I think we ought to be proud.
LEADMALE:We threw one heck of a party.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't you guys just love being involved in politics? Oh, I haven't had this much fun since I worked on the Dewey campaign.
OTHERMALE:Rose, you worked for Thomas Dewey? No, Melville Dewey.
LEADMALE:The founder of the Dewey Decimal System.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Gil Kessler doesn't stand a chance of winning.
LEADFEMALE:Who says?
LEADFEMALE:The Miami Post, the Miami Journal, the Miami tribune, and Miami's own, Sophia Petrillo.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, he's way behind in the polls, but the election is two days away and a lot can happen.
OTHERMALE:I, for one, am gonna do everything in my power
SUPMALE:to get Gil elected.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:You can start by taking this folder he left to his house.
LEADFEMALE:On the other hand, why should I deprive Rose of a chance to be of service.
LEADMALE:All right, but you'll have to wash these dishes.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, those dishes are dirty.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, I'll deliver the folder.
LEADFEMALE:I guess there's no sacrifice too great for a cause you really believe in.
OTHERFEMALE:I just hope that big stupid jerk reimburses me for gas and mileage.
LEADMALE:There goes a great American.
SUPFEMALE:I woke you up, didn't I? And I better have a good reason.
LEADMALE:Well, I do.
LEADMALE:I got a great idea for Gil's campaign.
LEADFEMALE:I'm making bird feeders with his name on them to send around.
LEADMALE:And you think that's a dumb idea.
LEADFEMALE:You feel like taking this bird feeder away from me.
SUPFEMALE:And smashing it with this hammer.
SUPFEMALE:Like this.
SUPMALE:Holy smoke.
SUPMALE:Holy Toledo.
LEADMALE:Holy mackerel.
OTHERMALE:What, Ma?
LEADFEMALE:Nothing.
LEADMALE:What is it, Sophia? What, Rose? What? They caught Gil Kessler having an affair.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you're kidding.
OTHERFEMALE:With whom? They don't know her name.
LEADMALE:But look.
OTHERMALE:They hid in the bushes and took this picture of her from behind going into his house.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe it Wait a minute, that looks like Blanche's red dress.
SUPFEMALE:And those look like Blanche's red shoes.
LEADFEMALE:And aren't they her diamond earrings and gold bracelet? That little floozy stole Blanche's clothes.
SUPMALE:It's like having Agatha Christie right here in our kitchen.
LEADMALE:Rose, Blanche is that little floozy.
OTHERMALE:You You mean
SUPFEMALE:She's at the 50.
LEADMALE:you think she
LEADFEMALE:The 40.
LEADFEMALE:The 30.
SUPMALE:Blanche, it's you! You're getting so good at that, Rose.
LEADMALE:Now who's that over there? No, I mean right here.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
OTHERFEMALE:My backside is spread all across the front page.
SUPMALE:How could they do that? They probably used a wide-angle lens.
OTHERFEMALE:If I'd known I was being photographed, I would've turned around and smiled.
LEADMALE:Listen, Blanche, ruining a man's career for a one night stand is hardly something to make light of.
LEADMALE:Oh, now, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You girls don't believe this.
LEADMALE:I'm not denying that's me in the photograph, but I am denying that anything happened.
LEADFEMALE:I just dropped off his folder.
LEADFEMALE:Then why does it say here that you were in his house for two hours? We were just talking.
SUPMALE:Then why does it say, "The explosion was so great, it shattered windows in the building next door.
LEADMALE:" Rose, that's an article about an earthquake in Guatemala.
SUPFEMALE:Girls, I dropped off the folder, talked for two hours, helped him pick out his tie-sock-hankie combo, and came home.
SUPFEMALE:Now, nothing else happened.
LEADMALE:I swear.
OTHERMALE:Okay?
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Now, how are we gonna help him get out of this mess? I ought to call the newspaper.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:I think you should let Gil handle it himself.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, the paper says he's having a press conference this afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think you should do anything until then.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Fine, I'll wait.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this picture of Kessler, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:There's a secret behind those eyes.
SUPMALE:Trust my hunch on this one.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Remember your hunch about your nephew, Angelo?
LEADMALE:You said one day he'd be Pope.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, you gotta pay attention.
SUPMALE:I said one day, he'd sell dope.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think he went to Attica for, the volleyball program? Bruno Bonofiglio.
OTHERMALE:Ma! I was asleep! So was I.
LEADFEMALE:That's when it came to me.
LEADMALE:Picture this.
SUPMALE:Sicily, 1922.
OTHERMALE:The village is in a terrible wine crisis.
LEADMALE:It's the peak of the wine season.
SUPFEMALE:All our grape stompers are ravaged by an outbreak of athlete's foot.
LEADFEMALE:Soon the Chianti has a green hue and tastes like Desenex.
LEADFEMALE:They call in Sicily's foremost podiatrist, Bruno Bonofiglio.
LEADFEMALE:He's the one who prescribed arch supports for Mussolini.
OTHERFEMALE:Must have really helped his lower back when they hung him by his heels.
OTHERFEMALE:Forget him.
LEADMALE:I'm talking about Bruno Bonofiglio.
SUPFEMALE:I take one look at him, and I have a hunch he's trouble.
SUPFEMALE:But nobody believes me.
LEADFEMALE:So, what happens? He cures everybody and wine sales skyrocket.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Unless I'm missing something, your hunch was wrong.
LEADFEMALE:My hunches are never wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Now, everyone is living high on the hog and eating rich foods.
SUPFEMALE:The next thing you know, there's a gout epidemic.
LEADMALE:Nobody can stomp grapes.
LEADFEMALE:And Bruno makes a killing selling orthopedic sandals.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell me.
LEADFEMALE:He went to America, and changed his name to Dr.
OTHERFEMALE:Scholl.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, he developed a foot fetish and suffocated when he shoved his head in a lady's rubber boot.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, don't ever wake me up again.
LEADMALE:Quick.
LEADMALE:Turn on the television.
SUPFEMALE:Gil's press conference is about to start.
SUPMALE:Gosh, I'm nervous.
SUPFEMALE:I hope they're not too hard on him.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't be too sure.
SUPFEMALE:Look at all those reporters.
LEADMALE:Yeah, there's Charlie Thompson.
LEADFEMALE:And Fred Leone, and Mike Devlin.
LEADFEMALE:Does he plan to withdraw from the race? I had lunch at the press club once.
OTHERFEMALE:Only once? Gosh, it took me two years to learn everybody's name on Eight is Enough.
LEADMALE:Hush, hush, he's about to start.
SUPMALE:Well, we're about to find out.
LEADMALE:Here comes the candidate and his campaign manager now.
LEADMALE:Good afternoon.
SUPFEMALE:I'm here to respond to the media speculation that I am having an affair with an unidentified woman.
LEADMALE:I have been the subject of many scurrilous, slanderous and downright malicious rumors in my career.
LEADFEMALE:But this rumor is the worst kind of rumor.
LEADFEMALE:This is a true rumor.
OTHERMALE:It actually happened Just like you said.
LEADFEMALE:Well, not with me, it didn't.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Kessler, who was the woman? I can't reveal her identity under any circumstances.
SUPMALE:Independent sources identified her as Blanche Devereaux.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please.
SUPMALE:What sources? Sorry, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:He just lied.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, he Rose? Well, don't you girls believe me? Sophia? I believe you, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Absolutely.
SUPMALE:Hello? I need a number for People magazine.
LEADFEMALE:The department that buys stories about politicians who sleep with sleazy broads.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, it's not about you.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, Rose? Talk to me.
SUPFEMALE:You girls have got to believe me.
LEADMALE:We believed you once, Blanche.
LEADMALE:We're not falling for it again.
OTHERFEMALE:Falling for what? I told you the truth.
LEADFEMALE:Come off it.
LEADMALE:You really expect us to believe that Gil was lying on television in front of a million people? People lie on television, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:They do it on 60 Minutes all the time.
LEADMALE:He's a married man running for election.
LEADMALE:Why would he say he had an affair if he hadn't? I'm sure I don't know.
SUPMALE:And I also don't know why you just assume I'm guilty.
LEADMALE:Can you give me one good reason why I would lie to you? You're embarrassed because you seduced him.
LEADFEMALE:You're scared and guilty because you've ruined his campaign.
LEADFEMALE:Three good reasons.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, shut up, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, shut up, Rose.
LEADMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, this is Blanche Devereaux.
LEADMALE:Yes, that Blanche Devereaux.
SUPMALE:And no, I did not.
SUPMALE:Absolutely not.
LEADMALE:I will tell it to a judge, I will yell it from the highest mountain, I will swear to it on a stack of Bibles.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, did that sound like a liar? No.
SUPFEMALE:It sounded like Jim and Tammy Faye on Nightline.
SUPMALE:Hello? Yes, this is Blanche, and how did you get this number? Better yet, why am I even talking to you? I don't like you.
SUPMALE:Matter of fact, I hate you.
SUPMALE:You can just tear up my number and go climb back under your slimy rock with all the rest of your slimy friends.
LEADFEMALE:And don't you ever call here again.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, call Stan.
LEADMALE:Blanche, why don't you admit what you did.
SUPFEMALE:You made a mistake.
LEADMALE:You live your life a certain way and now you're paying for it.
OTHERFEMALE:You are assuming that I'm guilty because of my past.
LEADMALE:Well, that is not fair.
OTHERMALE:Listen, girls, I'm in trouble here.
LEADMALE:Now, this isn't funny anymore.
OTHERMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:This is not funny.
SUPMALE:It is sad.
LEADMALE:You couldn't come to us and tell us the truth.
LEADMALE:And you still can't.
SUPMALE:Don't do this to me.
SUPMALE:You're my two best friends.
SUPMALE:How do we know you're telling the truth about that? Well, I guess you don't.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, Miss.
SUPFEMALE:You can't go in there.
SUPMALE:Oh, the hell I can't.
SUPFEMALE:I ought to kick your butt to Tallahassee.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:You're sor Do you have reporters badgering you? Do you have roommates calling you a liar? You are the damn liar.
OTHERMALE:I wouldn't sleep with you if you were the last man in Creation.
SUPFEMALE:Now, why did you lie?
LEADFEMALE:Well, the reason is
LEADFEMALE:Why? I was trying
SUPFEMALE:Why? Nobody ever listens to me.
SUPFEMALE:Quit whining, you wimp, and tell me why you lied.
LEADMALE:That is the reason.
SUPMALE:Nobody ever listens to me.
LEADMALE:They never have.
LEADMALE:I'm a wimp, just like you said.
LEADFEMALE:At least I was until today.
LEADMALE:When the newspaper printed that story about my having an affair, people stopped thinking I was a wimp and started listening.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't tell them it was a mistake.
LEADMALE:Are you trying to tell me that people like you better now because they think you went to bed with a gorgeous woman? Here, see for yourself.
LEADFEMALE:This is today's poll.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I never expected that they would figure out it was you in that picture.
LEADMALE:I felt terrible when they did.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how do you think I feel? People think I slept with you.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche all my life, people have looked right past me.
LEADMALE:You know, when I was growing up, the first day back at school every year, half the other kids always thought I was new in town.
OTHERMALE:I had to bring in a yearbook to prove that they were wrong.
LEADMALE:But all the same, I always felt that deep inside me was a great man trying to get out.
LEADMALE:So I went into politics.
SUPFEMALE:And people kept looking right past that great man.
LEADMALE:Until today.
LEADMALE:Blanche, as crazy as it sounds, I've got a real chance to win.
SUPMALE:Because you lied.
LEADFEMALE:Is that such a high price? Oh, Gil, I don't know much about politics, but I do know a thing or two about men.
LEADFEMALE:And I know what kind of man you are.
SUPFEMALE:You're an honest man.
LEADMALE:That's why we all believed in you.
SUPFEMALE:Now you started lying and you're just like other politicians.
SUPMALE:Dishonest.
OTHERFEMALE:If you even win this election, it won't mean a hill of beans.
LEADMALE:'Cause it won't be you winning.
SUPMALE:You'll never be a great man, without being an honest man.
LEADFEMALE:You think about that.
LEADMALE:This is exciting.
LEADFEMALE:Just think, in less than 24 hours, Gil Kessler could be city councilman.
LEADMALE:I'd love to get excited, Rose, but no matter what happens, I'm gonna get stuck cleaning out that peeing-angel punch bowl.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, I've been chatting with your boy, Kessler.
LEADFEMALE:Give me another hour, I'll have his secret figured out.
LEADMALE:What secret? You got cheese in your ears? I said give me another hour.
LEADFEMALE:Get away from me, you bloodhounds.
LEADFEMALE:I have nothing to say to you.
SUPMALE:Except 
LEADMALE:From now on, when my name appears in print, it better read Blanche Devereaux, comma, 39.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she has a lot of nerve showing up here tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Let's try to be polite, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Hi, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I said hello.
SUPFEMALE:I don't normally speak to people who call me a liar.
SUPMALE:Now look, Blanche, we're in public now.
OTHERFEMALE:There's no reason to be hostile.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, there is.
LEADMALE:I don't like you.
LEADFEMALE:And horizontal stripes make you look like Roger Ebert.
SUPFEMALE:Do you really want to put this on a level of name calling?
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:So do I.
LEADFEMALE:Traitor.
LEADFEMALE:Back stabber.
SUPMALE:Tramp.
LEADFEMALE:Home wrecker.
SUPMALE:Indian giver.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, I just got caught up in the moment.
OTHERMALE:Ladies and gentlemen.
LEADFEMALE:If I could have your attention, I have a few words I'd like to say.
SUPFEMALE:First off, I want to thank all of you.
SUPMALE:This has been a great campaign.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow at this time, I could actually be your councilman.
LEADMALE:But I don't want to be your city councilman unless I can win this job honestly, and there is something that I have not been honest about.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche Devereaux and I never had an affair.
SUPMALE:I only said that to improve my image.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha, ha, ha.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche is too good a person to be used that way.
LEADMALE:In fact, she made me realize how important honesty is.
LEADMALE:That's why I'm going to be honest about something else.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not who you think I am.
OTHERMALE:In 1968, I had an operation.
LEADMALE:Until that time, I lived life as part-time stenographer and mild-mannered housewife, Anna-Maria Bonnaduci.
OTHERFEMALE:What? I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:What do you say about my hunches now, Dorothy? Five more minutes, I would have had it.
LEADMALE:Ma, how could you know? No one knew.
LEADMALE:Please, look at his nose, of course he's Italian.
LEADFEMALE:I'm still confused about the operation Gil Kessler had.
SUPMALE:Is the man asleep during it? I think so, Rose.
LEADMALE:And what about the parts they put on? Do they test them first? Of course, Rose, you know, like windshield wipers.
LEADMALE:So they work.
LEADFEMALE:I assume so, yes.
LEADMALE:What are they made of? Silly putty, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I just want to forget the whole incident.
SUPFEMALE:It's been a terrible night and I am very upset.
LEADMALE:Because Gil dropped out of the election and Blanche hates us.
LEADMALE:I'm upset because they haven't re-run the Facts of Life Goes to Australia.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't be surprised if Blanche never speaks to us again.
LEADFEMALE:She'd certainly have every reason not to.
SUPMALE:We did a terrible thing, not believing her.
LEADMALE:We might as well get used to the fact that she's gonna be mad at us for a long, long time.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, girls.
LEADFEMALE:How ya'll doing? Why, Blanche, aren't you mad? Not anymore.
LEADMALE:But we did a terrible thing.
SUPFEMALE:You should stay mad at us for a long, long time.
OTHERFEMALE:You should make us grovel, eat dirt, beg for forgiveness, give us the silent treatment.
LEADMALE:Rose, if you give us the silent treatment, I will eat dirt.
LEADMALE:I couldn't stay mad at you girls, you know? I did some thinking and I realized I was as much to blame for all this as you all were.
LEADMALE:How?
LEADMALE:By talking so much.
SUPMALE:As you know, I've always talked a lot about my men.
SUPFEMALE:And sometimes I've stretched the truth just a little.
LEADMALE:It's an old Southern tradition, storytelling.
SUPMALE:Just because you didn't have a good time there's no reason to bore your friends with a dull story.
SUPFEMALE:So you embellish it, you add a little shading, a little color, a little hot tub.
OTHERMALE:I guess it finally caught up with me.
LEADFEMALE:But I do think I've learned my lesson.
OTHERFEMALE:Can we have a hug and forget this ever happened? You bet we can.
SUPFEMALE:Come here, you two.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm glad we're friends again.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, me too.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, Blanche, now that we have you telling the truth, um Would you tell us the truth about, um, Bob Fredericks.
LEADMALE:True, absolutely true.
LEADMALE:How about Howard Asher? True.
LEADFEMALE:Eric Murdock.
LEADFEMALE:True, true.
LEADFEMALE:He had a twin brother.
LEADFEMALE:Would I lie to my two best friends? 
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I want a driver's license.
LEADFEMALE:What for? I'm doing a lot of stuntwork in the new Burt Reynolds movie.
SUPFEMALE:Why do you think? Ma, you haven't driven in years.
LEADMALE:Why is this coming up now? This morning at the center, Gladys Weinstock and I had a fight.
LEADFEMALE:We both claim we're natural redheads, but of course at our age we can't prove it anymore.
LEADFEMALE:So? So, when I pulled out my license to show her, everyone saw it was expired.
OTHERFEMALE:It made me feel old, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:I want to learn again.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, you're 81 years old.
SUPMALE:Your eyesight is weaker.
LEADFEMALE:Your reflexes are slower.
LEADMALE:And who are you, Magic Johnson? Dorothy, please.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, all right, Ma, we'll give it a try.
SUPMALE:But, Ma, if anything goes wrong we stop.
SUPFEMALE:Relax.
LEADFEMALE:There are some things you never forget.
LEADMALE:Driving a car is like making love.
LEADMALE:In both cases, a mirror makes objects appear larger than they really are.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dorothy, I'm just so angry! Floyd McCallan just called me one hour before he's supposed to pick me up in his brand new two-tone Mercedes.
OTHERFEMALE:He's canceled our date for tonight!
LEADMALE:He probably had a good reason.
OTHERFEMALE:He said he had to go visit his sick mother in the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:Did you ever hear such a weak excuse?  And his mother isn't in the hospital.
LEADMALE:Of course she is, but he can visit her anytime.
SUPFEMALE:He can only see me tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Is my cousin Sven here yet?
OTHERMALE:No, Rose.
LEADMALE:Oh, good.
SUPMALE:I got caught up at work and I barely had time to pick up a cake.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted to make Sven feel welcome.
SUPMALE:Rose, that cake is from the "Get it While it's Hot" erotic bake shop.
SUPMALE:Whoa!  Why, Rose Nylund! Why, that cake is in the shape Blanche, we know what it is.
SUPMALE:I thought it was in the shape of Florida.
LEADMALE:That reminds me, I've got to give Charlie Milburne a call.
LEADMALE:If this cake reminds you of Charlie Milburne, we could both give him a call.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, how long is your cousin Sven going to, uh,  be, uh, staying here with us? Oh, just a couple of days.
LEADMALE:On Saturday he's flying back to St.
LEADMALE:Olaf to meet his fiancée.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, she went all alone? No, he's never met her.
LEADMALE:It's an arranged marriage.
LEADFEMALE:See, little Sven's father, we call him Big Sven, left the old country two years ago and settled in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf.
SUPMALE:Then he sent for the rest of his family.
LEADFEMALE:First he brought his father over.
LEADMALE:We call him "Big Sven," too.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, doesn't that get confusing, having two Big Svens? There aren't, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:There's Big Sven and Big Sven II.
OTHERFEMALE:Like Jaws and Jaws II.
SUPMALE:Rose, are any of your relatives named Psycho and Psycho II? Anyway, Big Sven picked out a bride for little Sven and now he's flying him over.
OTHERMALE:I don't know, it seems so unfair to me, an arranged marriage.
LEADMALE:I don't know, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:It can be fun.
LEADMALE:George and I had that kind of marriage.
SUPMALE:George would dress up as a ghost and chase me around the house with one of those little fly swatters.
LEADMALE:Then when he caught me, he'd Blanche, I'm talking about arranged marriages not deranged marriages.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:Oh, that must be Sven!
LEADFEMALE:Cousin Rose?
LEADFEMALE:Cousin Sven! Oh! Oh, let me look at you.
LEADMALE:Boy have you grown! We've never met.
SUPMALE:But admit it, you have grown! Uh, Rose, could you introduce Blanche and me.
OTHERMALE:Of course.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, this is Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, this is Dorothy.
LEADMALE:We have jokes like that around here all the time.
LEADMALE:It's like living in a house full of Howie Mandels.
LEADMALE:Sven, I'm Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm Blanche.
SUPMALE:Welcome.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Rose tells us you're getting married.
SUPMALE:Yes, and I hope I'm good at it.
SUPFEMALE:I don't have that much experience with women.
LEADMALE:A big, strong, handsome thing like you? Get out of here.
SUPMALE:Well, it was nice meeting all of you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that was an expression! Sven! I never thought I'd say this but I think Rose got the brains in that family.
LEADMALE:Meet me out front, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna pull the car around.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, hold it.
LEADMALE:Hold it.
LEADMALE:I told you last night, we don't do any driving until we've gone over all the rules in the driving manual.
LEADFEMALE:What's to go over? "How much distance should there be between you and a fire hydrant?" What am I, a poodle?
LEADMALE:Morning, girls.
LEADMALE:Morning.
LEADMALE:Hey, what got you two up and out so early? I wanted to show Sven as many of the sights as possible today.
SUPFEMALE:Did he get a picture with that Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Whipple cutout at the A&P? We stopped to pick up breakfast before we started off on our big day.
OTHERFEMALE:Will you ladies join us?
SUPFEMALE:What are you making?
LEADMALE:Flendahueven.
LEADFEMALE:What's that?
LEADMALE:Oatmeal.
LEADMALE:It's usually served with a cracker made from yak intestine.
LEADFEMALE:Of course! Yak snacks.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, girls.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Swin.
LEADMALE:It's Sven, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:Whatever.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, could I borrow your white wind breaker? Floyd is taking me sailing today on his yacht.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Blanche I guess he felt so guilty about canceling last night he wanted to do something extra special.
LEADMALE:Uh, Blanche
LEADMALE:I can just hardly wait.
LEADMALE:Blanche
LEADMALE:If you're about to tell me Floyd canceled, I don't want to hear it.
LEADMALE:He called.
LEADMALE:Oh! This is the last straw! This is it! I don't care if Floyd does own the most successful pet neutering business in greater Miami.
LEADFEMALE:As of this minute, I am never speaking to that lowdown scuzzball ever again!
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:He changed his mind! Hello.
LEADMALE:Yes, this is Rose.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:Well, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:Sven, I have some bad news.
SUPMALE:Is it bad news?
LEADFEMALE:Yes, it's bad.
LEADFEMALE:Were you two the cousins who play the banjo in Deliverance?
LEADFEMALE:Rose, what's wrong?
SUPMALE:That was the center.
LEADFEMALE:I have to work today.
LEADMALE:Now who's gonna show Sven the sights? The only sights we're seeing is the empty lot behind the mall.
SUPFEMALE:I already showed him that.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:I have an idea.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, you're free.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you take Sven around? I don't think I feel like sightseeing.
LEADFEMALE:It might do you good.
LEADFEMALE:I know it'll do you good.
LEADFEMALE:And it's certainly a lot healthier than sitting here in the house stewing all day.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe you're right.
OTHERMALE:An active day out on the town with a handsome young man might take my mind completely off old
OTHERFEMALE:what's-his-name.
LEADFEMALE:Floyd.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, come on, Swin.
LEADFEMALE:It's Sven.
LEADFEMALE:He's mine now, I can call him what I want to.
LEADMALE:If you don't mind, Blanche, I'd like to pay for lunch.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't be silly, Swin.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean it.
OTHERMALE:You gave me a great tour of the city today.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think we have that many women shoe stores in my whole country.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my Lord! Look who just walked in.
LEADMALE:Who?
LEADFEMALE:Floyd.
LEADFEMALE:Look at that young thing with him.
LEADFEMALE:Why, she's half his age!
LEADFEMALE:She's half your age.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up and hold my hand.
SUPFEMALE:What? Hold my hand.
LEADMALE:Now look deep into my eyes.
SUPFEMALE:Look like you want to kiss me.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, move your lips around.
LEADMALE:Go like this.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, I don't
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, get ready to kiss me.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche
SUPMALE:Get set.
LEADMALE:Blanche
LEADMALE:Go! Blanche, is that you? Well, Floyd McCallan! Oh, shame on you, sneaking up on us like that.
OTHERMALE:And in front of this young child, too.
SUPMALE:Blanche, this is Linda.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, Linda.
SUPFEMALE:Is your daddy taking you out to lunch?
SUPMALE:Linda's just a friend.
LEADMALE:Oops.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Floyd, I'm just so embarrassed at you, catching me and Swin like this.
LEADMALE:Of course, you should've seen us a few minutes ago.
SUPFEMALE:We were feeding each other.
LEADMALE:Blanche, look, about those dates I canceled Honey, forget all about that, I know I have.
SUPMALE:Blanche, can I call you later?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure, if you want to.
SUPMALE:I'm not sure I'll be at home.
LEADFEMALE:I just suddenly have this craving for dessert.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Swin, we're going to your place.
SUPMALE:Okay, we can try, but I've never sailed around the Cape of Good Hope this time of year.
LEADFEMALE:I am never getting into a car with you again.
LEADMALE:Ever.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you're being such a wimp.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, you went through the stop sign, you hit a mailbox, you almost ran over Mrs.
LEADMALE:Burlfine! The woman's already in a wheelchair.
SUPFEMALE:How much more damage could I do? Hi, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Why is your lipstick all smeared? I just kissed our driveway.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, everybody.
LEADMALE:Hello, Rose.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Would you consider teaching me how to drive? Sure, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:How about this.
SUPFEMALE:I teach you how to drive and you teach me how to be a great Italian cook? Everybody's a comedian today.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, everything okay down at the counseling center? Yes, finally.
SUPMALE:We had a manic depressive overload.
SUPFEMALE:Luckily Dr.
OTHERMALE:Ferguson had heard some new knock-knock jokes and that seemed to do the trick.
OTHERFEMALE:Knock-knock?
LEADFEMALE:Who's there? Oh, shut up, Rose! Hello, ladies.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Cousin Rose.
LEADMALE:Sven, hi.
LEADMALE:I want to do something special in honor of your wedding.
SUPMALE:What are you in the mood for? Oh, Cousin Rose, there isn't going to be a wedding.
SUPFEMALE:What? Why not? Because I decided I can't marry someone that I don't love.
LEADFEMALE:You've never even met Olga.
LEADFEMALE:How do you know you don't? Because I know I'm in love with someone else.
LEADMALE:I'm in love with Blanche.
LEADMALE:Swin, you can't be serious.
SUPFEMALE:You're not in love with me.
LEADFEMALE:Yes I am, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I know it's sudden, but I feel it in my heart.
LEADFEMALE:His father is gonna kill me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in charge of Sven for one day and he falls for the first little floozy that turns his head.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, did something happen between you and Sven that we don't know about? You didn't tell them about kissing me? Kissing him? Or stroking my hair? Stroking his hair? Or feeding me? All right, I'll say it.
SUPFEMALE:Feeding him? I can't hear any more of this.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, how could you do this to me? Rose, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I can explain everything.
LEADMALE:It's not like you think.
SUPMALE:If Sven said you kissed him, you kissed him.
SUPMALE:I did kiss him, but it was just pretend.
OTHERMALE:We were having lunch at Fairview Gardens.
LEADMALE:Well, Floyd McCallan walked in with another woman.
LEADMALE:So I pretended Swin was my boyfriend just to make Floyd jealous.
SUPMALE:Did you explain any of this to Sven? I assumed he knew.
LEADMALE:Blanche, how could you assume anything? The man offered to kill dinner for us last night.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I made a mistake, but I don't think I did anything so terrible.
LEADMALE:Well, I do! There is a sweet, innocent man whose heart is gonna get broken because you decided to use him in one of your petty games.
LEADMALE:That's only one side of it.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at the other side.
LEADFEMALE:He did get to kiss me.
LEADFEMALE:Big deal.
LEADFEMALE:More people get to kiss you than the Pope's ring.
LEADFEMALE:You have to go in there and talk to him.
LEADFEMALE:I will, I will.
SUPFEMALE:It's just that I'm not very good at it.
LEADMALE:I was blessed with one talent, turning men on.
LEADFEMALE:I've just never known how to turn them off.
SUPMALE:You tell him, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:I would, Blanche, but remember, we just want to turn him off, not drain the sex drive completely out of him! You know, I've always had this trouble ever since high school.
SUPFEMALE:I was the head cheerleader and I was dating our star quarterback, Calwell Honeycutt.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, time came to break up but I just could not tell Calwell to his face.
OTHERFEMALE:I couldn't bear to inflict that much grief and suffering on one man.
SUPFEMALE:So I finally decided that the best way to handle it was just to lead my girls in a farewell cheer.
LEADFEMALE:Two-four-six-eight, who will Blanche no longer date? Calwell.
LEADFEMALE:Did he get the message, or did the band have to spell out "buzz off' at half-time?  You have to go and set Sven straight.
OTHERMALE:The longer you wait, the harder it'll get.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:I will.
LEADMALE:Of course she's right.
SUPMALE:You know, I once made the same mistake myself.
LEADFEMALE:I was dating a guy my parents could not stand.
OTHERMALE:He used to come over to the house during Sunday dinner, help himself to some food, take it into the living room, turn on one of those radio countdown shows and belch to the music.
LEADFEMALE:Finally my mother told me that I just had to break it off and of course I knew she was right.
LEADFEMALE:So I rehearsed my speech and I made arrangements to meet him at a coffee shop.
LEADFEMALE:I got there five minutes early and caught him necking with a waitress.
LEADFEMALE:Oh!
LEADFEMALE:That must've made it easier.
LEADFEMALE:No, I still could not do it.
SUPMALE:How long had you been together with this guy? Thirty-eight years.
LEADMALE:That was Stan? And you know, to this day, he can belch out the chorus to Sweet Georgia Brown on one Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Pepper.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm gonna go talk to Swin.
LEADMALE:I'll just let him down gently.
LEADFEMALE:In the old country when a woman dumps a man, the man is allowed to shave the woman's head and make her wear an itchy hat.
LEADFEMALE:I hear Pakistan has the same penalty for jaywalking.
LEADFEMALE:Swin.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:Is something wrong? No, I'm just embarrassed about what happened before.
SUPMALE:Embarrassed? What for?
SUPMALE:For acting so crazy.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that wasn't crazy.
SUPMALE:Yes, we kissed one time, I let it go straight to my head.
OTHERMALE:I've been sitting here trying to understand what made me act that way.
LEADMALE:Could it be that I'm just nervous about getting married? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Or that I'm not used to being with a beautiful woman like you? Yes.
LEADMALE:Or that I'm just a naive, inexperienced man.
SUPMALE:Yes.
OTHERMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:It's none of those things, Blanche.
SUPMALE:It's because I like you.
OTHERMALE:I like everything about you.
LEADFEMALE:Swin.
LEADMALE:You hardly know me.
SUPMALE:I know enough.
SUPFEMALE:I know you're pretty.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:You're smart.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
OTHERMALE:Sexy.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Sophisticated.
SUPMALE:Yes No! Swin, there's something very important you don't know.
LEADMALE:Oh, I don't know how to say this.
OTHERFEMALE:Um, it's the reason I kissed you in the first place.
SUPMALE:To make Floyd jealous.
LEADMALE:You knew that?
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:And I think you had every right.
SUPMALE:He deserved it the way he's been rejecting you.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you mean rejecting me? Well, canceling twice in two days.
OTHERMALE:Then he shows up with that girl today.
LEADMALE:Woo!
SUPMALE:How old could she have been?
SUPMALE:Not very.
LEADMALE:You're not like most women, Blanche, I'll tell you that.
SUPMALE:What do you mean? Well, wouldn't most women let a thing like this make them feel old? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:And unattractive.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Worn out.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Useless.
LEADFEMALE:What's your point, Swin? My point is Well, I was just hoping that maybe you're tired of people like Floyd who don't appreciate you, and maybe you're ready to spend some time with someone who does.
SUPMALE:Like you.
LEADMALE:I know you don't know me very well yet, but I'm just asking for a chance.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, I'll think about it.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:You're welcome, Swin.
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Hi, Ma.
LEADMALE:Read it and weep.
SUPMALE:A driver's license? Ma, how did you get this? Hard work and determination.
LEADFEMALE:If you put your mind to it, you can do anything.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Ma, I absolutely forbid you to drive a car.
LEADMALE:Ooh, look, Dorothy, I'm shaking.
LEADMALE:Ma, I mean it! Lighten up.
LEADFEMALE:I told you before, I only want a license to have not to use.
LEADFEMALE:It's a symbol of my freedom, my independence.
OTHERFEMALE:Now give me 50 dollars.
OTHERFEMALE:What for? A guy named Paco makes these babies up in his garage.
LEADMALE:Good morning, girls.
LEADMALE:I didn't sleep a wink last night worrying about Blanche and Sven.
LEADMALE:Rose, this is between the two of them.
LEADMALE:No, it isn't.
LEADFEMALE:I'm supposed to get Sven on a plane today.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I called big Sven early this morning to ask him what to do.
SUPMALE:I knew he'd be up, he gets up with the cows.
LEADFEMALE:I know he gets up with the cows because he sleeps with the cows.
LEADMALE:What is your point, Rose? Big Sven was furious with me.
SUPFEMALE:He told me to do nothing, he'd handle everything.
LEADFEMALE:Then he hung up on me.
SUPFEMALE:Good morning!
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it is for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, Rose, you can't go on being mad at me over this.
SUPMALE:I feel just as bad as you do.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have an angry Viking yelling Scandinavian swear words at you on the phone this morning? My guess would be no.
SUPMALE:Rose, as I told you last night, your cousin is a very sensitive man.
SUPMALE:I just have to find the right time and place and I'll let him down softly.
SUPFEMALE:Morning, everyone.
LEADMALE:Who could that be?
OTHERFEMALE:Rose Nylund?
SUPMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Wow.
OTHERMALE:I'm Olga Nolstrom, from St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf.
OTHERMALE:I'm looking for Sven Linstrom.
LEADFEMALE:He's right there.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Sven, your father sent me.
LEADMALE:I was chosen to be your bride.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not leaving this house without you.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
OTHERMALE:Uh, now might be a good time to let him down softly.
LEADFEMALE:Our cab is waiting, Sven.
LEADMALE:Will you come? Blanche, I've done some thinking.
LEADFEMALE:I could never make you happy.
LEADMALE:If you could never make her happy, good luck with the lean, mean, Swedish machine.
LEADMALE:I understand, Swin.
LEADFEMALE:Go on.
LEADMALE:Go on.
LEADMALE:I'm coming, Olga.
LEADMALE:Oh, Cousin Rose, thank you! Thank you all.
LEADMALE:Oh, wait.
LEADFEMALE:What about my clothes? They're ugly.
LEADFEMALE:Any other questions? I'll send them to you.
LEADMALE:You two be on your way.
LEADFEMALE:Good luck!
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Bye! Oh, isn't that wonderful? Wonderful? He just dropped me! Oh, Blanche, come on.
LEADFEMALE:You had no interest in Sven.
LEADFEMALE:That's not the point, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:The point is for the second time in two days I have been thrown over for a younger woman.
LEADMALE:I can't I can't compete anymore.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, of course you can.
LEADFEMALE:You just have to compete in a different way, like, with intelligence and charm.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know those ways, Rose, and I'm too old to learn.
LEADFEMALE:I'm over the hill, that's all there is to it.
SUPMALE:I guess I'm just in the same boat as the two of you.
LEADMALE:Hello? Yes.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:What do you know.
SUPFEMALE:Floyd McCallan is taking me sailing today.
SUPFEMALE:I guess you two are in the same boat.
SUPMALE:I'm in the yacht.
LEADFEMALE:What's this boat she keeps talking about? Don't worry, Rose.
LEADMALE:You missed it.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Ma.
SUPMALE:Oh, something smells terrific.
OTHERMALE:What is it? Spaghetti sauce.
OTHERMALE:Here, have a taste.
LEADMALE:Mmm.
LEADMALE:Delicious.
SUPMALE:Delicious? This is the reason your father and I got married.
SUPMALE:Girls, do you realize it has been eight days since I've had a date? Do you realize it's been eight days since I had Ma, please.
LEADMALE:Whatever it is, keep it to yourself.
SUPFEMALE:That's my problem.
LEADMALE:I don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't seem to be able to attract as many men as I used to.
LEADMALE:Maybe it's just the beginning of the end.
LEADMALE:Maybe I'll never have another date again, as long as I live.
SUPMALE:Don't be ridiculous.
OTHERMALE:Not you, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:I am being ridiculous.
LEADMALE:If anybody never has another date, it'll probably be you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I feel so much better.
SUPMALE:Hi, girls.
LEADMALE:Guess what I'll be doing for three hours every Tuesday and Thursday night? Cutting up your black pantyhose and putting on an Amos 'n Andy puppet show? No, but what a great idea.
LEADMALE:Terrific, now you have something to do on Wednesdays.
LEADFEMALE:Okey-dokey.
LEADMALE:Do you know that promotion I was up for at the counseling center? Well, I found out I can't have it unless I become bilingual.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, honey, don't do that.
LEADMALE:No job is worth having to date women.
LEADMALE:Blanche, "bilingual" refers to a person who speaks more than one language.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Why'd I think it was something sexual? That's why I signed up for a Spanish class at night school.
SUPMALE:That's a wonderful idea.
OTHERMALE:Men go to night school.
LEADMALE:Smart men.
SUPMALE:And nothing turns me on more than a smart man.
LEADMALE:Unless maybe it's a stupid man with good hands.
LEADMALE:Rose, count me in.
LEADFEMALE:Dinner's ready.
OTHERFEMALE:What are we having?
LEADMALE:Spaghetti.
LEADFEMALE:Italian food? No, Rose, actually it's Chinese food.
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADMALE:I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Now that I'm taking Spanish, I'm gonna totally immerse myself in the culture.
LEADFEMALE:From now on, I'm only speaking Spanish.
SUPFEMALE:I'm eating Spanish food, I'm wearing Spanish clothes, and I'm re-reading the covers of my Julio Iglesias albums really, really carefully.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, Stan's here to see you.
OTHERMALE:Hi, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry to barge in on your meal.
OTHERMALE:It's all right.
OTHERFEMALE:Would you like some spaghetti?
SUPFEMALE:It's delicious.
LEADMALE:Did you make it?
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:I'd love some.
LEADFEMALE:Are you here for a reason or did you come for free food? Ma, please, the man is a guest in our home.
LEADMALE:What the hell do you want, Stanley? Well, it seems the IRS found a few discrepancies in my tax returns.
LEADMALE:So I think we may have a slight problem.
OTHERMALE:Stanley, we have not been together for a long time.
LEADMALE:Your tax return is your problem.
LEADMALE:Not exactly.
SUPFEMALE:They've decided to go over the returns for the last few years, and a few years ago, we were married.
SUPMALE:Babe, I'm afraid we're being audited.
LEADMALE:What?
SUPMALE:He said, "Babe, I'm afraid"
LEADFEMALE:I heard him, Rose! Just relax, Dorothy, sometimes they just randomly audit people.
LEADFEMALE:It doesn't mean there's a problem.
LEADMALE:There's a problem.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's too bad.
LEADMALE:Pass the meatballs.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I take total blame for this.
LEADFEMALE:I know it's a bummer, but no matter what comes down, we're in this together.
LEADFEMALE:I won't know till we reconstruct our finances, but I figure we probably have to pay a small fee.
LEADFEMALE:That doesn't sound so bad.
OTHERFEMALE:Unless we get a prison term.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, I'll come by tomorrow night, we'll sit down and go over all the receipts.
LEADFEMALE:Pass the
LEADFEMALE:I will not.
LEADMALE:Now get out, Stanley.
LEADMALE:Calm down.
LEADFEMALE:I can eat it plain.
LEADFEMALE:Well, gotta go now.
LEADFEMALE:See you tomorrow night.
LEADMALE:I can't believe this is happening.
SUPFEMALE:Our whole married life, I was so careful about money.
OTHERMALE:And all the time, Stanley had his hand in the cookie jar.
OTHERMALE:In the olden days, the Vikings would cut off your hand if they caught you stealing.
LEADFEMALE:They'd cut out your tongue if they caught you lying.
LEADFEMALE:They'd cut off your feet if they caught you trespassing.
LEADMALE:Too bad there wasn't a Viking around when Stan knocked you up.
LEADFEMALE:That means "Hello Dorothy" in Spanish.
LEADFEMALE:You've really taken command of the language, haven't you? Si.
OTHERMALE:That means "yes.
SUPFEMALE:" Gee, Rose, if I closed my eyes, I'd swear I was in Ecuador.
LEADMALE:Sorry, that was me.
LEADMALE:Okay, Rose, I'm ready for class.
SUPMALE:You look like you're going to a cocktail party.
LEADMALE:Well, gracias, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, it's me, Stan.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so thoughtful of you to bring garbage.
LEADFEMALE:These are my tax receipts.
LEADMALE:Our future is in this bag.
LEADFEMALE:How appropriate.
SUPMALE:Hi, girls.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Stan.
SUPMALE:Blanche, you look great in that blouse.
OTHERFEMALE:Are those new? I mean Is that new? Stanley, you naughty boy.
LEADFEMALE:When was the last time somebody gave you a spanking? Vegas.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Blanche, we don't wanna be late.
LEADMALE:Oh, darn, I keep forgetting.
LEADMALE:I'm not supposed to speak English.
LEADFEMALE:Being bilingual really gets me confused.
SUPMALE:Ziploc bags get you confused.
LEADMALE:See you girls later.
LEADMALE:Adiós.
LEADMALE:Sophia, you look younger than ever.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Stan.
SUPMALE:That's a beautiful toupee you're wearing.
SUPFEMALE:There, now we're both liars.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Stan, let's get this over with.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, okay, here's a copy of the tax return.
LEADFEMALE:We'll go over each deduction individually and document it with a receipt.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:What the hell is this? Oh, uh, that It's a business loss.
SUPMALE:I made a bad investment.
LEADFEMALE:What investment? You never told me you were investing.
SUPMALE:Well, I actually wasn't planning to, but I knew this was a money maker the minute I laid eyes on it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm talking tie bibs, babe.
LEADMALE:Tie bibs.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Little bibs that fit over your necktie.
LEADMALE:You go out to lunch, you don't worry about staining your tie.
LEADFEMALE:It's a perfect gift, a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:And the best part was, no one else had ever thought of it.
SUPFEMALE:To this day, I don't know why I couldn't sell them.
LEADMALE:Did you ever hear of napkins, Stanley? Hey.
LEADFEMALE:So I didn't make the cover of Fortune.
OTHERMALE:I was just trying to do something to make things better for us.
LEADFEMALE:All our friends were moving up, and we were stuck with a one-way ticket to Palookaville.
LEADMALE:I wanted to be someone, babe.
SUPFEMALE:I wanted to be a contender.
SUPMALE:Stanley, did you just rent On the Waterfront? You know me so well.
SUPMALE:No, I don't.
SUPFEMALE:What is this $2500 deduction for a gift? This is a receipt for the diamond ring that you gave me on our I know.
LEADFEMALE:You spent $2500 on me? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Figured after 38 years, you deserve something major.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I know we've had our differences, but you've always stuck by me when it really counted.
LEADFEMALE:I'll always love you for that.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank you, Stanley.
OTHERFEMALE:Stanley, what are all these deductions for a Corvette and a rented garage? Dorothy, don't get mad.
LEADMALE:And don't hit me if you do.
LEADFEMALE:I kind of bought a Corvette without telling you.
LEADFEMALE:You bought a car without telling me? I was going through a mid-life crisis.
LEADFEMALE:So was I.
LEADFEMALE:I gave myself a perm and took up Jazzercise.
LEADMALE:You bought a car without telling me? How can I explain it? When I sat behind the wheel, people noticed me.
SUPFEMALE:People paid attention.
SUPFEMALE:That car was a chick magnet.
LEADMALE:That is it, Stanley.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
OTHERFEMALE:Get out.
SUPMALE:Get out of my house.
OTHERFEMALE:Get out of my life.
OTHERFEMALE:What about the audit? We can get into trouble.
LEADMALE:We could wind up in jail.
LEADMALE:Good, good.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to go to jail.
SUPMALE:And I want a big bald convict named Bubba to pick you for his girlfriend.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, you don't mean that.
LEADFEMALE:The hell I don't.
LEADMALE:This is all your fault.
OTHERMALE:Look, it doesn't matter who's to blame here.
SUPMALE:We're in this together.
SUPFEMALE:If you don't wanna cooperate,
SUPFEMALE:you're gonna be hurting yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:And I hate you for it.
LEADFEMALE:What's all the racket? Oh, nothing.
SUPMALE:I could just murder Stan.
LEADFEMALE:He bought a Corvette without telling me.
LEADMALE:Why are you complaining? Your father did things without telling me.
OTHERFEMALE:How do you think I got pregnant with your brother Phil? Just remember, I'll handle everything.
OTHERMALE:I'm a salesman.
SUPFEMALE:I deal with people.
LEADFEMALE:I know what I'm doing.
LEADMALE:Shut up, Stanley.
SUPMALE:Mellow out.
SUPMALE:Once we get in there, we have to exercise psychological control.
SUPMALE:That's why I'm wearing this suit.
SUPFEMALE:You make me sick.
LEADMALE:Hey, everyone knows good guys wear white.
SUPFEMALE:This suit subliminally tells the auditor I'm a good guy.
LEADMALE:I could vomit just looking at you.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:And Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Zbornak, step into my office, please.
LEADFEMALE:Watch me work my magic, babe.
SUPFEMALE:Good afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:I am Wendell Murray.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be conducting your audit.
LEADFEMALE:Nice to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
OTHERMALE:This is my ex-husband, Stanley.
OTHERMALE:Wendell.
SUPMALE:Paisan.
OTHERMALE:We're going to jail.
LEADFEMALE:What did you call me? Before he answers that, let me reiterate, we are bitterly divorced.
SUPMALE:Relax, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Wendell, I called you "paisan.
SUPFEMALE:" Friend, brother of the scalp.
LEADMALE:If I may get philosophical for one moment, I've always believed we bald men are like any other minority.
LEADMALE:That's why we have to stick together.
LEADFEMALE:Who you calling bald? Nobody, nobody.
SUPFEMALE:Just shut up and put your hair on.
OTHERMALE:Yes, dear.
SUPFEMALE:Wendell, if I may call you Wendell, did I mention that I'm a member of the Rainbow Coalition? Mr.
LEADMALE:And Mrs.
SUPMALE:Zbornak, may I remind you that as an employee of the IRS, it is my sole obligation to see that the government gets all the money it has coming to it?
LEADMALE:And I'll bet you do a fine job of it.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:However, I have no personal stake in this whatsoever.
SUPFEMALE:Is that understood?
LEADMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:You bet, my man.
LEADMALE:Then cut the crap, paisan.
SUPMALE:You know, folks, I've been at this job almost four years now, and in that short time I can honestly say I have never seen such an inept, clumsy, downright stupid attempt to avoid paying income tax.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:That means a lot coming from you.
SUPFEMALE:I can also honestly say that I'm amazed the way this lays out, you only owe a small amount.
OTHERMALE:You're kidding.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:$5000.
LEADMALE:$5000 We don't have that kind of money.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Sam doesn't like to hear that.
LEADMALE:Aunt Dorothy doesn't enjoy saying it.
LEADFEMALE:We'll expect you each to cough up $2500 in 30 days.
LEADMALE:What if we can't? We'll put a lien on your bank accounts, property, and your salaries.
OTHERFEMALE:And if that doesn't work, we'll just have to incarcerate you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:We're going to jail.
LEADMALE:That's right, Stanley.
SUPMALE:Please, let me know where you and Bubba register for your china.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, honey, what are you still doing up? Studying for my Spanish test.
LEADMALE:Like somebody else I know should be.
LEADMALE:Don't strain yourself.
LEADMALE:Here.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, these are the answers to the test.
SUPMALE:Where did you get these? I'll give you one guess.
SUPMALE:You slept with the teacher.
LEADMALE:Of course I didn't sleep with the teacher.
OTHERFEMALE:You have to be very careful these days.
SUPFEMALE:I promised I would if he gave me the answers.
OTHERMALE:I call it "safe-teasing.
LEADMALE:" Well, you can just have them back.
LEADFEMALE:I've only cheated once in my life.
LEADFEMALE:I vowed I'd never do it again.
OTHERMALE:Couldn't handle the guilt? No, I got caught.
LEADMALE:Oh, it was the worst experience of my whole life.
LEADMALE:St.
SUPMALE:Olaf was rocked by the scandal.
LEADFEMALE:What'd you do, shortchange somebody down at the feed store? Worse.
LEADMALE:I fed BB's to my prize lamb, Harlan, so he'd weigh in heavier at the county fair.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God, Rose.
LEADMALE:How do you sleep at night? I knew it was wrong all along, but I wanted to win first prize.
LEADFEMALE:And I would have if Harlan could have held it just a little longer.
SUPMALE:Boy, did you just miss a real gem.
OTHERFEMALE:Poor Dorothy, what are you doing up again? I can't sleep.
SUPFEMALE:Every time I close my eyes, I see Uncle Sam going through my purse.
OTHERMALE:Worried about the money you owe the government? No, Blanche, I'm worried about whether Michael Jackson will be able to buy the remains of the Elephant Man.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Gee, I'd be worried about the money.
SUPMALE:Does anyone around here ever go to bed? I can't sleep, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:I can't work, I can't eat.
OTHERMALE:All I can do is think about how I'm gonna raise the rest of that 2500 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:I wish I had it, pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know, Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:If you had it, you'd give it to me.
SUPFEMALE:Don't put words in my mouth.
LEADMALE:I said, "I wish I had it.
SUPMALE:" I've put away a little money, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:It's not nearly enough, but you're welcome to it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:I could lend you a couple of hundred.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd planned on putting it toward my cruise to the Bahamas,
LEADFEMALE:but what the heck?
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you, girls.
LEADMALE:I'll just buy a couple I really appreciate this.
LEADMALE:And limbo under the clothesline.
LEADFEMALE:But I can't accept it.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:I only have half of the 2500.
OTHERFEMALE:And since I don't qualify for a bank loan, I'm just gonna have to sell some of my stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Hold it.
OTHERMALE:No daughter of mine is selling her stuff.
LEADFEMALE:It's a sin, it's a crime, and let's face it, Dorothy, lately you can't give it away.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, I'm talking about selling some of my belongings.
LEADMALE:I called a couple of pawn shops and I'm gonna check them out tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:I'm wonderful at bargaining.
LEADMALE:I'll go with you.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thanks, girls.
SUPMALE:Oh You know, I can't believe this is happening.
LEADFEMALE:I was so careful about my finances all my life.
SUPFEMALE:I thought that by now I'd have some sort of security.
SUPMALE:And here I am, flat broke.
SUPFEMALE:I know what you mean.
LEADMALE:I never dreamt I'd be single and working at this age.
LEADFEMALE:I never dreamt I'd be this age.
LEADMALE:Let me tell you girls the three most important things I learned about life.
LEADFEMALE:Number 
LEADMALE:Hold fast to your friends.
LEADMALE:Number 
SUPFEMALE:There's no such thing as security.
LEADMALE:And number 
OTHERFEMALE:Don't go see Ishtar.
LEADMALE:Now girls, listen.
LEADMALE:Listen.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, the way to make a deal is we state our price, stick to our guns, and undo another button on our blouses.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, that is ridiculous.
LEADMALE:Unbuttoning my blouse is not gonna get us a better deal.
LEADFEMALE:You are absolutely right.
LEADMALE:Don't touch yours.
OTHERMALE:Rose and I will unbutton ours.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Please, don't hurt me, just take my money.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I think I got my verbs mixed up.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot, lady.
LEADMALE:So, what do you want? I would like to pawn a few things.
LEADMALE:You got a lot of things here.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:So, uh, how much will you give me? $100 for everything.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Sir! I am shocked at your insensitivity.
LEADFEMALE:May I point out to you that this is no ordinary pitcher? This pitcher was carried thousands of miles across the ocean by her great-great-grandmother.
OTHERFEMALE:A woman who came to this country in search of a better life, as have done millions of immigrants throughout history.
LEADFEMALE:Why, this pitcher is a symbol of freedom.
SUPFEMALE:This pitcher is a symbol of liberty.
OTHERMALE:This pitcher was made in Taiwan.
LEADMALE:Well! Maybe they stopped off at the Ellis Island gift shop.
LEADFEMALE:The point is, this pitcher is worth a considerable amount of money.
SUPMALE:Lady, that story is worth more than the pitcher.
LEADMALE:In fact, except for the ring that you are wearing, nothing that you brought in here is worth anything.
SUPFEMALE:How much for the ring?
LEADFEMALE:$800.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I couldn't pawn this.
SUPMALE:$900.
LEADFEMALE:Take it, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:No, I couldn't, it This is the only nice thing that Stan ever gave me.
SUPFEMALE:$1000.
OTHERMALE:It's also the only valuable thing.
LEADFEMALE:Hock it.
SUPMALE:I can't.
LEADMALE:$1200.
LEADFEMALE:My final offer.
LEADFEMALE:No, this isn't for sale.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, there are some things that have no price.
LEADFEMALE:I This means a lot to me.
LEADMALE:My husband gave it to me after 38 years of marriage.
LEADMALE:And after 38 years of marriage, he also dumped you for a 23-year-old stewardess with firm thighs and perky breasts.
SUPFEMALE:You got yourself a ring, muchacho.
LEADFEMALE:Hi Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:What are you two doing here? I thought you had Spanish class.
LEADMALE:We do but we're not going.
LEADMALE:We dropped out.
SUPMALE:What about your promotion at the counseling center? Oh, I can just forget about that.
LEADMALE:Norwegians are notoriously bad at Spanish.
LEADMALE:I guess that's why there are no herring tacos.
LEADMALE:And it was a big waste of my time.
SUPMALE:There was only one cute guy there.
LEADFEMALE:And he kept doodling the name "Kenny" in his notebook.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in.
LEADMALE:I have the check for my half of the money.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, girls.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Stan.
SUPMALE:Hi, Stan.
LEADMALE:Where's your hair? Oh, damn.
LEADMALE:I never should have opened that sunroof.
LEADFEMALE:This just isn't my week.
LEADMALE:Here you go.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Uh, Dorothy, uh, listen.
LEADFEMALE:I, um I'm really sorry about all of this.
LEADFEMALE:It's all my fault.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:A little something for you.
SUPFEMALE:My ring.
LEADMALE:I didn't want you to sell it.
LEADMALE:Not like this.
SUPMALE:How did you know?
LEADFEMALE:I called while you were out.
LEADMALE:Sophia told me what happened, so I went and bought it back.
SUPFEMALE:Stanley, you didn't have to do that.
LEADMALE:I wanted to do it, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Because, in spite of everything, you're still the best.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'm gonna cry.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, don't do that.
LEADMALE:Your eyes will get all beady, and your nose will swell up like Karl Malden.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute, if you bought the ring back, how did you come up with the money? Sold the Corvette.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it was tough.
SUPMALE:I had great times with that car, but the times I had with you were a hell of a lot more important.
LEADMALE:Oh, Stanley.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so sorry.
SUPMALE:Me too.
SUPMALE:I guess I became what I always feared 
LEADFEMALE:Another middle-aged bald guy who drives a Toyota.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Stanley, this This is the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go down to Riley's and see if we can meet some men.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:If you're taking Biscayne Blvd.
LEADMALE:, keep an eye out for my hair.
LEADFEMALE:We, um, really pulled it out of the fire, didn't we, babe? We sure did.
SUPMALE:It felt nice, you and me, working as a team again.
SUPMALE:It did feel nice.
LEADFEMALE:Reminds me of when we were first married.
LEADMALE:We sure had some good times.
LEADMALE:So, as long as I'm here, what do you say, for old time's sake, you wanna go to bed?  Dorothy! Dorothy, let go, it was a joke.
LEADFEMALE:You're hurting me.
SUPFEMALE:You're really hurting me.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:Oh, hello.
LEADFEMALE:We have a 2:00 appointment with Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley.
LEADMALE:The name is Zbornak.
LEADMALE:My name's not Zbornak.
SUPMALE:My name is Devereaux.
LEADFEMALE:But the appointment is in the name of Zbornak.
LEADFEMALE:Why your name? It was my idea to get counseling.
SUPMALE:Take the appointment for Zbornak and change it to Nylund.
SUPMALE:You satisfied? The appointment should be under Devereaux.
LEADFEMALE:Under Nylund.
LEADFEMALE:Change it back to Zbornak.
OTHERMALE:Put it under Lipschitz and buzz the head shrinker.
LEADFEMALE:We got an emergency here.
OTHERMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Ladies.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Dr.
LEADMALE:Ashley.
OTHERMALE:Come into my office.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm Sophia Petrillo, and my idea of a good psychiatrist is a bartender who pours without a spout.
LEADFEMALE:Doctor, I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
LEADMALE:Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I'm Rose Nylund.
SUPFEMALE:Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Blanche Devereaux.
LEADMALE:It's not pertinent at the moment, but I'm double-jointed.
LEADFEMALE:That's very interesting.
SUPMALE:Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, the reason we came is that we're roommates having problems at home that we need to work out.
LEADFEMALE:Before we get to the nitty-gritty, tell me a little about yourselves.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:I'm a teacher.
LEADMALE:I'm divorced.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a widow.
LEADMALE:No man would leave me unless he absolutely had to.
LEADFEMALE:I'm 41 years old, I'm 5'6", I weigh 108 pounds, and my hair is its natural hue.
LEADMALE:Sure, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Yours and Lucy's.
LEADFEMALE:What about you, Rose? Well, to be perfectly honest, I use a touch of peroxide.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, shut up, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:You shut up.
SUPFEMALE:Now, stop it.
LEADMALE:Stop it! I cannot stand it anymore! You know what I can't stand? That phony accent of yours.
OTHERFEMALE:What is this, Designing Women? We have been together for five years.
OTHERMALE:We're getting on each other's nerves.
OTHERMALE:Why is that?
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy is impossible to live with.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:The real problem is you, Blanche.
LEADMALE:You are selfish.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, please.
LEADMALE:Everybody says what a giving person I am.
SUPMALE:She's talking about when you're in an upright position.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, give an example of how Blanche is selfish.
LEADMALE:All right, fine.
SUPMALE:Let's say, oh, about a month ago, I was not feeling very well.
OTHERMALE:I was sick as a dog.
LEADMALE:I'll be ready in a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I had Hannah do my makeup while my pedicure was drying, so all I have to do is change my shoes.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? I think I'm dying.
SUPMALE:But then again, this 104 fever may be clouding my judgment.
SUPMALE:Look at what you're wearing.
OTHERMALE:You can't go like that.
LEADMALE:I think the funeral home has someone who handles that, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:But thank you for caring.
LEADMALE:I'm talking about our double date.
LEADFEMALE:Good grief! This place looks like a hospital ward.
SUPMALE:Mike and Larry will be here any minute.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I can't go out tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Look at me.
LEADMALE:But, Dorothy, you've looked much worse than this.
LEADMALE:Remember that time you gave yourself a home perm, burnt your hair right down to the roots and ended up looking like Buckwheat? I meant, Blanche, that I am sick.
OTHERMALE:I can barely stand.
LEADMALE:You'll just have to go on without me.
OTHERFEMALE:Go on without you? This is not a wagon train.
SUPFEMALE:This is a double date.
LEADMALE:It doesn't work that way.
LEADMALE:It's both of us or nothing.
LEADMALE:You'll just have to cancel your date, too.
LEADMALE:Cancel my date? With Larry? Dorothy, how long have you been inhaling this VapoRub? Blanche Dorothy, I have been waiting for Larry to ask me out ever since our eyes first met at Del's Route 1 Chevron.
OTHERMALE:I climbed on the hood of his LeBaron and wrote my phone number on his windshield with the heel of my Pappagallo pump.
SUPMALE:Isn't that how Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Simpson met the Duke of Windsor? You promised you would double-date with Larry's friend Mike.
SUPFEMALE:I am holding you to that promise.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I'm sick.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you just have a cold.
LEADMALE:See? You just have a little tickle in your throat.
SUPMALE:All right, come on! Let's go!
LEADMALE:Blanche, please! Please! My body aches.
SUPFEMALE:So does mine, honey.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I wanna go out on this date.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I am miserable! It is mind over matter.
LEADMALE:Now, you can do it.
LEADFEMALE:You can get up.
LEADMALE:You feel better already.
SUPMALE:You're not sick anymore.
LEADFEMALE:You can heal yourself! Walk, Dorothy! Walk! Just because you put your makeup on with a butter knife doesn't make you Tammy Bakker.
LEADMALE:Oh, forget it, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna kill myself because you have the hots for some guy in a fancy car.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, Larry is very important to me.
LEADFEMALE:You picked him up at a gas station.
LEADFEMALE:He must've been impressed with your spare tire.
SUPFEMALE:I cannot believe you are doing this.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe you are so selfish.
LEADFEMALE:Pussycat, drink this.
LEADMALE:It'll make you feel better.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma, another hot toddy? I think I've had enough.
SUPFEMALE:Shut up and drink.
SUPFEMALE:This is the fourth one.
SUPFEMALE:That's a lot of whiskey.
LEADMALE:I only put whiskey in the first one.
LEADFEMALE:We ran out.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:The second and third were vodka.
SUPFEMALE:No wonder my head is spinning.
LEADMALE:This one's part Amaretto, part Sambuca.
LEADMALE:That should kill everything.
LEADFEMALE:Killed your father.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy? Dorothy! She's out cold.
LEADFEMALE:The fever takes a lot out of you.
LEADMALE:Sophia, help me get her into the bedroom.
LEADFEMALE:She's comfortable here.
SUPMALE:Oh, all right.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll just prop her up a little.
LEADMALE:Mike's not that particular.
LEADFEMALE:He just got out of prison.
SUPMALE:It was absolutely dreadful.
LEADMALE:I spent the evening going in and out of consciousness while a guy with a silver tooth and a scorpion tattoo on his arm tried to grope me through the Vicks VapoRub.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, stop your complaining.
LEADFEMALE:Mike was a very nice man.
LEADMALE:He burned down a diner in Arkansas because his eggs were runny.
LEADMALE:Blanche, you owe Dorothy an apology.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you tell me to shut up.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, I will.
SUPMALE:Shut up, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:You see the way they pick on me? They're always telling me to shut up.
SUPMALE:Why is that?
LEADMALE:Well, it could be
LEADFEMALE:Every time I open my mouth,
LEADFEMALE:Rose
LEADMALE:they jump on me.
SUPMALE:They say I babble.
LEADFEMALE:I don't babble.
SUPMALE:People who babble Shut up, Rose! I mean I think things would be more productive if we conducted things in a more orderly fashion.
OTHERMALE:But you see what we put up with.
OTHERFEMALE:She's an airhead.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? Well, you're a barbell.
LEADFEMALE:That's a dumbbell, you twit! Ladies, ladies, please calm down.
LEADMALE:Who can give us an example that will illustrate exactly what you're trying to say about Rose? I've got the perfect example.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy was on vacation, looking for a part-time job, so she asks Rose to put her ad in the classifieds.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that was a mistake to begin with right away.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, it is not here.
LEADMALE:Look again.
SUPFEMALE:It has to be.
LEADMALE:I have read every want ad in the paper.
SUPFEMALE:Mine is not here.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you sure you dropped it at the newspaper? You told me what you wanted me to do a dozen times.
LEADMALE:Any idiot could've done it.
OTHERMALE:I know, but you were the only one going downtown.
SUPFEMALE:Are you sure that you dropped it off at the newspaper office? Yes.
OTHERMALE:Six people called while you were out.
LEADMALE:Give that to me.
SUPMALE:I'll try and find it for you.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Dorothy?
LEADMALE:Have we met? Not yet.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm here because of your ad in the 
OTHERMALE:"Willing to do anything, $8.
LEADFEMALE:00 an hour, no job too big or small.
SUPMALE:" Of course.
SUPFEMALE:Please come in.
LEADMALE:I didn't expect people to actually come here.
LEADMALE:I just figured that I would be going to them.
LEADMALE:That's the way it'll work in the future when my video camera gets back from the shop.
SUPMALE:What type of work is it that you need done, Mr
SUPFEMALE:Toto.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Toto.
LEADMALE:Oh, no "Mister.
LEADMALE:" Just Toto.
LEADMALE:You're Dorothy, and I'm Toto.
LEADFEMALE:At least for the next $8.
OTHERMALE:00.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, you owe me an apology.
LEADMALE:Your ad's right here.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose, this is the personals column.
OTHERMALE:So what?
LEADFEMALE:So what? You put an ad in the personals that said I will do anything for $8.
SUPMALE:00 an hour? Look.
SUPMALE:It's right under an ad that reads, "History professor seeking nonsmoking Oriental woman "who is into Wesson Oil and bears a resemblance to Florence Henderson.
SUPMALE:"
LEADFEMALE:Is that signed "Doug"?
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:I know him.
SUPMALE:He's a sick man.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm terribly sorry for this mix-up.
LEADMALE:Good-bye.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God! I don't believe this! I'm going to call the cops if you don't get out of here, you pervert! Hi, Father Rossi.
LEADFEMALE:Here's the canned goods for the needy.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
LEADMALE:I promise I will say Hail Mary's until Madonna has a hit movie.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Here's my $8.
SUPMALE:00.
SUPFEMALE:Let's get started, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm not Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:She is.
SUPFEMALE:I'll give $4.
LEADMALE:00.
SUPMALE:Let's get started.
LEADMALE:How would you like your rear end kicked across the street? Great! Here's the other $4.
LEADMALE:00! Girls! Girls! There is a busload of Greek sailors out front.
LEADFEMALE:They wanna know how many drachma there are in $8.
OTHERMALE:00.
SUPFEMALE:It didn't turn out well, but it was an honest mistake.
LEADMALE:Besides, something good came out of it.
SUPMALE:We learned to make souvlaki.
LEADMALE:Rose, you do this kind of stupid thing all the time.
SUPMALE:If you're not doing something stupid, you're wearing something stupid or cooking something stupid.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, what do you think of Blanche saying these things? I think she's a garconanokin.
LEADFEMALE:What exactly does that mean? Literally, it's the precise moment when dog doo turns white.
LEADMALE:But in general, it refers to the kind of person you don't wanna share your hoogencoggles with.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, if you say one more of those stupid words
LEADMALE:Blow it out your tubenburbles!
LEADMALE:If I have to live with her one more week Ladies! Ladies, please! We're not going to get anything more accomplished unless you sit down, take it easy and discuss this rationally using only English words.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, we talked about Rose.
LEADFEMALE:We talked about Blanche.
SUPMALE:Nobody has said a word about Dorothy.
LEADMALE:They're afraid of her.
SUPFEMALE:We are not.
LEADMALE:But we do have a problem with her.
LEADFEMALE:What specifically is it about Dorothy that is disruptive to the household? It's nothing specific.
OTHERFEMALE:It's her entire general attitude.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, like that time a couple weeks ago, week before last.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Come in.
SUPMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, hi, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:How's the studying going? I have a lot to cover.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna be up for a while.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:I'll keep you company.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want any company.
LEADFEMALE:Just pretend I'm not here.
LEADMALE:Oh, goody.
OTHERMALE:A slumber party.
LEADFEMALE:Mind if I join you? What is the matter with you two? Something's the matter? Okay, I wanna see six hands above that blanket right now! The only reason we're in bed with Dorothy is we're scared.
LEADMALE:Scared? Of what? Dorothy, don't you laugh, but we're scared of the aliens.
LEADFEMALE:How many times have I told you not to call them "the aliens"? They are the Chungs, and they happen to be very nice.
LEADFEMALE:They're not very nice.
LEADMALE:They eat dogs.
SUPMALE:Ma, they do not eat dogs.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:It's just a coincidence that not one ever pees on their lawn.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you made that up.
OTHERMALE:Sophia, we're not talking about them anyway.
SUPMALE:We're talking about aliens from space.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, those aliens.
LEADMALE:Get out, both of you! Have a heart.
OTHERMALE:Rose and I rented that movie Aliens, and it just scared us half to death.
LEADFEMALE:Scared me, too.
LEADMALE:That Sigourney Weaver's a sweet girl, but she really shouldn't go without makeup.
OTHERMALE:I don't have time for this! Now, I have my education exam tomorrow morning.
LEADMALE:You're kicking us out?
LEADFEMALE:Rose, I have to study.
LEADFEMALE:That's my Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Always with her nose in a book.
LEADMALE:Unlike your brother Phil, who was with his nose in the dirty clothes hamper.
OTHERFEMALE:I cannot believe you would be so cold-blooded as to cast out your two dearest friends in this, their time of need.
LEADMALE:I can't believe that the two of you are so inconsiderate you would disturb me with something ridiculous when you know how important my exam is.
SUPMALE:If I don't pass, I don't get my raise.
SUPMALE:That's it.
OTHERFEMALE:Everybody out.
OTHERMALE:Sophia, we're scared! I'm scared we won't be able to afford meat on the table.
SUPFEMALE:You wanna wind up swapping recipes with the Chungs? Out! Out!
SUPFEMALE:Ladies, I'm not sure I understand.
LEADFEMALE:What I mean is Dorothy was perfectly reasonable.
SUPFEMALE:She was more than patient.
SUPFEMALE:Exactly.
LEADMALE:And I've had it up to here with her.
SUPFEMALE:It's not easy living with somebody who's always so together.
SUPFEMALE:She's so efficient, so organized.
LEADMALE:She even balances her checkbook.
SUPMALE:Since when is competence a crime? Look, Dorothy cannot be blamed for being capable.
OTHERMALE:She doesn't have to lord it over us and criticize us for not living up to her standards.
LEADFEMALE:She's always harping on us to do everything just right.
LEADMALE:I'm surprised she doesn't check our underwear before we leave the house.
SUPMALE:Those of you who wear underwear.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I am a perfectionist and maybe I do take charge, but if I did not, our whole household would fall apart.
SUPMALE:To tell you the truth, Doctor, I'm the glue that keeps these women together, and I am totally unappreciated.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma, please! Look, you may be smart, but I'm wise.
LEADFEMALE:When it comes to a real problem, I'm the one who has to set it straight.
LEADMALE:Let me tell you a little story, Doctor.
LEADMALE:Sophia, are you busy? No.
SUPMALE:Just drawing a line on the Milk of Magnesia bottle.
SUPMALE:Why? I think the gardener's been sneaking a few sips.
LEADMALE:I have a problem.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Take a sip.
SUPFEMALE:I'll draw another line.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:It's not that.
LEADFEMALE:My boss at the center made a pass at me.
LEADMALE:Maybe you misunderstood.
OTHERMALE:What did he do? He called me in his office, threw me on the couch and kissed me.
LEADMALE:That's a pass.
LEADMALE:Okay, I think I can help you.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you a story, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Picture 
LEADFEMALE:Sicily, 1922.
OTHERFEMALE:Sophia, I have a problem.
LEADFEMALE:I saw the guy I've been dating out with another woman.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think I oughta do?
SUPMALE:Sit down and picture Sicily, 1922.
LEADFEMALE:It was the worst of times, it was the worst of times.
LEADFEMALE:It was Sicily, 1922.
SUPMALE:Oh, Ma, I have a problem.
LEADMALE:Just sit down and listen.
LEADMALE:First, is everyone who lives in this house here at this moment?
LEADMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Then for the last time, picture 
LEADFEMALE:Sicily, 1922.
SUPMALE:A beautiful young woman with breasts not unlike Brigitte Nielsen, except hers moved when she skipped, she comes walking down a picturesque country road when suddenly a yellow Rolls-Royce pulls up and blocks her path.
LEADMALE:Oh! Who was in the Rolls? Robert Goulet, for all I know.
OTHERMALE:It's not important to the story.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, the Rolls-Royce moves on, and the girl finds her pepperoni is missing.
LEADMALE:What happened to it, Sophia?
LEADMALE:Bambi ate it.
LEADMALE:How should I know? You keep missing the point.
SUPMALE:The thing is, she has no pepperoni to bring to her family's table.
LEADMALE:She gets hysterical.
LEADMALE:She starts to run.
SUPFEMALE:She runs through the field, the meadow, over the hill until she comes to a raging river filled with pepperoni swimming upstream.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, pepperoni swimming upstream? I know it's odd.
LEADMALE:Pepperoni is a land meat, but there it was.
LEADFEMALE:She wades into the river, grabs an armful and races home to feed her family.
LEADMALE:When she tells the story, they think it's an act of God.
LEADMALE:But as it turned out, a disgruntled pepperoni stuffer had blown up the factory in a neighboring town, causing pepperoni to rain down over a hundred square miles, which is where the Sicilian saying "It's raining cats and pepperoni" comes from.
LEADFEMALE:Is this helping anyone yet? Because this sure feels like an ending to me.
SUPFEMALE:It's helping me, Sophia.
OTHERMALE:What I got out of the story was that I should take a bad situation and make it better.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna tell my boss off.
SUPFEMALE:That's not what I got out of it.
LEADFEMALE:You were trying to tell me to dump my boyfriend because there's lots of pepperoni in the sea.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I was trying to tell you.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, did I help with your problem? You sure did.
SUPMALE:I didn't know what to have for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:How about splitting a pepperoni pizza? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:You buying? Does a pepperoni swim upstream? Did once.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid I don't understand, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:They look up to you.
OTHERMALE:They seek your advice.
SUPFEMALE:They respect your opinion.
OTHERFEMALE:What exactly is your complaint? That I don't get $150 an hour like you.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think we should do? In my experience, most domestic problems can usually be resolved through a willingness to cooperate and hard work.
LEADFEMALE:You're saying if we become more tolerant of each other, we can work things out? In your case, there's really no point.
LEADMALE:You are totally incompatible.
LEADFEMALE:What? You are incompatible.
SUPFEMALE:You bring out the worst traits in each other.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm surprised you were able to live together this long without killing each other.
LEADFEMALE:But, Dr.
LEADMALE:Ashley, we came here for you to help us.
SUPFEMALE:Ladies, I like you.
LEADFEMALE:Save your money for the moving expenses.
SUPMALE:Well, thank you, Doctor.
OTHERMALE:It was difficult to hear, but  you're probably right.
LEADMALE:I knew you were a quack.
OTHERFEMALE:A legitimate shrink would've strung us along for months.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, I guess tomorrow morning we can start to pack, can't we? Yeah, I guess so.
OTHERMALE:That's probably the best thing.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley was right, wasn't he? Oh, absolutely.
OTHERFEMALE:'Cause It doesn't mean we can't still be friends.
LEADMALE:You know, we'll visit each other.
SUPMALE:It's just that we can't live together.
LEADMALE:Right? What's going on? We were just discussing going our separate ways.
LEADMALE:Interesting.
LEADFEMALE:You think that's what we should do?
LEADFEMALE:I didn't say that.
LEADFEMALE:You think we should stay together.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't say that either.
LEADFEMALE:What should we do? It's not for me to say.
LEADFEMALE:But I'll tell you a story.
LEADMALE:Picture 
OTHERFEMALE:Miami, 1987.
LEADFEMALE:A house, the only one in the neighborhood without a pool.
LEADMALE:But I digress.
LEADMALE:Four women, friends.
LEADMALE:They laugh, they cry, they eat.
LEADFEMALE:They love, they hate, they eat.
SUPMALE:They dream, they hope, they eat.
LEADMALE:Every time you turn around, they eat.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, are those four women us?
LEADFEMALE:Look in the mirror, blubber-butt.
SUPFEMALE:The point I'm trying to make is, what's going on here is living.
SUPFEMALE:Just because you have some rough times doesn't mean you throw in the towel.
SUPMALE:You go on living and eating.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get the cheesecake.
SUPMALE:I'll get the whipped cream.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get the chocolate syrup.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get the Polaroid.
LEADMALE:This is a time to remember.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you don't have a Polaroid.
OTHERMALE:I'll get mine.
LEADFEMALE:It's under my bed.
OTHERFEMALE:I have to go in there for the whipped cream anyway.
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Ma, if you didn't like the dress, you should have just told me.
LEADFEMALE:I was trying to be helpful.
LEADFEMALE:Asking if it came with a sign saying "Wide Load" is not being helpful.
LEADFEMALE:I will never ever take you shopping with me again.
LEADMALE:Fine, I'll shop at the mall by myself.
LEADMALE:Then I'll be able to pee when I'm good and ready.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, you found the dress for the banquet.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, do you just adore it? Does it stir emotions deep within you? Could you just throw yourself down and die for it? It's a dress, Blanche, it's not the Alamo.
LEADMALE:It must be pretty special.
OTHERMALE:It took you five weeks to find it.
LEADFEMALE:That's because I'm hard to fit.
LEADMALE:I can see that, Dorothy, I'm not blind.
LEADMALE:I didn't mean anything by that, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, I tend to fall between sizes myself.
LEADMALE:Usually, I'm smack dab between a four And a 16.
OTHERMALE:Hi, girls.
SUPMALE:Hi, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, is that your dress for the museum fundraiser?
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, let's see it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, all right, but I warn you, it is very simple.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what do you think? I think you're my best friend, so let's change the subject.
SUPMALE:I think it's beautiful.
OTHERFEMALE:Exactly what I would have picked.
LEADMALE:That settles it.
LEADMALE:It goes back tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:What are you wearing, Blanche? I'll probably grab some dazzling little number from my closet, that these people have not been privileged to see.
LEADMALE:Maybe the red, sequined, strapless, backless, low-cut mini.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just tie a scarf around your waist?  Oh, Ma, good news.
LEADMALE:They changed the flavor of Haley's MO.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm taking the dress back.
OTHERMALE:So? So I'm sorry I lost my temper before.
OTHERFEMALE:And Ma, I really would like you to go with me and help me pick out a dress.
LEADMALE:What do you say? What do I say? I'm your mother, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:I was there for you when you needed a communion dress.
SUPFEMALE:I was there when you needed a prom dress.
SUPMALE:I was there when you needed a wedding dress.
OTHERMALE:And frankly, I'm sick of it.
SUPMALE:Buy your own damn dress.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be over at Mildred's.
SUPFEMALE:Rose Nylund? No, if I start acting like her, pull the plug.
LEADMALE:Rose Nylund.
LEADFEMALE:Forty-three years and I'd know you anywhere.
LEADFEMALE:Are you You're not Could you Buddy Rourke.
LEADMALE:Buddy Rourke!
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, Dorothy, it's Buddy Rourke.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on in.
LEADMALE:Buddy, these are my two best friends, Dorothy and Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:How do you do?
LEADFEMALE:Hi, there.
SUPMALE:Buddy Rourke, after all these years.
SUPMALE:You don't know who he is, do you, Rose? Haven't a clue.
SUPFEMALE:Please, don't be embarrassed.
LEADMALE:We never met before.
SUPMALE:Then how exactly would you have known her anywhere? Charlie never stopped talking about her.
LEADMALE:You knew Charlie?
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Please, sit down.
OTHERFEMALE:I served with your husband in the war.
LEADFEMALE:Fort Bragg to Nottingham to Normandy and back, thank the Lord.
OTHERMALE:Charlie Nylund was one of the finest men I ever met.
SUPMALE:I often wonder why he put up with a wise guy like me, from the backstreets of Boston.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry I didn't know who you were, but Charlie didn't talk about the war.
SUPMALE:I always hoped Charlie and I would hook up again one day.
OTHERFEMALE:But, uh, well, believe it or not, I never had the occasion to visit St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf.
SUPFEMALE:Really? You mean, not even to change planes for St.
OTHERMALE:Gustav? Oh, you can't get to St.
OTHERMALE:Gustav by plane, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:You have to go by toboggan.
SUPMALE:Course, traveling in the summer is really rough on the old heinie.
LEADMALE:It's a great way to rack up lots of frequent tobogganer mileage.
LEADMALE:This is just amazing.
LEADFEMALE:How did you ever find Rose after all this time? I got Rose's address from Charlie's army pension records.
LEADFEMALE:And I realized a lifetime had passed and I never laid eyes on my old chum's favorite girl.
LEADFEMALE:So, I made myself a promise.
SUPMALE:If I was ever in the area,
LEADMALE:I'd pay my respects.
OTHERMALE:Would you stay for dinner? I'm making sweet and sour smelt kabobs.
LEADFEMALE:Smelt kabobs.
SUPMALE:Oh, darn, I had them for lunch.
SUPMALE:Me too.
LEADMALE:They served them on the plane.
LEADMALE:And I'm awfully tired after the trip, but I was hoping that, uh, you might let me invite you to lunch tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:That is, if you're free.
LEADMALE:Oh, that'd be wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:And if you have time, I'd like to show you around Miami.
SUPMALE:I'll pick you up around noon.
OTHERFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Ladies, it's been a pleasure meeting you.
LEADMALE:Nice meeting you.
SUPFEMALE:Likewise.
OTHERMALE:Rose, you're every bit as lovely as the picture Charlie used to carry.
SUPMALE:See you tomorrow.
LEADMALE:What a sweet man.
LEADMALE:Absolutely charming.
LEADMALE:And he obviously idolized your Charlie.
SUPFEMALE:And more importantly, he wasn't wearing a wedding ring.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, don't be silly.
LEADFEMALE:I merely checked it out and I noticed him giving me the eye.
SUPMALE:Blanche, have you ever met a man you didn't think was giving you the eye? Once, in 1976.
SUPFEMALE:But it was only two days later that Mr.
LEADFEMALE:President Jimmy Carter announced to the American people he had secretly lusted in his heart.
SUPMALE:You can't be serious.
SUPMALE:Charlie read you every one of my letters? Selected passages.
LEADFEMALE:He selfishly kept the more intimate sections to himself.
LEADFEMALE:One, please.
LEADFEMALE:I used to write him every Sunday, after church.
LEADFEMALE:That way I'd have all the latest gossip around town.
LEADFEMALE:No, he read me the gossip.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, and I remember there was some kind of a scandal.
OTHERMALE:Uh, with a neighbor, I think.
LEADMALE:Uh, the name was, uh, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
SUPMALE:Phineas Wigley? I can't believe you remember that.
SUPFEMALE:Well, in all fairness, Phineas Wigley is a hard name to forget.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I know what you mean.
OTHERMALE:The Wigleys were a revered family.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, until the scandal.
LEADMALE:Oh, it was just terrible.
OTHERFEMALE:The Navy came to town to take bids for a big submarine contract.
LEADFEMALE:They said they wanted three submarines built for a million.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Finneas said he could make 100 for half the money.
LEADFEMALE:So, of course, he got the contract.
OTHERMALE:When the Navy came to check on the progress, six months later, they discovered there'd been a misunderstanding.
LEADMALE:Finneas had made 100 hoagie heroes for $500,000.
SUPFEMALE:He claimed the reason they were so expensive was he used all imported meats and cheeses.
LEADMALE:You know, that story still tickles me.
OTHERMALE:Just as much as the first time Charlie told it to me.
LEADMALE:It just amazes me, how much you know about my life with Charlie.
LEADMALE:Rose I don't think you realize how very much you meant to him.
LEADMALE:Or how very much you meant to me.
LEADFEMALE:To you? I don't understand.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't have a wife or a sweetheart back home.
LEADFEMALE:And when Charlie would read me your letters, I felt like Well, that someone cared.
OTHERMALE:And that meant a lot to me.
SUPFEMALE:I spent a long time searching for someone exactly like Rose Nylund.
SUPFEMALE:I never found her.
SUPFEMALE:And now I know why.
LEADFEMALE:There's no one exactly like Rose Nylund.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Buddy.
OTHERFEMALE:Charlie carried those letters in his jacket through the war.
LEADMALE:I carried them in my heart for a lifetime.
SUPMALE:And I think I fell in love with the woman who wrote them.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, you gonna show me the dress or not?
LEADFEMALE:Be right there.
SUPMALE:Get a move on.
LEADFEMALE:If you hurry up, I can give you an honest unbiased opinion.
OTHERMALE:You'll still have time to return it before the mall closes tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Ma, what do you think?
LEADMALE:Pussycat,
SUPFEMALE:you look sensational.
SUPFEMALE:You really think so, Ma? I really think so.
LEADMALE:I've never seen you look so beautiful.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Ma.
LEADMALE:Who's the designer? He deserves a Nobel Prize for miracles.
LEADMALE:Why do I even ask you? I'm your mother, I'm gonna tell you whether you ask me or not.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, the sleeves are too long.
SUPMALE:I'll ask Rose to shorten them.
OTHERMALE:If you can find her.
LEADFEMALE:Ever since that guy hit town, she spends most of her time polishing his shillaly.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, Rose and Buddy are just friends.
LEADMALE:Sure, and Michael Jackson was born with that cleft in his chin.
OTHERMALE:Girls! Just wait until you see the little number I picked up for the museum banquet.
SUPMALE:Here I come!
SUPMALE:I don't believe it.
LEADMALE:It can't be.
LEADMALE:Don't panic.
LEADFEMALE:Pick up one for Rose, you can go as the Pointer Sisters.
SUPFEMALE:You were going to wear something out of your closet.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I was.
OTHERFEMALE:But as it turned out, nothing fit me.
LEADFEMALE:What did you expect, Blanche? Last weekend, you ate so many pudding pops, you could have built the Eiffel Tower from the sticks.
SUPFEMALE:That is not what I meant.
LEADMALE:I meant everything just hangs on me.
LEADFEMALE:Of course.
LEADFEMALE:That's why you have to cover it with a dress.
SUPMALE:All right, Dorothy, what are we gonna do about this? We are not going to do anything.
SUPMALE:Blanche, it has taken me a whole month to find this dress, you are simply going to have to take yours back.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, be reasonable.
LEADFEMALE:This dress looks so much better on me than it does on you.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, girls.
SUPFEMALE:I love your dress.
LEADFEMALE:I am not taking mine back.
SUPFEMALE:I am not taking mine back.
SUPMALE:Girls, I really need to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:This is crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Since when do you care how you look? I think it started when I came down from the bell tower and had my hump fixed.
LEADMALE:Buddy's going back to Boston on Saturday.
SUPFEMALE:This dress looks sensational on me.
SUPMALE:People expect to see me in a sensational dress.
LEADMALE:What do they expect to see me in, a yarmulke and a Hefty bag? He wants me to go with him.
LEADMALE:To live with him.
LEADMALE:And I think I might.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, honey, you can't be serious.
LEADMALE:Why not?
LEADFEMALE:You hardly know the man.
SUPFEMALE:I feel like I've known him all my life.
SUPMALE:I talk to him about Charlie, I talk to him about St.
LEADMALE:Olaf, I talk to him about my family, my animal friends, I talk to him about life on the farm If that man didn't get a medal in the war, he deserves one now.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute! Did she just say "live with him"? That's right, Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:Not marry him, live with him.
OTHERMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Two World Wars, a Polish pope and now this.
LEADFEMALE:I may live to see CBS come up with a morning show yet.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:Well, frankly, Rose, I think you're just rushing things.
LEADFEMALE:But, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it's better to live with Buddy than to just charge full steam ahead and marry him.
LEADFEMALE:No, it isn't.
LEADMALE:This is morally wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:It is epically offensive.
LEADMALE:It's an out and out sin.
LEADFEMALE:Why do I feel like I just fell through the looking glass? Blanche, how can you, of all people, say something like that? Well, Rose Nylund, I have never lived with a man without the benefit of marriage.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, Blanche, I think what you mean is you have never lived with a man without benefit of room service.
LEADMALE:Being with a man is not the same thing as living with a man.
LEADFEMALE:You're right, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Living with a man eliminates the need for an overnight bag and a stop at the drugstore.
SUPMALE:And the need for marriage.
OTHERMALE:Family and tradition.
OTHERMALE:Not to mention wedding showers, catered affairs, the bridal registry at Burdines.
SUPMALE:Well, I know what you mean, Blanche, but there's another side to this.
LEADMALE:If I had lived with Stan before we got married I could have spared us both some very painful times.
LEADMALE:And a bitter divorce.
SUPFEMALE:And possibly given birth to reasonably attractive children.
LEADFEMALE:It does seem like the right thing to do.
SUPFEMALE:I'm comfortable with Buddy.
LEADMALE:Everything seems so natural.
LEADMALE:It's easier being with him because he already knows
LEADFEMALE:so much about me.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but Rose,
OTHERMALE:do you love him?
SUPMALE:I think so.
OTHERMALE:What about money?
OTHERFEMALE:Everyone loves money.
SUPMALE:Oh, I mean, have you talked about financial arrangements? If you were married, you could have a prenuptial agreement.
SUPMALE:But just living together, all you can do is steal money out of his wallet while he's in the shower.
SUPFEMALE:We've agreed to keep our finances separate.
OTHERFEMALE:He insisted on it.
OTHERMALE:That's good, at least.
LEADMALE:He suggested that since we'll need a bigger place to live, I should give him my half of the money now before I get there.
LEADMALE:So that it'll be our place, not his, right from the start.
LEADMALE:Sounds like you've made up your mind.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I have.
LEADMALE:Oh, but I feel awful about leaving you guys.
LEADMALE:I feel like I'm breaking up the Three Musketeers.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you go with your heart.
LEADFEMALE:We just want you to be happy.
SUPFEMALE:I am happy.
LEADFEMALE:And I want you to be happy.
LEADMALE:That's why I want you to settle this dress business.
OTHERMALE:Oh! There is nothing to settle.
LEADMALE:Now, I am wearing this dress.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy! It deserves to be displayed on a devastatingly beautiful body.
OTHERMALE:Who are you gonna send it to, Kim Basinger? What is that supposed to mean? Why don't you think about it while inhaling your next cheese cake.
LEADFEMALE:How dare she imply that I overeat.
LEADMALE:Makes me so mad! Oh, darn.
LEADMALE:We're out of Chips Ahoy.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna get out of this girdle and go down to the market for some cookies and bean dip.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hell, I'll just take the damn thing off in the car.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, I'm glad you're here.
LEADMALE:I have something to tell you.
LEADFEMALE:What are you holding?
LEADFEMALE:A new gown.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no! I wanted to be the nice one.
OTHERMALE:I bought a new dress too.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Marty's? On Market Street? Where every dress is a guaranteed one of a kind original? If we have the same dress, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Marty's gonna be left with one of a kind.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank goodness! Everything's all right.
OTHERMALE:Except for what I have to tell you.
LEADMALE:It wasn't about the dress? It was about Rose and Buddy.
LEADFEMALE:That business of giving him money has been bothering me.
OTHERFEMALE:So I've decided to do some checking on Buddy Rourke.
LEADMALE:And after a couple of phone calls I found out he had just retired after 45 years in the records department of the Army Pension Office.
LEADMALE:I don't get it.
LEADFEMALE:That's how he knew about Charlie.
LEADFEMALE:They never served together.
SUPFEMALE:He just read his file.
SUPMALE:But he knew all those things about Rose.
LEADMALE:He knew that she came from St.
OTHERMALE:Olaf.
LEADMALE:I mean, everything else, Rose probably volunteered.
OTHERMALE:You know her, a stranger says hello, and suddenly he's hearing the life story of Uncle Fingerbinger and his 30-pound rutabaga.
LEADMALE:Then this is all just a scam to bilk Rose out of some money? Absolutely, and it is not the first time he's tried it.
LEADFEMALE:Where is Rose? I mean, we have to tell her.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, she said she had to go to the bank and then go to meet Buddy.
LEADFEMALE:What are we gonna do? There's nothing we can do.
SUPFEMALE:Wait until she gets home.
SUPMALE:Oh, good Lord.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, girls.
LEADMALE:How do you like this spiffy little number I picked up? Sophia, that's the same dress I got.
LEADMALE:Well, now you know how it should look.
SUPFEMALE:I wrote the kids about you.
SUPFEMALE:Really?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, not about us.
SUPFEMALE:About you.
LEADMALE:About how you knew their father.
LEADFEMALE:They found it unbelievable.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? Well, that you and I finally met.
LEADMALE:Oh, I thought you meant they wouldn't believe there were any dinosaurs still around
LEADMALE:from World War II.
OTHERFEMALE:Speaking of dinosaurs, did Charlie ever tell you about how they found the dinosaur bones right outside St.
SUPMALE:Olaf?
SUPMALE:Rose
LEADFEMALE:Karl Nickerson was teaching his German shepherd to bury a herring bone.
OTHERMALE:Karl was
SUPMALE:Rose! You haven't even mentioned about moving to Boston.
LEADFEMALE:Are you avoiding the subject?
LEADMALE:I can't go with you, Buddy.
SUPMALE:But, Rose It wouldn't be fair.
LEADMALE:I've given it a lot of thought and I realize, I'm not being honest with you.
LEADMALE:Or with myself.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, how could this be?
SUPFEMALE:We've been so happy.
LEADMALE:Oh, I am happy.
LEADFEMALE:Happy with the memories of Charlie that you rekindled.
LEADMALE:Oh! Sometimes I put those memories too far away because I'm afraid they'll be painful.
LEADFEMALE:It's the hardest on holidays or when I'm lying in bed, alone at night.
OTHERMALE:But remembering Charlie with you is wonderful.
SUPMALE:I'm glad I met you, Buddy.
OTHERFEMALE:But I don't love you.
LEADMALE:I I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Listen, I went to the bank and I got something for you.
LEADFEMALE:It's a gold watch.
OTHERFEMALE:It's Charlie's gold watch.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to have it.
LEADMALE:But this is a very expensive piece of jewelry.
LEADFEMALE:Please, Buddy.
LEADMALE:I think I've taken enough from you and Charlie already.
LEADFEMALE:What?
SUPMALE:Listen, I hate emotional scenes.
LEADMALE:I'm the only Irishman in Boston who avoids wakes and political rallies.
LEADMALE:So, I'm just gonna run, you understand?
SUPMALE:But Buddy
SUPMALE:I'll write.
SUPFEMALE:I will.
OTHERMALE:No, I won't.
LEADMALE:I always say that.
LEADMALE:I never do.
LEADFEMALE:You take care of yourself, Rose.
LEADMALE:You're a special lady.
SUPFEMALE: Ma?
LEADMALE:Ma, I need to talk to someone.
SUPFEMALE:Sure, come in.
SUPMALE:I can hear Pavarotti live from the Met anytime.
OTHERMALE:What's the problem? Ma, I'm upset about Rose.
OTHERMALE:Me too.
SUPMALE:I thought I was finally gonna get a room with some sunlight.
SUPMALE:I'm upset because we haven't told her the truth about Buddy.
LEADMALE:Everything turned out all right.
SUPMALE:She gave him the brush off, she didn't give him any money,
LEADFEMALE:he didn't even take the watch.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:But we're letting her live with a lie.
LEADFEMALE:So, a little lie gave her a lot of pleasure.
SUPMALE:What harm does that do?
OTHERMALE:Oh, I don't know.
SUPMALE:Then what's the problem?
LEADFEMALE:It doesn't seem right.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, let me tell you a story.
SUPFEMALE:Picture it.
LEADMALE:Sicily, 1922.
LEADFEMALE:A young military officer stationed far from home.
LEADMALE:He wanders the streets seeking a friendly face and a glass of Chianti.
LEADFEMALE:Finally, he happens into a dusty little cafe where he finds both.
LEADFEMALE:The man laughs for the first time in months.
SUPFEMALE:And finds inspiration in a beautiful peasant girl, wise beyond her years.
SUPMALE:When the cafe is closed, she takes him home with her.
SUPFEMALE:Three glorious days, they make love and drink wine.
SUPMALE:He returns to his command prepared to lead his people through whatever battles need to be fought.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, that young peasant girl was me.
SUPMALE:And that young man was Winston Churchill.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, you made that whole thing up, now what is your point? That I made it up.
LEADFEMALE:It was a little lie that gave me a lot of pleasure.
SUPFEMALE:If Rose is happy, and there was no harm done, let her have that.
OTHERMALE:You know something, Ma You may be right.
OTHERMALE:Good night, Charlie.
LEADMALE:I love you.
OTHERFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Well, hi, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:How was bingo? Judge for yourself.
LEADMALE:Ma, you don't have any clothes on.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me about it.
LEADMALE:I just walked ten blocks.
LEADFEMALE:I got a belly button full of tweed.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, what the hell happened? In the middle of bingo, Murray Hazeltine sits down.
LEADFEMALE:He's the big practical joker at the center.
OTHERMALE:Believe me, Howie Mandel is funnier.
LEADMALE:Anyway, he tells me to sniff his carnation for good luck.
LEADFEMALE:I take one whiff, and bingo.
LEADFEMALE:He squirted your dress with ink.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, it was Del Monte prune juice.
LEADFEMALE:It's free at the center.
LEADMALE:It's a come-on.
LEADFEMALE:They make their real money on the powdered toilet seat rentals.
SUPMALE:What happened to your clothes? Murray took them to have them cleaned.
LEADFEMALE:I still can't believe it happened.
SUPMALE:I've never been so humiliated.
LEADFEMALE:There's no reason for you to be embarrassed.
OTHERMALE:He plays tricks on everybody.
SUPMALE:I'm talking about on my way home.
LEADFEMALE:My belt came loose in front of a construction site.
LEADMALE:Nobody whistled, and two guys went home sick.
SUPMALE:Hi, girls.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, what are you doing with that heavy coat on inside the house?
LEADFEMALE:You tell me, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Ma! Dorothy, was Sophia naked just now, or does her dress really need ironing? Hello, girls.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, Rose, you remember Laszlo.
LEADMALE:Of course.
SUPFEMALE:Laszlo, the artist from your museum.
LEADMALE:Oh, we really enjoyed your lecture on modern sculpture.
LEADMALE:I didn't think anyone was paying attention.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, we sure were.
LEADFEMALE:Especially Dorothy.
LEADMALE:She talked about taking up sculpting.
LEADMALE:Really?
LEADMALE:Oh, no, I didn't.
SUPMALE:Yes, you did.
LEADMALE:You said you'd like to help him mold his clay or buff his marble anytime.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, you're such a kidder.
LEADMALE:Won't you sit down.
LEADMALE:He is gorgeous, isn't he, girls? There's not a woman at the museum who hasn't been after him.
LEADFEMALE:Women can be so silly.
SUPFEMALE:They think because you're an artist, you must be a great lover.
LEADFEMALE:Because you're a master in the studio, you must be a master in the bedroom.
LEADMALE:They think because you can work a piece of clay into a piece of beautiful art, you can also work a woman's body into fits of ecstasy and passion and total screaming abandon.
LEADFEMALE:Would anybody else like something cold to drink?
LEADFEMALE:I would.
OTHERMALE:I would.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I really should be going.
OTHERMALE:Thank you again for the ride home.
SUPFEMALE:It was my pleasure.
LEADFEMALE:Good-bye, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Good-bye, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Good-bye, Rose.
LEADMALE:Good-bye, Blanche again.
SUPFEMALE:It was my pleasure, ladies.
OTHERFEMALE:Good-bye.
LEADMALE:Laszlo, I'll see you tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Indeed.
LEADFEMALE:That sure sounded as if you and Laszlo have something going.
SUPMALE:Maybe.
LEADFEMALE:You're not telling us? All right.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:You twisted my arm.
SUPFEMALE:Girls, Laszlo's asked me to pose for one of his sculptures.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm not.
LEADFEMALE:Look here.
OTHERFEMALE:He gave me the key to his building.
SUPFEMALE:I have my first session tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Wow! He's always wanted to do a piece on the mature woman, and he thinks I'm perfect for it.
LEADFEMALE:And the best part is, he's gonna have it displayed at his big show.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe you're actually going through with this.
SUPMALE:Of course I am, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Laszlo is a world-famous sculptor.
LEADMALE:This is my opportunity to be immortalized forever in a classic work of art.
LEADFEMALE:That's what she said when that shoe salesman took Polaroids of her in the backseat of his Volare.
OTHERFEMALE:Good morning, Ma.
SUPMALE:Good morning.
LEADMALE:I poured you a glass of orange juice.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:It was very nice of you.
LEADFEMALE:Ma! Is this a dribble glass? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:It works better when all that pulp doesn't clog up the dribble hole.
SUPFEMALE:Why did you do this? Murray Hazeltine.
LEADMALE:He won't quit with the practical jokes.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna give him a taste of his own medicine.
SUPFEMALE:Do I look like Murray Hazeltine? A little around the eyebrows.
LEADMALE:But that's not the point.
SUPFEMALE:I've got to have the perfect gag before I spring it on him.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, I'm sorry, pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:No hard feelings? Oh, okay, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:No hard feelings.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Ah! You know, I could really get tired of this.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, you're a mess.
LEADFEMALE:I just spilled orange juice on myself.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really? I didn't notice that.
LEADMALE:Pour Blanche some orange juice, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:I could use that.
SUPFEMALE:I might be coming down with a cold.
LEADMALE:Doesn't come as a surprise.
LEADMALE:You've spent every afternoon this week standing stark naked in a cold, windy studio.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I didn't catch cold at Laszlo's studio, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Laszlo keeps me too warm for that.
LEADMALE:Too warm and too tingly.
LEADFEMALE:Too warm and too tingly and too hot.
OTHERMALE:Well, have some juice anyway, Blanche.
SUPMALE:I'd feel better.
OTHERMALE:Not that we actually do anything.
LEADFEMALE:In the studio.
LEADMALE:Laszlo's been a perfect gentleman so far.
LEADMALE:I just stand there in front of him in all my luscious nakedness, and somehow he manages to suppress the urge to throw me on the floor and ravage me.
LEADMALE:If he throws you on the floor, you'll both end up in the apartment below.
SUPFEMALE:Drink up, Blanche.
LEADMALE:That must be him now.
LEADMALE:I just have to get my jacket.
SUPMALE:We're driving to the museum together.
OTHERMALE:Coming, Laszlo.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Laszlo.
LEADMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:Blanche went to get her jacket.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:We are so excited about what you two are doing.
LEADMALE:It's gonna turn out great.
LEADMALE:I wish I was so sure.
LEADMALE:What do you mean?
SUPFEMALE:I'm having second thoughts.
LEADMALE:About what? When I met Blanche, I thought she would be the perfect model.
SUPMALE:You know, sexy, sassy, exciting.
LEADFEMALE:But now I'm thinking there are other qualities I wish to capture.
SUPMALE:Like what?
LEADFEMALE:Innocence.
SUPFEMALE:Wholesomeness.
OTHERFEMALE:Naiveté.
SUPFEMALE:I see a woman with a fuller figure, wider hips, wider eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:Laszlo.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, I have to ask you something.
OTHERFEMALE:I know what it is.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna ask me to pose for you.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm not.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I'm so embarrassed.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:That's exactly the quality I want to capture.
LEADMALE:Oh, take my key, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:Come to my studio.
LEADFEMALE:We will make a beautiful sculpture.
OTHERFEMALE:What about Blanche?
LEADFEMALE:I will still see her.
SUPFEMALE:She doesn't have to know about you.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow morning at 10:00?
SUPMALE:That seems so dishonest.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche is a dear friend.
LEADMALE:It would be a betrayal.
LEADMALE:Here I am, Laszlo.
LEADMALE:Did Rose keep you entertained? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:I find her charming.
SUPMALE:Oh, Laszlo.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I love about you.
LEADFEMALE:You can tell a bald-faced lie and still sound sincere.
LEADMALE:I forgot my compact.
OTHERMALE:I'll be back.
SUPFEMALE:Give me that key.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, I'm glad you're home.
SUPFEMALE:I was upstairs poking around the attic.
OTHERMALE:Look what I found.
LEADFEMALE:Your grandmother's antique kaleidoscope.
SUPMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:Take a look.
LEADMALE:Ma, you must really think I'm stupid.
LEADMALE:What, we don't have an attic? I am not falling for this.
SUPMALE:It's another one of your practical jokes.
OTHERFEMALE:If I look through that, I'll get charcoal around my eye.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Why don't we call a truce with a nice piece of peanut brittle? Come on, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:The peanut brittle is an even older gag than the kaleidoscope.
OTHERMALE:I'll open the can, snakes will come out.
LEADMALE:I am too smart for you.
LEADMALE:I am not falling for more of your practical jokes.
LEADMALE:Except for this whoopee cushion.
SUPFEMALE:You will not believe what happened to me today.
LEADMALE:I still do not believe it, and you won't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:What, Blanche?
OTHERFEMALE:I don't wanna talk about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I am so mad.
SUPMALE:Blanche, I can explain.
LEADMALE:It's got nothing to do with you.
LEADFEMALE:It's Laszlo.
SUPFEMALE:I saw some of the sketches he's been doing of me.
SUPMALE:He never lets me see them.
OTHERFEMALE:So today I found some.
LEADFEMALE:They're horrible.
LEADFEMALE:My hair's all big and frizzy.
LEADFEMALE:The body's all droopy and saggy.
SUPFEMALE:The woman in those sketches is a dog.
LEADMALE:Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:She's a clown.
SUPMALE:Blanche.
OTHERMALE:She's just a hideous, wrinkled, old bag.
SUPMALE:Blanche, the woman in those sketches is me.
LEADMALE:I know she sounds like you, honey, but she's not.
LEADMALE:Yes, she is.
LEADMALE:Look.
OTHERMALE:I wanted to tell you about this all week, but I couldn't.
SUPFEMALE:I've been posing for Laszlo, too.
LEADFEMALE:Dear Lord, strike me dead right here and now if that man prefers Rose Nylund over me.
LEADMALE:Blanche, you can't take it personally.
LEADMALE:Laszlo just decided he wanted someone with more innocence.
LEADFEMALE:With more cellulite is more like it.
LEADMALE:Take that back.
OTHERFEMALE:I will not.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, you will.
LEADFEMALE:I will not.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, what is going on here?
LEADFEMALE:Rose stabbing me in the back.
SUPMALE:I did not.
LEADMALE:She's been posing for Laszlo.
LEADFEMALE:He asked me to.
LEADMALE:I don't know why.
OTHERFEMALE:He can go to Sea World to see a naked whale.
SUPFEMALE:Or to your bathtub.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that does it, missy.
LEADFEMALE:All right, this means war.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll both keep going.
SUPFEMALE:We'll see who he picks.
LEADMALE:It's gonna be me.
OTHERFEMALE:It's gonna be me.
SUPMALE:Girls, I can settle this.
LEADFEMALE:Tell her who it's gonna be.
LEADFEMALE:It's going to be me.
SUPMALE:You, too? He asked me last Thursday.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I am stunned.
SUPFEMALE:I'm relieved.
SUPFEMALE:Relieved? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:The woman you saw in those horrible drawings must have been Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:This has got to be one of the worst days in my life.
LEADMALE:Two of my best friends just stabbed me in the back.
LEADFEMALE:Did you really expect us to turn Laszlo down? You said yourself it was a chance to become "immortalized in a classic work of art.
LEADMALE:" Horse pucky.
LEADMALE:You went for the same reason Rose 
LEADFEMALE:To get your hands on my man.
LEADFEMALE:What exactly makes you think he's your man?
LEADMALE:Who?
SUPFEMALE:Maybe that I found him first.
LEADMALE:Who?
LEADFEMALE:He dumped you for me.
OTHERMALE:Who?
LEADMALE:Laszlo, Ma.
LEADMALE:Who's Laszlo? A Hungarian artist we've all been posing nude for.
LEADMALE:In the future, a simple "none of your business, Sophia" will suffice.
LEADMALE:Tell me honestly, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Do you have reason to believe Laszlo might be interested in you? Well, just the fact that on numerous occasions he has referred to me as his "greatest artistic inspiration ever, bar none.
SUPMALE:"
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, let's face it, girls.
LEADFEMALE:We have no idea which one of us Laszlo wants to use.
OTHERMALE:I think it's obvious, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:The man is an artist.
LEADMALE:He has taste.
SUPFEMALE:He cannot help but pick the woman with the most grace, style, femininity  I wonder if he knows which one of us he wants.
LEADMALE:He told me that I had something that Blanche didn't have.
OTHERFEMALE:He probably told Dorothy she had something that I don't.
SUPMALE:Maybe he's back to Blanche.
OTHERMALE:I think he's been very unfair.
LEADMALE:We ought to stop going.
LEADMALE:Then he'd have no sculpture.
LEADFEMALE:It would serve him right.
OTHERMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Let's make a pact.
SUPFEMALE:None of us will go back.
SUPMALE:We'll seal it by you giving me your keys, and I'll keep all three of them safe in my hope chest.
SUPMALE:How do we know that you and your hope chest won't keep going? There's only one thing to do.
SUPFEMALE:Go to Laszlo and make him decide who he wants.
OTHERMALE:Fine with me.
SUPFEMALE:Fine with me, too.
LEADMALE:Then let's go.
SUPMALE:Where's everybody going?
LEADMALE:We'll be back.
SUPMALE:Ma, why don't you sit right over here and read your magazine, okay? Oh.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Don't try to outsmart me, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:I got the mind of a fox and the butt muscles of Baryshnikov.
SUPFEMALE:Coming.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:Come in.
OTHERMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:You've brought your friends to see my studio.
LEADMALE:What a pleasant surprise.
SUPFEMALE:Laszlo, we all know.
LEADFEMALE:We figured it all out this afternoon.
OTHERMALE:So, I am caught at last.
LEADMALE:What can I say? "Blanche and Rose, get out.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, it's you I want.
SUPMALE:" Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I've never seen him in overalls before.
SUPFEMALE:Laszlo, we came over for you to decide which one of us you want for your statue.
SUPFEMALE:Rose I knew it.
LEADFEMALE:It's me.
LEADFEMALE:Walk, suckers.
OTHERMALE:He wants me.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, he just wanted to say something to you.
SUPFEMALE:I wanted to say that I would rather not decide at all.
LEADMALE:But, Laszlo, you've got to.
LEADFEMALE:It's the only way.
LEADFEMALE:Otherwise, it'll just end up coming between the three of us.
LEADMALE:Which one of us is it gonna be? Dorothy here, or Rose, or a woman whose breasts you once described as "perfect champagne glass-sized orbs of dancing loveliness"? Blanche, I did not say that.
LEADMALE:Well, you agreed when I said it.
OTHERMALE:Ladies, let me explain.
OTHERFEMALE:I know I should have made my choice long ago, but you each inspired me so well.
SUPFEMALE:I wish I could continue seeing you all, but I understand why that is unacceptable.
LEADMALE:Therefore, my choice will have to be Before you make your choice, let me say what a privilege it has been to work with a man I consider to be the greatest Hungarian sculptor of our time.
LEADFEMALE:And let me say if Blanche can name two other Hungarian sculptors of any time, I shall eat that statue.
SUPMALE:What's it gonna be? Who do you choose?
SUPMALE:None of you.
OTHERFEMALE:None of us? I have enough sketches of each of you to make my sculpture.
SUPMALE:When I'm ready to begin, I will make my choice then.
SUPMALE:When we will find out? Only when the work is unveiled at my show.
LEADMALE:Now, I apologize, but this is how I must work.
LEADFEMALE:Now, ladies, I must bid you good day.
LEADMALE:Laszlo, just one more thing.
OTHERFEMALE:You know that famous Picasso painting, "Nude Woman Playing the Violin"?
SUPMALE:But of course.
LEADMALE:Originally it was called "Blanche Playing the Violin.
LEADFEMALE:" Only it wasn't a violin.
OTHERMALE:Think about that the next time you're standing around with your chisel in your hand.
SUPMALE:Oh! Oh, my God, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:There it is.
LEADFEMALE:The statue.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this is so exciting.
SUPMALE:I can't wait to hear that crowd gasp when they lift up the sheet and see me there.
SUPFEMALE:I'd think you'd be used to that by now, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Hi, girls.
SUPMALE:Some party, isn't it? What are you so cheerful about? Why shouldn't I be? For starters, any minute now, this entire room could be looking at a statue of your nude body.
LEADMALE:Nude? The statue's gonna be nude? What did you think? He'd put it in a rain poncho? Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:Hey, Dorothy, can you believe it? Ten grand for this piece of junk.
LEADMALE:Oh! Oh, Ma! You fell for it.
LEADFEMALE:This stuff kills me.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, ma'am.
LEADFEMALE:You'll have to come with me.
OTHERMALE:You just smashed a priceless Lichtenfein.
LEADFEMALE:I must have mixed the two up.
SUPMALE:When are you gonna learn that you have to stop with these ridiculous practical jokes? I can't believe it.
SUPMALE:She fell for it again.
LEADFEMALE:You ought to have "yutz" tattooed on your forehead.
LEADFEMALE:Here you go.
SUPMALE:You were brilliant, Harry.
LEADMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? This is the moment we've all been waiting for.
SUPFEMALE:The unveiling of the latest masterpiece of Mr.
SUPMALE:Laszlo Gregorian.
SUPMALE:So without further ado, off with the sheet.
LEADMALE:Oh! Oh! My God, I look gorgeous.
LEADMALE:You? Blanche, that's me.
SUPFEMALE:The hell it is.
OTHERMALE:Girls, be serious.
LEADMALE:Look at those eyes.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at the nose.
LEADMALE:Look at the butt.
LEADFEMALE:You can't see the butt.
SUPMALE:Then it sure can't be you.
LEADMALE:You.
LEADFEMALE:This is ridiculous.
SUPMALE:There's only one way to settle this.
LEADMALE:Where is Laszlo?
SUPMALE:There he is.
SUPMALE:Laszlo.
SUPFEMALE:Let me be the first to tell you what a simply stunning piece of art this is.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Who the hell is it? It's not obvious?
SUPFEMALE:Not to them.
SUPFEMALE:Not to them.
OTHERFEMALE:I see I must explain.
LEADFEMALE:In this statue, I want a look of strength and character.
LEADFEMALE:So I chose Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:I knew it.
SUPFEMALE:Then I dropped her.
SUPMALE:Like so many before you.
LEADFEMALE:I decided I needed more sensuality and vitality.
LEADMALE:So I turned to my sketches of Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it.
LEADFEMALE:Then I put them away.
SUPFEMALE:I wanted more softness, more sweetness.
LEADMALE:So I went to my sketches of Rose.
LEADMALE:You mean that's me up there?
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Then who is it?
LEADMALE:It is all of you.
OTHERFEMALE:The answer finally came to me.
LEADFEMALE:Why not take the best features of each lady to create one perfect lady? That is what you see.
LEADFEMALE:It is not hard to understand why you are such good friends.
LEADMALE:You complement each other very well indeed.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! Thank you, Laszlo.
LEADMALE:One more thing, Laszlo.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to ask you a question.
LEADFEMALE:By any chance, is there anybody here tonight in whom you might be interested romantically? Well, as a matter of fact, yes.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it! It's me! Oh, Laszlo.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like we're a hit.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I thought you knew.
SUPMALE:How can you blame him? The man looked at the three of you naked for a month.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, Ma.
OTHERMALE:You'll be glad to know my practical joking days are over.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, that is wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:So sit down and have a glass of juice.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I will.
LEADMALE:You wouldn't be playing a joke with this glass, would you?
LEADMALE:Of course not.
LEADMALE:Of course not.
LEADFEMALE:Because I know how much fun you have playing practical jokes.
SUPFEMALE:I told you it's over.
LEADFEMALE:Drink your juice.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Ma, I will.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, did you leave something burning on the stove? What? I don't think so.
LEADMALE:It was nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Well, bottoms up.
LEADMALE:Don't ever change, pussycat.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Oh, boy.
LEADFEMALE:What a day.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? Butch and Sundance steal your seat on the bus? I had a miserable day.
LEADFEMALE:That manager docked me a half day's pay because I said hello to the customers.
SUPMALE:You're not allowed to say hello? Not at Pecos Pete's Chow Wagon.
LEADFEMALE:You have to say howdy.
LEADFEMALE:As a matter of fact, you say, "Howdy, partner? How about a saddlebag of fries with that ranch house burger?" I don't know why it doesn't trip naturally off my tongue.
SUPMALE:Sophia, they took half your day's pay just for that? This manager is a shark.
LEADFEMALE:He's buckin' for supervisor.
LEADFEMALE:He told Mildred and Edna they could only take ten-minute bathroom breaks.
SUPMALE:Well, Ma, that's not unreasonable.
LEADFEMALE:Please! They're 85.
SUPFEMALE:It takes Mildred ten minutes to roll down her stockings.
SUPMALE:You'll never guess what I got in the mail.
SUPMALE:If it's one of those adult toys from the back of a sleazy magazine, I'm not interested.
LEADFEMALE:I am.
LEADMALE:Let me see it.
LEADMALE:Ma! You wait your turn.
LEADMALE:It's a postcard from my daughter, Rebecca.
SUPFEMALE:Girls, can you believe it? After almost four years, my baby's comin' to see me.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm so happy I could cry.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, you are crying.
LEADMALE:Admit it, Rose.
SUPMALE:You worked for Allied Intelligence during World War II.
LEADFEMALE:Huh?
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Play it cagey.
SUPFEMALE:When is she coming, Blanche? She says in two weeks.
LEADFEMALE:Look.
SUPFEMALE:She signs it "Love, Rebecca.
SUPMALE:" I guess that means she's forgiven me.
LEADMALE:Forgiven you for what?
LEADMALE:It's difficult to talk about.
OTHERMALE:She wanted to leave school to become a fashion model.
LEADFEMALE:You're daughter's a fashion model? She's just beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Always has been.
LEADMALE:Gorgeous blonde hair, sparklin' blue eyes, a figure men would mortgage a house for.
SUPFEMALE:We were always so much alike.
LEADFEMALE:And so close, just like Siamese twins.
LEADFEMALE:It's a shame when they separated you, you got both butts.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Anyway, we had a terrible fight about her quittin' school.
LEADFEMALE:She told me to stay out of her life.
LEADMALE:She swore she would never speak to me and hasn't.
LEADMALE:That sounds like it's in the past.
SUPFEMALE:I hope so.
SUPMALE:I have missed her.
LEADFEMALE:She's always been my favorite.
LEADFEMALE:It sure makes me appreciate the special relationship I have with my daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Pussycat?
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Ma? Dial your sister.
LEADMALE:I never remember the area code.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:6:00 at Mildred's.
LEADMALE:We're putting together a list of demands to present to that scuzzball, McCracken.
LEADMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:Oh, and, Edna, bring some sherry.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody bought that glaucoma story when you whipped out that reefer last time.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, you can't put it in brownies.
LEADMALE:I said no reefers.
LEADMALE:Okay? Good-bye.
LEADFEMALE:The problems you're having remind me of something that happened in St.
OTHERFEMALE:Olaf.
SUPFEMALE:Dust reminds you of something in St.
SUPFEMALE:Olaf.
LEADMALE:I got work to do.
SUPMALE:I moved your things into my room.
LEADMALE:Why did you do that? Blanche's daughter.
LEADMALE:You're gonna have to sleep with me.
LEADFEMALE:Let me respond to that the way your dates do.
OTHERFEMALE:"No, thanks.
SUPMALE:I'll call you sometime.
LEADMALE:"
LEADFEMALE:Okay, girls, how do I look?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, you look beautiful.
SUPMALE:But do I look like a mother? Are you kidding? From the side, you look like you're about to drop twins.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, relax, honey.
SUPMALE:You look lovely.
LEADMALE:I'm so nervous about seeing Becky after such a long time.
LEADFEMALE:I want everything to be perfect.
OTHERMALE:It will be.
LEADMALE:I don't know what to say to her.
LEADFEMALE:Johnny Carson had that same problem the other night with F.
LEADFEMALE:Murray Abraham.
SUPMALE:Good Lord, that's her.
SUPMALE:My beautiful baby girl.
LEADMALE:Oh, gosh.
LEADMALE:I can't do this.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not ready.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, come back.
SUPFEMALE:I need more time.
OTHERMALE:It's been four years.
SUPMALE:I need five more minutes.
OTHERFEMALE:I need four years and five minutes.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:All right, all right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm coming.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:You're Blanche's daughter, the model? What did she model, car covers? You'll have to forgive my mother.
LEADMALE:It's just that we didn't expect you to be this fat.
SUPMALE:Becky, it's a pleasure meeting you.
OTHERMALE:I'm Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:This is Rose.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:This is my mother, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Nice to meet y'all.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, what brings you to Miami? My guess is, a small barge.
LEADMALE:Why don't you see what's keeping Blanche? Mama.
SUPMALE:Rebecca.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! Honey.
LEADFEMALE:Honey.
LEADFEMALE:Let me get a look at you.
SUPFEMALE:This could take several hours.
LEADMALE:Darlin', I have missed you so much.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I missed you, too, Mama.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe we should leave them alone.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you leave, girls.
LEADMALE:I want my friends to share my happiness.
LEADMALE:My enormous happiness.
LEADMALE:Tell me all about Paris.
SUPMALE:Where'd you live? Where'd you work? Where'd you find jeans that size?
LEADFEMALE:Sophia.
OTHERFEMALE:That's okay.
LEADFEMALE:I may have lost my figure, but I still have my sense of humor.
LEADFEMALE:Does it bother you that I gained weight? I'm just so glad to have you back again.
SUPFEMALE:I'll show you where you'll be stayin' so we can unpack.
SUPMALE:Now I understand why she's sleeping in Blanche's bed.
LEADMALE:It supports the weight of an average female and two Venezuelan soccer players.
OTHERMALE:Here we are.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I love your home, Mama.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Well, honey, tell me.
LEADFEMALE:How's your modeling career been goin'? Well, to be honest, Mama, not too well lately.
LEADFEMALE:What have you been doin'?
LEADMALE:You mean besides eatin'?
LEADMALE:I didn't say that.
SUPFEMALE:That's what you meant.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you have filled out a little bit.
LEADMALE:But I don't want you to be upset, Becky.
LEADFEMALE:We can fix it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna put you on a diet.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want help.
SUPFEMALE:I'm happy the way I am.
LEADFEMALE:Happy? Look at yourself.
LEADMALE:How could you be happy? You're not happy, Mama.
OTHERMALE:You're doin' it again.
OTHERMALE:You're tellin' me how to live.
SUPMALE:What do you mean?
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing's ever enough for you.
LEADFEMALE:I had to be the prettiest.
LEADFEMALE:I had to be the most popular.
LEADFEMALE:I had to be the brightest.
LEADFEMALE:That didn't mean you had to run out and become the fattest.
SUPFEMALE:Mama, you have to accept me for what I am.
LEADFEMALE:You have to stop tryin' to run my life, otherwise I'm gonna have to leave again.
LEADFEMALE:Now, honey Oh, you know, you're absolutely right.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, I love you just the way you are.
LEADMALE:Every last pound of you.
SUPFEMALE:Just exactly how many pounds is it I'm currently lovin'?
LEADFEMALE:Mama!
LEADFEMALE:Never mind.
LEADMALE:Hi, Sophia.
LEADMALE:How was your meeting? Terrible.
OTHERFEMALE:That weasel of a manager wouldn't budge an inch.
LEADMALE:He pushed us to the wall.
LEADMALE:Now it's war.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? Tomorrow morning, all Chow Wagon employees over the age of 70 are officially out on strike.
LEADMALE:You're gonna picket the restaurant?
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna put on war paint and shoot flaming arrows at the covered wagon out front.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, that might even get you on the 6:00 news.
LEADFEMALE:The table on the lanai's set.
LEADFEMALE:Rebecca should be here with Jeremy.
LEADMALE:Did Rebecca bring Jeremy to Miami to meet you?
LEADFEMALE:She didn't say.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't wanna ask.
LEADFEMALE:You think he might be her boyfriend? I didn't see any pictures of him when I went through her things.
LEADFEMALE:Went through her things? Why didn't you just ask? Hey! I don't stick my nose in where it doesn't belong.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:That must be them.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mama.
LEADMALE:This is Jeremy.
LEADFEMALE:Nice to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:A pleasure.
SUPMALE:Come in.
SUPMALE:Sit down.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:You have a lovely home.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:You seem like a nice young name.
LEADFEMALE:He is a nice young man.
SUPMALE:Becky, was she talking to you?
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Hors d'oeuvres are now being served.
SUPMALE:Meet my mother's friends.
LEADMALE:This is Dorothy, Sophia, and Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Nice to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:Jeremy, where did you and Rebecca meet? We met at a café in Paris.
OTHERMALE:There weren't any tables left, so I just sat at Becky.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we move out to the lanai for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:I'll show you the way.
SUPMALE:Let me help you.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Becky? Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm.
LEADMALE:That fettuccini was sensational.
LEADFEMALE:You ladies made a great meal.
OTHERFEMALE:As long as you're handin' out compliments, you haven't said anything about my outfit.
LEADMALE:That's not very nice.
SUPMALE:I'm trying to be nice.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I didn't say anything.
SUPFEMALE:You all get comfortable and I'll make a pot of hot coffee.
SUPMALE:Which I'd like to pour down his pants.
LEADMALE:How can you let him talk to Becky that way? Dorothy's right.
LEADMALE:I haven't heard anyone insult someone like that since Lars Svensson accused Erik the Red of being a coward and called him yellow.
LEADMALE:Wouldn't that make him Erik the Orange? I'm not about to meddle in Becky's personal life.
LEADMALE:I made that mistake once before.
SUPMALE:Blanche, this is different.
LEADMALE:He is downright cruel to her.
OTHERMALE:If Rebecca doesn't mind it, it is none of my business.
SUPMALE:She's only known him a short time.
LEADMALE:I'm sure she'll come to her senses before very long.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, you don't have to help with the dishes.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't listen to that anymore.
LEADFEMALE:You mean Jeremy's rude remarks.
LEADMALE:I mean Rebecca talking about marrying that jerk.
LEADMALE:Are you tellin' me Rebecca and Jeremy are plannin' to get married? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I overheard them talking.
SUPMALE:Maybe you misunderstood.
LEADMALE:Please.
LEADMALE:Me misunderstand? My bladder may be weak, my eyesight may be failing, my bones may be brittle I see your point.
LEADMALE:Maybe you better double-check.
SUPFEMALE:Rebecca, Jeremy, is there something you would like to tell me?
SUPMALE:As a matter of fact, yes.
SUPMALE:Please, Becky, let me do it.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, I'd like to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage.
LEADFEMALE:I'd take the rest of her, but I've got a bad back.
LEADFEMALE:Jeremy, be serious.
SUPMALE:Mama, Jeremy's asked me to marry him and I've said yes.
LEADFEMALE:You are happy for me, Mama? Happy? Happy.
SUPMALE:Honey! Happy isn't the word for it.
SUPMALE:Oh!
LEADMALE:Well, we're off to the game.
LEADMALE:I didn't know you played baseball.
OTHERMALE:We're not gonna play.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna see a game.
LEADMALE:Mama offered to drive us to see the Dodgers.
LEADMALE:Jeremy's a big baseball fan.
SUPMALE:Becky's a bigger one.
OTHERMALE:Becky's a bigger everything.
OTHERMALE:Not everything, Jeremy.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, we don't wanna miss anything.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna buy Becky a Dodger cap, see how many people mistake her for Tommy Lasorda.
OTHERFEMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:That is it! Now, calm down.
LEADMALE:We'll bring you back a cap, too.
LEADFEMALE:I can't take it anymore.
SUPMALE:I've gotta say something.
LEADMALE:I know how frustrating it is, but there's nothing we can do.
LEADFEMALE:It's her daughter.
SUPMALE:It's her choice.
LEADFEMALE:It's like something back in St.
SUPMALE:Olaf.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, stop.
OTHERMALE:When any one of us makes an observation, the first thing we hear is "Back in St.
OTHERMALE:Olaf.
LEADFEMALE:" Did it occur to you we might be tired of "Back in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf," "Back in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf'? Gee, no.
SUPFEMALE:I never realized.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's okay.
LEADFEMALE:Back in that town whose name
SUPFEMALE:Rose! We need the kitchen.
OTHERMALE:What's going on?
LEADFEMALE:A showdown with McCracken.
SUPFEMALE:Your boss is coming? A week on strike has had its effect.
SUPMALE:He wants to negotiate.
LEADMALE:I insisted we do it on our turf.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:That's him.
LEADFEMALE:Let him in.
LEADFEMALE:I gotta prepare the table.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you doing that, Sophia?
OTHERMALE:It's a power move.
LEADMALE:Three of us against one.
LEADFEMALE:And I get to look down on him.
LEADMALE:Ma, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:McCracken's here.
LEADFEMALE:Ladies, let's get down to business.
LEADMALE:I've got to get back for the lunch rush.
LEADMALE:We'll just leave you to your negotiations.
OTHERFEMALE:Can we get you some milk or some Double Stuf Oreos?
LEADFEMALE:No, thank you, ma'am.
LEADMALE:Boy, he's tough.
LEADFEMALE:Have a seat, boss.
SUPFEMALE:I've read your list of demands.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait, McCracken.
LEADMALE:Before you begin, I wanna tell you something.
LEADMALE:I'm no novice when it comes to negotiations.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, really?
LEADMALE:Let me tell you a story.
LEADFEMALE:Picture 
LEADFEMALE:Sicily, 1922.
SUPFEMALE:An attractive peasant girl, who has saved her lira, embarks on a glorious vacation to a Crimean resort on the Black Sea.
SUPMALE:For weeks, she frolics at the seaside resort and enjoys the company of many young men, all of whom adore her.
SUPFEMALE:All of them? Shut up, Edna.
OTHERMALE:I work alone.
LEADMALE:All of them.
SUPMALE:When it's time to return to Sicily, three different suitors beg her to stay.
LEADMALE:But she can't decide who to choose, so she chooses none of them.
LEADMALE:But she agrees to meet with them at the same resort many years later.
LEADFEMALE:To her trio of suitors, that eventful gathering was referred to as "Rendezvous With Sophia.
LEADMALE:" But to the rest of the world, it was better known as the Yalta Conference.
SUPFEMALE:You expect me to buy that? The only reason I came here was so you wouldn't cause a scene at the Chow Wagon when I fired you.
SUPFEMALE:Fired us? You heard me.
LEADMALE:No story is gonna change my mind.
LEADMALE:Not even the one we could tell your father about how his car got dented while you were doing wheelies and not while it was sitting in the parking lot? You wouldn't do that.
OTHERFEMALE:Would you? Hey.
SUPFEMALE:She's your grandmother.
LEADMALE:Has she ever lied to you? Is Jeremy coming in a taxi or driving to the airport?
OTHERMALE:He's takin' the car.
SUPMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:Well, that's good.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess this is it.
SUPMALE:Oh, I hate these moments.
SUPFEMALE:I never did learn how to say good-bye.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, there are so many ways to say farewell.
LEADMALE:Auf Wiedersehen, arrivederci, adiós, hasta luego,,, Get lost.
LEADMALE:See? There's another one.
LEADMALE:Good, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Didn't you hear me honking?
LEADMALE:We were saying good-bye.
LEADMALE:Well, hop to it.
SUPMALE:Kiss-kiss, hug-hug.
LEADFEMALE:We're outta here.
SUPMALE:Mama, thanks for being so understanding about our wedding.
OTHERMALE:That's me.
LEADFEMALE:Old, understandin' Mama.
LEADMALE:It's simpler if Jeremy and I run off and do it ourselves.
SUPMALE:That'll be the day when you run anywhere.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think you can be patient? I know things move slow here at Sunnybrook Farm, but we have a plane to catch.
LEADMALE:The kitchen.
SUPMALE:What? You heard me.
LEADFEMALE:Into the kitchen right now! Rebecca, I've held my tongue for two solid weeks, but I cannot any longer.
LEADFEMALE:I am your mother, and I cannot let you go out that door without asking you why, of all the men on God's green Earth, have you decided to marry that lump of nothin'? Because I want a husband, a family, and Jeremy may be my last chance.
OTHERMALE:That's just nonsense.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mama, look at me.
LEADMALE:Open your eyes.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not a catch.
LEADFEMALE:For that man, you certainly are.
LEADMALE:He's got you thinkin' that you need him.
LEADMALE:He's the one who needs you.
SUPMALE:You're the only woman on Earth who's kind and caring enough to give him a glance.
LEADFEMALE:He's not good enough for you! Do you hear what you're saying? You're doing it again.
SUPMALE:He's not good enough for you.
SUPFEMALE:Neither am I.
LEADFEMALE:I never have been.
SUPFEMALE:I wish I'd never come here.
LEADMALE:Rebecca.
SUPMALE:Becky Sue.
LEADMALE:Let's go, Jeremy.
SUPFEMALE:Finally.
LEADFEMALE:Rebecca.
OTHERFEMALE:Rebe Wait! Oh, damn! It's not like Blanche to go to bed at 8:00.
LEADMALE:At least not by herself.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche is depressed, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you think she's depressed about Rebecca? No, Rose.
OTHERMALE:She's depressed because Marblehead Manor is only on once a week.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:I remember when I was a little girl when we'd get depressed.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma could always cheer us up.
LEADMALE:She'd take out her dentures and she'd take a healthy swig from the aquarium, and then she'd put a flashlight under her chin and we could watch the goldfish swim from cheek to cheek.
SUPMALE:We could've watched it all day.
SUPFEMALE:But visiting hours were only from 10 to 4.
SUPMALE:I couldn't sleep.
SUPMALE:I just kept tossin' and turnin', thinkin' about the mistake I made.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, you did the right thing.
LEADFEMALE:You're only sayin' that.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, am I a bad mother?
LEADFEMALE:You did what you had to do.
LEADFEMALE:Why do I feel so terrible? Because it is not easy being a mother.
OTHERFEMALE:If it were easy, fathers would do it.
OTHERMALE:Why can't kids understand that we're tryin' to do what's best for 'em? They're kids.
LEADMALE:When they become mothers, they know better.
LEADMALE:Right, Dorothy?
LEADMALE:Right, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, I remember you used to make me bring my dates into the house to meet you and Pop.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, what an inconvenience.
LEADMALE:Between the ages of 12 and 19, I met two guys.
OTHERFEMALE:I remember my mother making me practice the tuba.
OTHERFEMALE:Three hours a day, seven days a week, for ten years.
LEADFEMALE:I hated it.
LEADFEMALE:But it finally paid off.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know you played the tuba.
SUPFEMALE:I don't.
SUPMALE:I gave it up.
SUPFEMALE:But I can blow 32 pounds of air into a tire in less than a minute.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:Who could that be at this hour? I'll see.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mama.
OTHERFEMALE:Rebecca, am I glad to see you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry about what I
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Don't apologize.
LEADMALE:You were right.
SUPMALE:What? I was thinkin' about what you said, how much courage it took.
SUPFEMALE:That's when I realized how much you love me.
OTHERMALE:Oh, baby.
SUPMALE:You were right about Jeremy, too.
LEADMALE:I can do better.
LEADFEMALE:Just took someone who loved me to point it out.
LEADMALE:Let's go tell the girls the good news.
SUPMALE:They're havin' cheesecake.
LEADFEMALE:Cheesecake.
LEADFEMALE:That sounds great.
SUPMALE:Why don't we just go sit out on the lanai.
LEADMALE:Good-bye, sugar.
SUPMALE:Have a good trip and call me.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:Call me.
LEADMALE: Ah-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I thought we agreed we weren't gonna talk about the children.
LEADMALE:
OTHERMALE:Hi, Sophia.
SUPMALE:What you cooking? Lasagna, for a guy at the center.
LEADMALE:Oh! Is he cute? Cute.
LEADMALE:He's 84, doesn't have a hair on his head or a real tooth in his mouth, and his body's covered with liver spots.
LEADMALE:To answer your question, he's adorable.
LEADMALE:Look at the great costume I got for the masquerade ball.
SUPMALE:I can't decide whether to be the front end or the rear end.
LEADMALE:I'm in a romantic mood.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna let that golden opportunity pass right by.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, hello.
SUPMALE:I got our costume for the ball at the counseling center.
SUPMALE:Is it time for that again? It's the biggest social event of the season.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, it'll be fun.
LEADMALE:It will not be fun.
LEADMALE:There is no fun in my life.
LEADMALE:Have you ever felt like you're stuck in a rut, going through the motions with no joy, pleasure or excitement? Sure.
SUPMALE:That was my sex life with your father.
SUPMALE:Ma, my job is routine.
OTHERFEMALE:I have virtually no social life.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing interests me.
LEADMALE:My life has just become dull and boring.
SUPFEMALE:Where's that sense of fun, that lighthearted laughter, that devil-may-care attitude? Sophia, when was Dorothy ever like that? Never.
SUPMALE:I've been asking her these questions since she's 12.
LEADFEMALE:You can't help it if you're dull and boring.
OTHERMALE:God did that to give the world some variety.
LEADMALE:Otherwise, everybody would be just like me.
LEADFEMALE:And there wouldn't be enough sailors to go around.
LEADMALE:Your life doesn't have to be dull.
OTHERMALE:It's up to you to make it interesting.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:Get off your duff and do something.
LEADFEMALE:There's a lecture at the school tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:Barbara Thorndyke is going to speak.
LEADFEMALE:Who's Barbara Thorndyke? A local novelist whose stories are all set in Florida.
LEADMALE:Wait a second.
LEADMALE:Barbara Thorndyke.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't she write Evil Wind Over Pensacola?
LEADFEMALE:You know it?
LEADFEMALE:I go to bed with it every night.
SUPMALE:What's it about?
SUPFEMALE:How should I know? My mattress frame lost a caster.
LEADFEMALE:I use it to keep the bed level.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Are we expecting company? Yep.
LEADMALE:Barbara Thorndyke.
SUPFEMALE:I introduced myself after the lecture.
LEADMALE:We went out and had coffee and talked for hours.
LEADFEMALE:What you talk about? Art, literature, world events, life.
LEADMALE:I haven't had that stimulating a conversation in years.
LEADFEMALE:If you're saying you can't get stimulating conversation around this house, I beg to differ.
LEADMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:It says since Michael Jackson can't buy the Elephant Man, he's put in a bid for the remains of the Big Bopper.
LEADMALE:You can't believe everything you read in that rag.
LEADFEMALE:It caters to people of the lowest intelligence.
LEADFEMALE:Then why do you buy it? Because it's the only newspaper Elvis will talk to from beyond the grave.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Where was I?
LEADMALE:It's not important.
OTHERMALE:Listen, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Let's put this away so that Barbara Thorndyke won't see it.
SUPMALE:Barbara Thorndyke is coming here? Wow.
LEADMALE:I've never met a real author before.
LEADMALE:I have.
LEADMALE:I once stood in line two hours at a bookstore for Arnold Schwarzenegger's autograph.
LEADMALE:When I think of great literary figures of our time, it's usually, uh, Faulkner, Fitzgerald, and Schwarzenegger.
SUPFEMALE:Schwarzenegger.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Did he sign your book?
SUPMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:But only after he refused to sign my thigh.
LEADMALE:He was probably intimidated to see a thigh bigger than his.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Anybody want a lasagna? I thought you made that for your friend.
LEADFEMALE:He said he had lunch already.
LEADFEMALE:I offered to go to his place and warm it up for supper.
SUPMALE:He said no.
LEADFEMALE:The key is to make a man think you're not interested in him.
SUPFEMALE:Offering to make him dinner made you look too easy.
LEADMALE:Please.
OTHERFEMALE:Black underwear and pasties couldn't make me look easy.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Barbara, please, come in.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Oh, hello.
LEADMALE:These are my friends.
SUPFEMALE:That's Blanche Devereaux.
LEADFEMALE:Rose Nylund.
LEADMALE:How do you do? Sit down.
OTHERFEMALE:Sit down.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Barbara, Dorothy tells us you're an author.
LEADMALE:No, I'm just a writer.
LEADMALE:Malamud's an author.
LEADFEMALE:I thought malamuds were chocolate cookies with marshmallows in the middle.
SUPMALE:Those are mallomars, Rose.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, I want you to have a copy of my latest novel.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Scarlet Dawn at Boca Raton.
LEADMALE:Read the inscription.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:"To Dorothy Zbornak, a new and fascinating friend.
LEADFEMALE:" Oh, thank you so much.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really touched.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get the coffee and let you get to know each other.
SUPMALE:Barbara, that is a stunning brooch.
LEADMALE:Wherever did you get it? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I was in Morocco working on a novel, not to mention a dashing young Moroccan, Oh! When I had a severe attack of writer's block.
LEADMALE:My head was devoid of all ideas and thoughts.
SUPFEMALE:That happens to me a lot.
SUPFEMALE:Do you write? No.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you ask? Go on, Barbara.
SUPFEMALE:I went for a walk in a crowded marketplace.
OTHERFEMALE:A man came up behind me, put something in my hand, and said, "This is what you need.
LEADFEMALE:" That happened to me once in the produce section at the A&P.
OTHERMALE:Well, anyway, the man gave me the brooch, and since then, I've never had any problem writing.
LEADMALE:This is my muse, my artistic inspiration, the embodiment of my creativity.
LEADMALE:And you know what's even better? It goes with anything.
LEADFEMALE:It might be a little tricky with plaid.
LEADFEMALE:I'd be careful if I were you.
LEADMALE:You missed the point of my story.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really? Run it by us again.
OTHERMALE:I think not.
LEADFEMALE:So, um, you bowl? I beg your pardon? How's it going? I've had the most delightful conversation with Rose and Madge.
LEADMALE:That's Blanche.
LEADMALE:Oh, of course.
SUPFEMALE:However I just remembered a previous engagement.
LEADFEMALE:I have to go.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's too bad.
LEADFEMALE:Well, at least let me walk you to your car.
OTHERMALE:What do you think? There's something about her I don't like.
SUPMALE:Me, too.
SUPMALE:I find her hard to talk to.
SUPMALE:Me, too.
OTHERFEMALE:She thinks I'm dumb.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, have you decided who you're gonna be at the ball? Yes.
SUPMALE:I'm going as Eve from the Garden of Eden.
LEADMALE:All I'll need is a few strategically placed leaves.
LEADFEMALE:What about a snake?
LEADFEMALE:I already have a snake.
OTHERMALE:I'm going with Hank Crinland.
LEADFEMALE:He's a whiplash attorney.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, Rose and I are going to the movies.
LEADFEMALE:You wanna go? I can't tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Barbara's taking me to the experimental theater downtown.
LEADFEMALE:Somebody dragged me to a show there one time.
LEADMALE:Three men paraded around the stage for five hours talking about God and eating graham crackers.
SUPFEMALE:They wore masks, but other than that, they were totally naked.
LEADFEMALE:You stayed through the whole evening? Well, I would've left, but one of the actors looked so familiar to me.
LEADMALE:But it was hard to tell since he had such a small part.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, come with us.
LEADFEMALE:You'll have a lot more fun.
OTHERFEMALE:Besides, that Barbara is so snooty.
LEADFEMALE:How can you say that? You hardly know her.
LEADMALE:Why doesn't she include us in plans she makes with you? Because you have different interests.
LEADMALE:Is it too much to ask of my best friends that they respect my right to have different interests and people in my life?
LEADMALE:I guess not.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:And I promise we'll do something together real soon.
LEADMALE:Okay? Maybe she's right.
LEADFEMALE:We didn't give Barbara much of a chance.
LEADMALE:First impressions can be wrong.
SUPMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:I remember when I was little back in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf.
LEADFEMALE:There was this old lady who lived up the street.
SUPFEMALE:She never smiled.
LEADMALE:She always looked angry.
SUPFEMALE:The kids said she'd kill anyone who even stepped on her property.
LEADFEMALE:We called her Mean Old Lady Higgenlooper.
LEADMALE:Yeah, kids can be pretty cruel.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:That was her name.
LEADMALE:Mean Old Lady Higgenlooper.
OTHERFEMALE:She had it changed legally 'cause everybody called her that anyway.
SUPFEMALE:Then how come your name isn't Big Dummy? There were already three other people in town with that name.
LEADFEMALE:But that's beside the point.
LEADMALE:One day I got up the courage to go up to Mean Old Lady Higgenlooper and ask her why she always frowned.
SUPFEMALE:Well, she had been born with no smiling muscles.
SUPFEMALE:I pointed out that a frown is just a smile turned upside down.
LEADFEMALE:So from then on, whenever I'd go by, she'd stand on her head and wave.
OTHERFEMALE:That is one of the stupidest stories I've ever heard.
LEADFEMALE:Which proves my first impression of you was right.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, I have an idea.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't we invite Barbara over for dinner and give her another chance? Why not? If it makes Dorothy happy.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go to the movies.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, what was your first impression of me? I thought you wore too much makeup and were a slut.
LEADMALE:I was wrong.
SUPFEMALE:You don't wear too much makeup.
SUPMALE:And so Dorothy Parker turned to Alexander Woollcott and said, "If you laid all the women in this room end to end, I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
LEADMALE:" Very clever.
SUPFEMALE:Very, very clever.
SUPFEMALE:I can't remember hearing anything more clever.
OTHERFEMALE:Unless it was last week on Alf, when the cat next door I'll go get the after-dinner drinks.
OTHERMALE:Barbara, I picked up your first novel the other day.
SUPMALE:Ah, yes.
LEADFEMALE:So Dark the Waves on Biscayne Bay.
LEADMALE:I've grown so much as a writer since then.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I should hope so.
OTHERMALE:Blanche.
SUPMALE:It's all right.
LEADFEMALE:Did you have a problem with my book? Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.
SUPFEMALE:All those waves.
OTHERFEMALE:Big waves, little waves.
SUPMALE:Dark waves rolling in.
LEADMALE:Page after page.
SUPMALE:I had to take a Dramamine to get through chapter three.
LEADMALE:Blanche, the waves are a metaphor.
SUPMALE:You see, a metaphor I know what a metaphor is, dear.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not a dummy.
SUPMALE:Blanche, what's a metaphor? It's when you use a phrase to mean something else.
LEADFEMALE:Like when I say, "Men are blinded by my beauty," they're not really blinded.
SUPFEMALE:They get their sight back in a day or two.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Barbara, this is my mother, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:Sophia, your daughter is one of the most beautiful people I've ever met.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, you writers never stop using your imagination.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Well, good-bye.
SUPFEMALE:Where are you going? It's Saturday night.
SUPFEMALE:I'm all dressed up.
SUPFEMALE:There's a car honking for me.
SUPFEMALE:Think, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Remember something called "a date"? Well, I'd better be going to.
LEADMALE:But it's still so early.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought we could all have a game of oogle and floogle.
LEADMALE:I don't believe I've ever heard of that.
SUPMALE:We used to play it back in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf.
LEADFEMALE:It's an adult version of hide-and-go-seek.
SUPFEMALE:And how does it differ from the children's version? Adults play it.
OTHERMALE:Of course.
LEADFEMALE:I should have known.
LEADMALE:I'll take a rain check.
LEADMALE:It was so nice of you to come by.
LEADMALE:I have an extra ticket for the writers symposium on Friday.
LEADMALE:Would you like to come? I'd love to, Barbara.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Anything for a friend.
OTHERMALE:Ciao.
LEADMALE:Ciao.
OTHERMALE:And good-bye to you, too, Barbara.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, the masquerade ball is Friday night.
LEADMALE:You know how much it means to me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm counting on you to be the rear end of my horse.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, sweetheart, this Friday I can choose between rubbing elbows with Norman Mailer, or doing the hokey-pokey in a horse costume with your behind in my face.
SUPFEMALE:Well, which is it gonna be? Rose, honey, pass me the tuffy.
LEADMALE:With pleasure, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:You're welcome, Blanche.
LEADMALE:You can always count on me to hand you the tuffy.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I always ask you.
SUPFEMALE:I think I saw Jack and Janet give Chrissy this treatment on an episode of Three's Company.
OTHERMALE:Oh, at last, a reference from Dorothy that even we illiterates can understand.
LEADFEMALE:I guess her well of knowledge has run dry.
LEADMALE:That's a metaphor, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Why is it so important that I go to this masquerade ball? Because it's so important to Rose.
LEADFEMALE:She's crushed, torn up, devastated by your shocking insensitivity to her feelings.
LEADFEMALE:I don't feel that bad.
OTHERFEMALE:Shut up, Rose.
SUPMALE:I never said I was going.
LEADFEMALE:Since when do we have to say we're going? We've gone for the past five years.
SUPFEMALE:We may hate it, but we always go.
OTHERMALE:You never told me you hated it.
LEADMALE:I'm a good friend.
OTHERMALE:A good friend would never say anything like that.
LEADMALE:I appreciate that.
SUPMALE:Just admit that this is because you don't like Barbara.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:I don't like Barbara.
LEADFEMALE:I think she's a phony.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:This from a woman who tells her dates that she was Angie Dickinson's body double in Dressed to Kill.
OTHERFEMALE:That's just a little white lie.
SUPMALE:Then why is it on your job resumé? Blanche is right, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Barbara is not very nice.
LEADFEMALE:She looks down on everybody except you.
SUPMALE:That's only 'cause you look up to her.
OTHERFEMALE:That is ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:You don't notice how she uses her intelligence to make everybody else look stupid.
LEADMALE:Like at supper when she asked us to pass the salt in Latin.
LEADMALE:She cares more about words than she does about people.
LEADMALE:You have a right to have your own friends, but it takes a good friend to point out your mistakes, and you're making one with Barbara.
LEADFEMALE:How dare you make judgments like that.
LEADFEMALE:And how dare you tell me who my friends should be.
LEADFEMALE:Barbara, this place is incredible.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:It's the hangout for Miami's literary intelligentsia.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I've never seen a menu with a table of contents before.
LEADFEMALE:Skip ahead to chapter five.
LEADMALE:It's the lunch menu.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, gee, everything sounds so good.
LEADMALE:The Crepes of Wrath.
LEADMALE:The Old Man and the Seafood Salad.
LEADMALE:I think I will have the For Whom the Stuffed Bell Pepper Tolls.
LEADMALE:I'll have a turkey sandwich on Catcher in the Rye bread with a side order of George Bernard Slaw.
LEADFEMALE:Barbara, I've really come to value our friendship.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I feel I can talk to you about something.
SUPMALE:Feel free.
LEADFEMALE:If I had a problem, I'd wanna confide in someone like me.
OTHERMALE:Ever since we became friends, there has been a great deal of tension between Blanche and Rose and me.
LEADMALE:I didn't mean to infringe on your friendship.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:It's not your fault.
SUPFEMALE:The problem is they feel left out of our friendship, and I don't know what to do about it.
LEADFEMALE:Face it, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Blanche and Rose are limited.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I admit I get tired of hearing about Blanche's dates and Rose's relatives back in St.
SUPFEMALE:Olaf, but they are very good friends.
LEADFEMALE:If you like them, I must have overlooked something.
LEADFEMALE:I have an idea.
LEADMALE:Why don't I invite everybody and their dates for dinner at the Mortimer Club? The Mortimer Club? Barbara, that is the most exclusive club in town.
OTHERMALE:Here we are, ladies.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't order the French fries.
LEADMALE:Oh, right.
LEADFEMALE:You get the Edgar Allan Poe-tatoes and the Ice Water Cometh.
LEADMALE:You know, a little of that goes a very long way.
SUPMALE:I'm having second thoughts about spending another evening with Barbara.
LEADMALE:I don't think it'll hurt to give her another chance.
LEADFEMALE:We're going to the Mortimer Club.
SUPFEMALE:What's the big deal? Rose, the wealthiest men in Florida go there.
LEADMALE:It's been my experience that wealthy men make the best lovers.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that true? No.
SUPFEMALE:But if you tell them that, sometimes they'll take you to the mall and let you use their credit card for 45 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, honey, I hope you don't mind.
SUPMALE:I borrowed your rhinestone necklace.
OTHERFEMALE:No, but I should point out it was designed for a dainty neck.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, Blanche, but I don't know Mike Tyson well enough to borrow his jewelry.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Madge.
SUPMALE:That's Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, didn't I say that? This is my date, Norman.
SUPFEMALE:He's a student in my creative writing course.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know you taught high school.
SUPMALE:Norman and I are the same age spiritually.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, if you can get him to buy that, more power to you.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Barbara.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Dorothy, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I certainly hope tonight will help us forget what happened the other night.
SUPFEMALE:I already forgot what happened the other night.
LEADMALE:But I'm 82 years old.
LEADMALE:This morning I forgot my cat's been dead for 20 years.
SUPFEMALE:Which makes me 
SUPMALE:Who's using the kitty litter?  Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Come in.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Murray, what a snazzy tux.
OTHERMALE:I better not let you out of my sight tonight.
LEADMALE:That's my daughter Dorothy.
LEADMALE:These are her friends.
LEADMALE:Everybody, I'd like you to meet Murray Guttman.
LEADFEMALE:How do you do? Murray, such a pleasure to meet you.
LEADMALE:Nice to meet you, too.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, could I see you in the kitchen for a second? We have a little problem.
SUPMALE:We do?
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Murray Guttman? Oh.
LEADMALE:Maybe we can get him to turn his jacket inside out.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sure the lining isn't as loud.
LEADFEMALE:His tuxedo has nothing to do with it.
LEADMALE:I don't understand.
SUPMALE:He can't come to the club.
LEADFEMALE:Why not?
SUPFEMALE:Guttman.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? Guttman.
LEADFEMALE:He's Jewish, isn't he? I don't know.
LEADMALE:What difference does it make? Oh, a big difference.
SUPFEMALE:The Mortimer Club is restricted.
SUPFEMALE:Why are you a member of a club like that? Because they serve a great breakfast and the parking is free.
OTHERMALE:Besides, it's their policy, not mine.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but you tolerate it.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, I tolerate a lot of things.
LEADFEMALE:For instance, I'm tolerating this evening with Rose and Blanche because of my friendship with you.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe I'm hearing this.
LEADFEMALE:Let's not make a big thing out of this.
SUPFEMALE:We can't go to the Mortimer Club.
LEADFEMALE:We'll go to another restaurant.
SUPMALE:Boy, did I misjudge you.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche and Rose were right.
SUPFEMALE:You are not the kind of person I want as a friend.
LEADFEMALE:Go to the Mortimer Club by yourself.
SUPMALE:I don't understand.
LEADMALE:Let me spell it out for you.
LEADMALE:Go to hell.
LEADMALE:Hmm? Dorothy, what happened? Barbara just stormed out of here.
SUPFEMALE:She's not coming back.
LEADMALE:Both of you were right about her.
LEADMALE:I can't believe that I couldn't see it.
OTHERMALE:Can you ever forgive me? What do you think? Should we give her another chance? We better.
LEADMALE:Best friends are hard to come by.
LEADMALE:Does this mean you'll go to the masquerade ball? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:And I'll tell you something.
LEADMALE:After all the practice I have had lately, I'd be honored to be the horse's behind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, oh, oh, oh! 
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Hi, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:You want some dinner? Forget dinner.
LEADMALE:Listen up, everybody.
LEADMALE:I've got something in this old lady purse that's gonna make you scream, holler and jump for joy.
SUPMALE:Are the batteries included? Hang on to your cannolis, because the four of us are gonna be contestants on Grab That Dough.
LEADMALE:Grab That Do Ma, do you mean that ridiculous game show where people humiliate themselves
LEADFEMALE:for the sake of a dollar?
LEADFEMALE:That's the one.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:I don't believe it.
SUPMALE:We're gonna be on TV.
LEADFEMALE:I've been trying to get us on for six months.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Grab That Dough is my favorite game show.
SUPMALE:Oh, mine too, and I think Guy Corbin is the cutest host on TV.
OTHERMALE:He's like Gene Rayburn, Chuck Woolery and Bob Eubanks, all rolled into one.
LEADMALE:That's an awful lot of teeth and polyester.
LEADMALE:Sophia, when are we gonna be on?
LEADFEMALE:Tomorrow afternoon in Hollywood.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding, Hollywood, California? No, Rose, Hollywood on the planet Romulak.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean, tomorrow? That's what it says on these tickets.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, they have to give us more time than that.
SUPMALE:Oh, Ma, these tickets were sent out four months ago.
SUPMALE:You gave them the wrong address.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Here it is, my old address from Sicily.
LEADMALE:Two miles west of Palermo, underneath the old bridge.
OTHERMALE:You used to live under a bridge? Yeah, we were wealthy.
LEADMALE:Most people didn't have a bridge to live under.
SUPMALE:Well, isn't that a shame.
SUPFEMALE:We won't be able to go.
OTHERMALE:Why not? You have a pressing engagement with a cheesecake? There's money involved here.
LEADFEMALE:You know what, girls? She's right.
SUPFEMALE:Now, we could catch the red eye.
SUPFEMALE:We could be in Hollywood tomorrow morning.
SUPMALE:By tomorrow afternoon, we would all be ready to  Grab that dough!  I can't believe that stupid airline lost our luggage.
OTHERFEMALE:What are we gonna do? Ask Blanche, she's the expert when it comes to checking into hotels without luggage.
SUPMALE:I can't believe somebody stole my bags.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it.
LEADMALE:With all the money we're gonna win, you'll replace those bags and everything in them.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, what about my bags?
LEADFEMALE:Relax, with your share, you can have your bags surgically removed.
OTHERMALE:Let's get to our rooms and get some sleep.
OTHERMALE:Good idea.
OTHERFEMALE:Good morning, I'm Nancy.
SUPMALE:How may I help you?
SUPFEMALE:We have two double rooms reserved under the name Zbornak.
SUPMALE:I'm afraid I just gave those two rooms away.
LEADMALE:But we had a reservation.
LEADFEMALE:Until 3am.
LEADMALE:You're late.
SUPFEMALE:Therefore the reservation is null and void.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, that's company policy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Well, I'm from Sicily and you know what our policy is?
SUPMALE:First, I break your knees.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, Ma.
SUPMALE:Look, forget about the reservation, just give us two double rooms.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid we're all booked up.
LEADFEMALE:First you give away our rooms.
SUPFEMALE:Now you tell us you're booked up.
LEADMALE:That's correct, madam.
OTHERMALE:It is? Hey, I'm pretty sharp for three in the morning.
LEADMALE:Here, let me handle this.
LEADFEMALE:Nancy, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I don't generally like to throw my name around, but you really leave me no choice.
SUPMALE:It so happens that I am Miss Angie Dickinson.
LEADMALE:And now, if you don't mind, I would like two rooms.
LEADMALE:You don't look like Angie Dickinson to me.
LEADMALE:I know, I have altered my appearance for a very important movie role.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it's about a woman who eats her way from behind the Iron Curtain.
LEADFEMALE:I think we just better go to another hotel.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid that would be an exercise in futility.
OTHERFEMALE:There's not a vacant room in the city.
LEADMALE:Girls, this is terrible.
LEADMALE:We're gonna be on national television in seven hours.
LEADFEMALE:We don't have any clothes, now we don't have a place to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I sympathize with your problem.
OTHERMALE:For $ 75 you can sleep in the lobby and I won't have you arrested for loitering.
LEADMALE:$ 75? That's a lot of money.
LEADMALE:I know, ma'am.
SUPMALE:That's why I want it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! Gee, this is just great.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, everything this whole night has been nothing but fun.
SUPMALE:You really need to get out more, Rose.
SUPMALE:Come on, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Admit you're having fun.
OTHERFEMALE:It's kind of like being on an adventure.
LEADFEMALE:An adventure, my foot! It's more like a nightmare.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna go on national TV in clothes we slept in all night.
LEADMALE:We'll look like hell.
SUPFEMALE:We'll be exhausted, we won't be able to answer any questions.
LEADMALE:Would you stop complaining? We've got it easy.
LEADFEMALE:Back in Sicily, I was on a game show.
LEADFEMALE:It was torture.
OTHERMALE:What was it called, Sophia?
SUPFEMALE:I just told you.
LEADMALE:Torture.
OTHERMALE:Mussolini asked the questions and you'd better have the right answers.
LEADMALE:Things 
LEADMALE:Who do you like better, me or Hitler? Who's got the snappiest boots, me or Hitler? Who's got the cuter girlfriend, me or Hitler? And you always had to answer, "Mussolini.
LEADFEMALE:" Otherwise, they forced you to play the lightning round.
LEADFEMALE:They used real lightning.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Ma, you're making this up.
LEADMALE:Like hell, I did.
LEADFEMALE:Goodson-Todman brought it to the U.
SUPFEMALE:S.
LEADMALE:, changed a few rules and called it Tattle Tales.
SUPMALE:Now count your blessings and go to sleep.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
SUPMALE:Fernando, you naughty boy.
LEADFEMALE:Not the feathers.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, Blanche, wake up.
LEADMALE:People are looking at you.
LEADMALE:What? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I think I was having an erotic dream.
LEADMALE:Your father used to do a thing with feathers when we were first married.
OTHERMALE:He was too lazy to pull them off the chicken so I put an end to that.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, next time you have an urge to stroll down memory lane, do me a 
LEADMALE:Go by yourself.
OTHERMALE:What time are we supposed to be at the studio? I don't know, I have to check the tickets.
LEADFEMALE:Hand me my purse, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have your pur Wait a minute, you have mine.
SUPMALE:I gave them to you.
LEADFEMALE:Hold everything.
OTHERFEMALE:I think my purse is missing.
OTHERFEMALE:So is mine! Girls, you know what this means? Somebody snuck in here while we were asleep and  Grabbed our dough! I'm sorry ladies, but without a description, there's absolutely nothing we can do.
LEADFEMALE:But if you remember anything, give me a call.
LEADMALE:How about if I just wanna say hello? Dorothy, I'm in the ladies room, I look in my brassiere, what do you think I find? Hopefully, what we all find when we look in our brassieres.
SUPMALE:I haven't been able to find those since I nursed your brother Phil.
LEADMALE:But I did find the tickets to the game show.
LEADMALE:Sophia!
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding! I forgot, I put them there for safekeeping.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Ma, I could just kiss you.
OTHERMALE:Uh, not until we locate a toothbrush, okay? Well, it is high time something went right on this trip.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, we have to figure out a way to get to the studio.
LEADFEMALE:We can always walk.
LEADFEMALE:It's only 39 blocks.
LEADMALE:If we start right now, we can still get there in time.
LEADFEMALE:I have a better idea.
LEADFEMALE:We can hitchhike.
OTHERMALE:I can lift my skirt, like that Clark Gable movie, It Happened One Night.
OTHERMALE:We'll have a ride in no time.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, you lift up your skirt, and someone might mistake your thigh for the on ramp to the freeway.
LEADFEMALE:Let's hit it! Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, aren't you Tiffany Blane? The lady on Grab That Dough who stands in front of stuff
OTHERFEMALE:and does this.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I am.
SUPMALE:How do you do? I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
OTHERFEMALE:This is my mother, Sophia Petrillo.
LEADFEMALE:And these are my friends, Rose and Blanche.
OTHERMALE:We're competing on today's show.
OTHERMALE:Well, hello, Tiffany.
LEADFEMALE:It's such a pleasure to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to know that I thought those pictures of you in that sleazy girlie magazine were so tastefully done.
SUPFEMALE:By the way, was that a real English bobby spanking you there in front of Big Ben? Now, ladies.
SUPMALE:Would you like to meet the other contestants? Oh, look, look.
LEADMALE:There's Guy Corbin.
OTHERMALE:Oh, what a hunk.
SUPMALE:Oh, that man makes my Ovaltine boil.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, ladies.
SUPFEMALE:Welcome to our show.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Guy Corbin.
LEADFEMALE:And this morning, I've arranged something especially for you.
LEADFEMALE:Fresh ground coffee and prune Danish.
LEADMALE:Tiffany? Why don't you tell them all about it right now.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, could I have a word with you just a minute?
LEADFEMALE:Of course.
SUPFEMALE:Listen.
OTHERMALE:I've been talking to the other two contestants, the Kaplan Brothers.
SUPMALE:I learned some very interesting things.
SUPFEMALE:Number one, they have won over $40,000 in cash and prizes on various game shows.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I think you and I should team up with them.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche.
LEADMALE:That's impossible.
LEADMALE:That would mean dumping Ma and Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I know, it's terrible.
LEADFEMALE:I feel awful thinking about it, but face it, if we team up with Fred and Willard, we stand a better chance of winning.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I am shocked that you would even suggest such a thing.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Your mother and Rose are dead weight.
OTHERMALE:Let's cut them loose before they drag us down.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, you expect me to betray one of my dearest friends, not to mention my own mother, just to win a few extra dollars.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I'll do it.
LEADFEMALE:All right, everyone.
LEADFEMALE:We're about to go on the air.
LEADMALE:Let's divide up into teams, and remember to jump up and down and scream a lot!
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Dorothy, we're on.
LEADMALE:Sophia, Rose, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Before you go out, there's something you ought to know.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna team up with the Kaplans.
LEADFEMALE:The Kaplan Brothers? You mean you and Dorothy are joining a country western band? That's the Gatlin Brothers, Rose.
SUPMALE:The Kaplan Brothers are those gentlemen standing there.
SUPFEMALE:You're dumping me and Rose for those two yutzes? Oh, Ma, believe me, it's for the best.
SUPFEMALE:If we split up, we double our chances of going home with something.
LEADFEMALE:Cut the bull.
SUPMALE:You don't want us 'cause you think we're too stupid.
SUPFEMALE:Thirty seconds to air, take your places, please.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be mad, Ma.
OTHERMALE:Get bent.
SUPMALE:We're gonna cream you.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:We're gonna maul you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:We're gonna beat you into the ground.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Okay, I'll give you Rose and $50 for your dumbest Kaplan Brother.
SUPMALE: It's time to play Grab That Dough with your host, Guy Corbin.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Hello, everybody! Welcome to Grab That Dough.
LEADFEMALE:The show where all you really need to know to win, is how to make a fist.
LEADFEMALE:Let's meet our lucky contestants.
OTHERMALE:First, on the green team, we have Dorothy Zbornak, an English teacher originally from Brooklyn, New York.
LEADMALE:She now lives in Miami with her mother, who will gladly pay anyone who will take her out for a date.
LEADMALE:Our second contestant is an artist with an incredible body.
LEADFEMALE:She runs her own museum, speaks Chinese and hopes to sail around the world before she turns 40.
SUPMALE:Wow, that must be a typo.
SUPMALE:Welcome, Blanche Devereaux!  Our next two contestants are brothers from Milwaukee.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, that entire introduction was nothing but lies.
LEADMALE:I know, and they just loved it.
LEADMALE:Did you hear that applause? Is that all you care about? Money and applause? And sex.
LEADFEMALE:For which I generally get applause.
LEADFEMALE:Our next contestant is a family counselor.
LEADMALE:She originally hails from St.
OTHERMALE:Olaf, Minnesota, where she was voted the girl most likely to get stuck in a tuba.
SUPFEMALE:Welcome, Rose Nylund.
LEADFEMALE:And last, but not least, is a grandmother of six.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia Petrillo.
SUPMALE:Sophia, it says here that you and Dorothy are mother and daughter.
LEADFEMALE:No, Guy.
LEADFEMALE:Rose is my daughter now.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, you're the biggest disappointment to hit the streets since the AMC Pacer.
SUPFEMALE:Say, it's time to play Grab That Dough.
LEADFEMALE:Hands on buzzers.
LEADFEMALE:Let's begin with our trivia lightning round.
LEADMALE:What famous Tennessee Williams play was recently made into a film
SUPMALE:by Paul Newman?
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Willard.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Was it The Glass Menagerie?
SUPFEMALE:That's correct for 100 points.
LEADMALE:What innovative industrialist invented the assembly line?
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Willard.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, I did it again.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Henry Ford.
OTHERMALE:That's correct.
LEADFEMALE:For another 100 points, who is the current Secretary of State? 
LEADMALE:Willard.
LEADMALE:Charles Schulz.
LEADFEMALE:He created Peanuts.
SUPFEMALE:I thought that was George Washington Carver.
LEADFEMALE:Willard, don't ever touch your buzzer again.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Rose.
OTHERMALE:Is the correct answer George Schultz?  That's correct.
OTHERMALE:Rose is on a roll and the blue team is leading 300 to nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I won!
LEADMALE:Shut up, Nylund.
SUPFEMALE:You shut up.
SUPMALE:Why don't you both shut up and answer this next question.
SUPMALE:For 100 points, complete this famous 
LEADFEMALE:"Better late than"
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Blanche.
SUPMALE:Pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:That's incorrect.
LEADFEMALE:But certainly not untrue.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Rose.
SUPMALE:Guy, is it "Better late than never"? Right you are, Rose.
OTHERMALE:That signals the end of the trivia lightning round.
LEADFEMALE:The blue team leads with 400 points while the green team trails with a big fat zero.
SUPFEMALE:We'll be right back to take a spin on the big money wheel, right after this commercial message.
LEADMALE:We're clear.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:So, Dorothy, how does it feel to have a big fat zero? We'll catch up! I wasn't talking about your score, I was talking about your partner.
LEADFEMALE:We're too dumb, huh? We're gonna whip your heinies.
LEADFEMALE:The game's not over yet, Nylund.
LEADMALE:It is for you, Devereaux.
LEADMALE:Five seconds.
LEADFEMALE: Once again, here's Guy Corbin.
SUPFEMALE:Welcome back.
SUPMALE:It's time to spin the big money wheel on Grab That Dough.
SUPMALE:Spinners, mosey on down.
OTHERMALE:We'll start first with Blanche from the green team.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, show us your stuff.
SUPMALE:You first, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Game Show Host.
SUPMALE:Blanche, spin the wheel.
LEADFEMALE:You're landing on
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Grab that dough! Yes, Blanche, you landed on "grab that dough.
SUPFEMALE:"
SUPFEMALE:You know what that means?
LEADMALE:Yeah, we're shafted.
SUPMALE:That's right, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:The green team automatically wins a chance to grab that dough at our magic money machine.
SUPMALE:Come this way.
OTHERMALE:Now, green team, you have 15 seconds to grab as much money as you can.
LEADMALE:Who's going to grab today? I'm going to grab today, Guy.
SUPMALE:Wonderful, you ought to make quite a haul with those meathooks.
SUPMALE:Tiffany.
SUPMALE:Let's have our big money smock and the big money goggles.
LEADMALE:Remember, Dorothy, you need to grab $500 to beat the blue team and get a chance at what's behind the window.
SUPMALE:Ready? She's all ready to grab that dough!
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, time's up.
LEADMALE:Oh! Let's see how she did.
LEADMALE:Help her out.
OTHERMALE:Okay, Dorothy, let's see how you did.
LEADFEMALE:seven, eight, $900! The green team makes a miraculous comeback and wins the game! Oh, blue team, we don't want you to go away empty handed, you have $400, that's $100 a piece, and you have the home version of Grab That Dough which attaches to any vacuum cleaner.
SUPMALE:Thank you for being with us.
SUPMALE:Cram it, piano teeth.
LEADMALE:Now, green team, what are you going to do with all that dough? Are you going to keep it, or are you going to trade it for what's behind one of our windows? I say, let's go for the window.
LEADFEMALE:No, we have to discuss this with everyone.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Guy, we're gonna go for what's behind the window.
SUPMALE:Will you take window one,  window two,  or window three?  Window three, Guy.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, but first, let's see what you didn't pick.
LEADFEMALE:Behind window one, brand new living room furniture.
OTHERFEMALE:Retail price for this magnificent prize, $12,000.
SUPMALE:But that's not what you picked.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks for pointing that out.
LEADFEMALE:You're welcome, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Let's see what's behind window two.
LEADFEMALE:It's a brand new car.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, it's that beautiful sports car you've always dreamed of.
SUPMALE:Retail price, $23,000.
LEADMALE:Now, Dorothy, Blanche, Willard and Fred, it's time to see what you did pick.
LEADFEMALE:Are you ready?
LEADMALE:We're ready.
OTHERMALE:Yes, yes.
SUPFEMALE:Because have I got something for you a brand new electric skillet! A what?  An electric skillet that's from Fry Quick.
LEADFEMALE:It not only fries, it boils, it bakes, it simmers It stinks! My apologies to the Fry Quick corporation.
OTHERMALE:But green team, we're not finished with you yet.
LEADFEMALE:You need something to go in that skillet.
SUPFEMALE:A car! We want a car! No, a lifetime supply of soup! Yes, it's soup, soup and more soup.
LEADMALE:Every kind you can imagine and it's yours for the rest of your lifetime.
LEADMALE:Well, that's our show for today, folks.
OTHERFEMALE:Contestants, come on down and give a Grab That Dough goodbye.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Thank goodness we're home.
LEADFEMALE:That's the worst trip I've ever been on.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, how can you say that? How can she say that? We lost our luggage, we slept in a hotel lobby, our purses were stolen We won zippo on the game show.
SUPFEMALE:But we still have our friendship.
LEADFEMALE:We made up on the plane There was nothing else to do.
LEADFEMALE:It was either that or watch Three Amigos with the headset.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I am gonna forget all about this while soaking in a nice warm tub.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
OTHERMALE:Rose, we only have one tub.
LEADFEMALE:I get the deep end.
LEADFEMALE:Rose! Ma.
SUPMALE:Ma, you're still mad at me, aren't you? Dorothy, you let greed cloud your judgment.
SUPFEMALE:Money blinded you.
SUPMALE:You turned your back on the people you love.
SUPFEMALE:You did a terrible, terrible thing.
SUPFEMALE:It's unforgivable.
SUPMALE:Ma, isn't there anything I can do to make it up to you?
LEADFEMALE:Give me $100.
SUPMALE:Make it 50.
LEADFEMALE:Done, I love you.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, what you making? Lasagna al forno.
LEADFEMALE:Smells delicious.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:My great Aunt Nicolinda used to say, "Making lasagna al forno is like crossing a river.
SUPFEMALE:If you roll up your pants, don't be surprised if you find clams nipping at your heels.
SUPMALE:What'd she mean?
LEADFEMALE:How should I know? She was a hopeless alcoholic.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:Have a taste.
SUPMALE:Ooh.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, girls.
SUPMALE:How did the audition for the play go? Awful.
LEADFEMALE:We just got two tiny parts.
SUPFEMALE:We're doing Sound of Music, and Blanche didn't get the lead.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you weren't cast in the lead.
LEADMALE:You've gotten it the past five years.
LEADFEMALE:They hired a new director, and he has no taste.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche used to sleep with the old one.
LEADFEMALE:The new director's gay.
LEADFEMALE:A gay theater director.
LEADFEMALE:Did you ever hear of such a thing? It's absolutely shocking.
LEADMALE:Next thing you know they'll have black basketball players in the NBA.
OTHERMALE:Ma, you are making lasagna al forno.
SUPMALE:What is the occasion? There's no occasion.
SUPMALE:I just know it's your favorite.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
SUPMALE:This takes 12 hours to make.
SUPMALE:What do you want? Nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:And it takes 16.
LEADMALE:The only time you make lasagna al forno is for funerals and favors.
LEADMALE:You're not wearing black, so what do you want? Nothing.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, you're a sick, suspicious, paranoid person.
LEADFEMALE:Stan, my favorite ex-son-in-law.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! God! Stanley, what the hell are you doing here? Don't talk to him like that.
SUPMALE:I invited him.
LEADMALE:What?
OTHERMALE:I love your toupee, Stanley.
LEADMALE:Is it new?
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:The guy at the shop calls it the Dan Rather model.
LEADFEMALE:You think it makes me look more intellectual? Oh, absolutely.
SUPMALE:By the way, Stanley, your fly is open.
OTHERMALE:I'm so embarrassed.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it.
SUPFEMALE:I hear that Dan Rather has the same problem.
SUPMALE:That's why he sits behind a desk.
OTHERMALE:Ma, listen, I want some answers.
LEADMALE:Now, why did you prepare my favorite meal and then invite my least favorite person to come eat it with us? All right.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:I need a favor.
LEADFEMALE:Remember my brother Angelo? He was at your wedding.
SUPMALE:He's a priest who lives in Sicily.
SUPFEMALE:He's going to Brooklyn next week and insisted on stopping off in Miami one day to wish you two a happy 40th wedding anniversary.
LEADMALE:But we're not married anymore.
LEADMALE:Which brings me to the lasagna al forno.
LEADMALE:I want you to pretend you're still married and that we're all living here.
OTHERMALE:I will not take part.
LEADMALE:The institution of marriage is sacred.
LEADFEMALE:I'll give you 50 bucks.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, it's only for one afternoon.
SUPFEMALE:It'll break your uncle's heart if you're divorced.
LEADMALE:Ma, forget it.
SUPFEMALE:We're divorced because Stanley cheated on me.
LEADFEMALE:He is a loathsome, repulsive creature.
SUPMALE:Even the thought of pretending to be married makes me ill.
OTHERMALE:Fine, but I'm still staying for dinner.
SUPMALE:If you don't do this, I'll never speak to you again.
SUPMALE:I don't care.
LEADFEMALE:I'll invite Stan over every night.
LEADMALE:How bad can it be? It's just for the day.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I just pressed our costumes.
OTHERMALE:I'm nervous about the rehearsal tonight.
LEADFEMALE:What do you say we go over our lines again.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Can we take it from the top of scene three? I'm standing on the balcony of the von Trapp home listening to artillery shells bursting in the distance, and you come running on from upstage.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:You ready?
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:The Nazis are coming! The Nazis are coming! Everybody, grab a gun and go in the basement! Come on! Move.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, no, no.
SUPMALE:Sophia, now, just relax.
LEADMALE:We're just going over our lines for The Sound of Music.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank God.
LEADMALE:Whooo, it is really coming down.
LEADFEMALE:What's coming down? The Liberace marquee at Caesar's Palace.
SUPFEMALE:Rain! Rain, Rose! Where is that idiot Stan? Angelo will be here any minute.
LEADMALE:I don't know where he is.
LEADMALE:Stan's always late.
LEADMALE:He was late for our first date.
SUPFEMALE:And then you were late.
LEADFEMALE:Which is why you had to marry that stupid, lazy, no-good, pinhead of a prince.
LEADMALE:This man is a prince.
SUPMALE:Come in, Stan.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry I'm late.
SUPFEMALE:The rain really tied up the traffic.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, girls.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Mama Bear.
LEADMALE:Papa Bear's back in the cave.
OTHERMALE:I could vomit just looking at you.
LEADMALE:That must be Angelo.
LEADFEMALE:You two go put the back.
LEADMALE:He can't see you here.
OTHERFEMALE:Go ahead.
LEADMALE:Go.
SUPFEMALE:Go.
SUPFEMALE:Angelo! Sophia! You look terrific.
LEADFEMALE:You haven't changed a bit in 40 years.
LEADFEMALE:Angelo, you're a priest.
SUPFEMALE:You shouldn't lie.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry about it.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it.
SUPMALE:Before the trip, I said an extra 50 Hail Marys in case I felt like a-cutting a-loose.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy! Uncle Angelo, it is so good to see you.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, you know something? You look more beautiful now than you did on your wedding day.
LEADFEMALE:You just used up all 50 Hail Marys on that one.
SUPFEMALE:Stanley, you're still a funny guy.
LEADMALE:You got a sense of humor still, huh? He still make you laugh? Not really.
LEADFEMALE:But then again, I haven't seen him naked lately.
LEADFEMALE:Would you listen to those two.
SUPFEMALE:Always with the quips.
LEADFEMALE:So, tell me, how are the children? Oh, Uncle Angelo, they're all grown up.
LEADMALE:How nice.
LEADMALE:Kate is an interior decorator in New York, and Michael is a very successful musician.
LEADMALE:Michael didn't want go in the novelty business with me.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:It was a crushing blow when he decided to join the Boston Philharmonic instead of selling rubber dog poop door-to-door.
LEADMALE:Don't knock the novelty business, snookums.
LEADMALE:Rubber dog poop and joy buzzers provided nicely for you, the kids And several stewardesses.
LEADMALE:Stewardesses? Uh, they adopted them.
LEADMALE:After Asian babies, they're the most popular.
LEADMALE:Ma, could I please see you in the kitchen? Hurry back, Mama Bear.
LEADFEMALE:Papa Bear gets lonely without you.
SUPFEMALE:Ow! Things are going very nicely.
SUPFEMALE:I am going to tell Uncle Angelo the truth.
LEADFEMALE:It's only for a couple of hours more.
SUPFEMALE:I can't do it.
LEADFEMALE:Pretending we're married, acting as though nothing happened is making me crazy.
LEADMALE:It's time to take my heart medicine.
LEADFEMALE:You need water to take your pill? No pills.
LEADMALE:I'll take a shpt of Scotch, 12 years old, if you've got it.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Angelo, I have a confession to make.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:I get my Scotch, and we go in the closet.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's about Stan and me.
LEADMALE:You know something, Dorothy? On your wedding day, Sophia told me, she said your marriage is never gonna last.
SUPMALE:That made me very sad.
SUPMALE:And now I see you and Stan so happy after all these years, it does an old man's heart good.
SUPMALE:And so does-a that.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Angelo I'm so glad I disobeyed doctor's orders and risked this long trip to see the both of you so much in love.
SUPFEMALE:Now, what were you saying? Uncle Angelo, I wanted to say Well, don't just stand there, Papa Bear.
SUPFEMALE:Come give Mama Bear a big bear hug.
LEADMALE:Can I get you another slice of cake, Uncle Angelo?
LEADFEMALE:No, thank you.
SUPMALE:I'll take a slice, darling.
SUPFEMALE:No problem, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Hurry back, dumpling.
LEADMALE:My feet have wings, barf bag.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, please, hang in there.
LEADMALE:A little while longer, Angelo will be on a plane for Brooklyn.
SUPFEMALE:I wish I'd taken my raincoat.
OTHERFEMALE:Why are you two dressed like that? These are our costumes for the play, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:We were in the middle of rehearsal when they told us to go home.
SUPFEMALE:There's a hurricane heading for Miami.
LEADMALE:I will take a slice of cake.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Uncle Angelo, I'd, uh, like you to meet, uh uh I'm Sister Rose.
LEADFEMALE:How do you do? Nice to meet you.
OTHERMALE:I'm Sister Blanche.
LEADMALE:Glad to meet you.
SUPMALE:We're here, uh, collecting lingerie for needy sexy people.
LEADFEMALE:The airports are closed.
LEADMALE:There's a hurricane headed this way.
LEADMALE:They want everyone to stay where they are.
LEADFEMALE:That means we could be trapped together for days.
SUPMALE:Oh, Jesus! Please protect us and watch over us in this our hour of need.
SUPFEMALE:Amen.
LEADMALE:Boy, it's really coming down put there.
SUPMALE:I've never been through a hurricane before.
LEADFEMALE:There's nothing to be afraid of.
LEADMALE:I've been through hurricanes.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, they could be kind of fun.
LEADFEMALE:I remember one when I was married.
SUPMALE:Married?
LEADFEMALE:Mary.
LEADMALE:I was Mary in the Christmas pageant at the convent.
SUPFEMALE:Remember that, Sister Rose? Oh, my, yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Sister Blanche is quite an actress.
OTHERFEMALE:She'd have to be to make anyone believe she was a virgin.
LEADFEMALE:Stanley, you're a pig in a cheap suit.
SUPMALE:You know, for two cents
OTHERMALE:You could get a better toupee? I've had enough.
OTHERMALE:I'm not going on with this anymore.
LEADMALE:Angelo, look.
LEADMALE:St.
LEADMALE:Francis of Assisi.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up and play ball, you yutz.
LEADFEMALE:False alarm.
LEADMALE:Never mind.
LEADFEMALE:Let's all go to bed.
LEADMALE:Angelo, you can sleep in my room.
LEADMALE:Well, won't it be crowded? Please.
SUPFEMALE:In Sicily, we slept four in a bed.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but there's six of us.
LEADFEMALE:I meant just you and me.
LEADMALE:Oh-hp! Fancy.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go to bed.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I'm beat.
SUPMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:Me, too.
OTHERMALE:Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Ow!
SUPMALE: Who is it? It's Uncle Angelo.
LEADMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, would you do me a favor? Oh, of course, Uncle Angelo.
LEADFEMALE:Anything.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to sleep with this man.
OTHERFEMALE:Forget it.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, I'm a-begging you as a man of the cloth.
LEADMALE:Now I know how Jessica Hahn must have felt.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm sorry, Uncle Angelo.
OTHERMALE:We had a fight.
OTHERFEMALE:I know, and I wanna go to bed.
OTHERFEMALE:So you two kids, please make up.
SUPMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:We're made up.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Sweet dreams.
LEADMALE:I know it's been a while, but control yourself.
OTHERMALE:I need some rest.
LEADFEMALE:What is that for?
LEADMALE:You're not getting into this bed.
LEADMALE:Where am I supposed to sleep?
LEADFEMALE:On the floor like any dog.
LEADMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Stan Zbornak doesn't have to beg a woman to get into bed.
LEADFEMALE:Women come to me.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:After they get the approval number on your MasterCard.
LEADMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, shut up.
SUPFEMALE:Stanley, if you're doing what I think you're doing, you're in big trouble.
LEADFEMALE:I was remembering the first time you kicked me put of bed and I had to sleep on the floor.
LEADFEMALE:Emil Zuntz's Hidden Honeymoon Hideaway in the Poconos.
LEADFEMALE:Where every cottage is April in Paris.
LEADFEMALE:And every bathroom Calcutta in July.
OTHERFEMALE:You remember how I convinced you to let me back in? No.
SUPMALE:I've got a  Crush on you  Sweetie pie  All the day and nighttime  Hear me sigh  Stanley Zbornak, I don't believe that you're trying to charm me.
SUPMALE:Is it working?
OTHERMALE:I don't think so.
LEADMALE:You leave me no choice.
LEADMALE:I'll have to pull put the big gun.
OTHERMALE:You're wasting your time, Stanley.
LEADMALE:I'm familiar with the big gun.
LEADFEMALE:Here goes.
SUPFEMALE:Embrace me  My sweet embraceable you  Embrace me  You irreplaceable you  Dorothy! Dorothy, I just had a terrible nightmare.
LEADMALE:Ma, what was it?
SUPFEMALE:This.
LEADMALE:Break it up.
SUPFEMALE:Stanley, think of me as the Berlin Wall.
LEADFEMALE:Try to climb over me, and you'll know what barb wire between your legs feels like.
LEADMALE:Gotcha.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, how did this start?
OTHERFEMALE:Cole Porter?
SUPMALE:Gershwin.
LEADMALE:Thank God I came in time.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:I'll get it.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Walter.
LEADFEMALE:How are you? Yeah, I feel like a caged animal in heat, too.
LEADMALE:Oh! Walter, you naughty boy.
SUPFEMALE:Keep on talking.
LEADMALE:What am I wearing? Well, to be perfectly honest, a nun's outfit.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! That sounds good to me.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be over there just as soon as this storm lets up.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:He's a leper.
LEADMALE:I'm the only one who'll touch him.
SUPFEMALE:Good morning, everyone.
LEADMALE:Good morning.
LEADFEMALE:I'll make breakfast.
SUPFEMALE:It's such a shame, you two stuck here on your 40th anniversary.
LEADFEMALE:Stuck with us.
LEADFEMALE:Fortieth anniversary? Sure.
OTHERMALE:Today's the 25th, isn't it? Yes.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I guess it is.
SUPMALE:I remember when my parents celebrated their 40th anniversary.
LEADFEMALE:They did the cutest thing.
SUPMALE:They renewed their marriage vows.
LEADMALE:You two should do that.
SUPMALE:You've got a priest right here.
LEADMALE:It'll be perfect.
OTHERMALE:It's sweet.
SUPMALE:It's romantic.
LEADFEMALE:It's spontaneous.
SUPMALE:It's the dumbest idea I've ever had.
OTHERMALE:I think it's a great idea.
OTHERMALE:What?
OTHERMALE:What? Snookums, could I see you in the living room? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell is wrong with you? Are you put of your mind? Dorothy, just hear me put.
LEADMALE:The last two days, you and me being here brought back a lot of good memories.
LEADFEMALE:Last night when you and I were in bed together, I felt something.
LEADFEMALE:That was my mother's knee.
SUPMALE:Besides that.
SUPFEMALE:There was still some of the old magic there.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I know we loused things up the last time.
SUPMALE:I loused things up.
LEADFEMALE:But now we have a chance to give it another try.
LEADMALE:Babe, I missed you.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna go through with the ceremony.
LEADFEMALE:Then we'll go down to city hall and make it legal.
SUPFEMALE:Stan
SUPMALE:Dorothy, it's fate.
SUPMALE:Divine intervention.
LEADMALE:The hurricane.
LEADMALE:Us pretending we're married.
OTHERMALE:If God didn't want us together, he would never have sent a priest.
SUPMALE:I'm not a priest.
SUPMALE:Angelo, what do you mean you're not a priest? I cannot go on with this deception any longer.
LEADMALE:I can't marry you.
SUPMALE:I'm not a priest.
SUPFEMALE:I never was.
LEADMALE:Uncle Angelo, what are you talking about? I gotta sit down.
SUPFEMALE:Let me tell you a story.
LEADMALE:Picture 
LEADMALE:Sicily, 1914.
SUPMALE:I promised our dear sainted mother on her deathbed I'm-a gonna join the priesthood.
LEADMALE:On my way to the seminary in Palermo, I stop off in a local trattoria for a glass of Chianti.
SUPFEMALE:The waitress bring drink to the table is a vision.
LEADMALE:Luscious lips, full bosom and a behind so round, so firm, you got to fall down on your knees and cry put at its magnificent regal beauty.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a butt man.
LEADMALE:Anyway, my devotion to God doesn't waver.
OTHERMALE:But suddenly, the idea of living with a bunch of guys in itchy robes doesn't seem quite as appealing as that tuckus.
OTHERFEMALE:So I tear up my priest application, ask Filomena to marry me, and we lived the next 72 years in wedded bliss.
SUPMALE:Why did you keep it a secret all these years? I was afraid my family gonna turn on me they find put I broke a promise to Mama on her deathbed.
LEADFEMALE:I promised Mama I'd marry Benito, the town's organ grinder monkey hat manufacturer.
SUPMALE:And you didn't do it?
OTHERFEMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:I loved my mother dearly, but I had my own life to live.
LEADMALE:You did, too, Angelo.
LEADMALE:Can you ever forgive me?
SUPMALE:Oh, of course, Uncle Angelo.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, we've all been deceitful, too.
OTHERMALE:Stanley and I are divorced.
SUPFEMALE:I hope you're not disappointed.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I'm thrilled.
LEADMALE:I never liked him.
SUPMALE:He's a yutz.
LEADMALE:And we're not really nuns.
LEADMALE:We're actually gorgeous private citizens.
SUPFEMALE:Now I'm confused.
LEADMALE:Come to the kitchen.
SUPFEMALE:I'll fix you some breakfast and explain the whole thing.
LEADFEMALE:Look, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:The storm's letting up.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna run right over to Walter's.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't you gonna change? No.
LEADFEMALE:It's still pretty windy.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go outside and see if I can get airborne.
LEADMALE:Well, I'd better get going, too.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Stan.
OTHERFEMALE:About what you said.
LEADMALE:Hey, Dorothy, uh, I was kidding.
LEADFEMALE:It was a joke.
OTHERFEMALE:That's what I figured.
SUPMALE:Well, you didn't think I meant it, did you?
SUPMALE:Well, no.
LEADMALE:Of course not.
LEADMALE:Of course not.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm strictly cheerleaders, wild parties, and hot tubs.
SUPMALE:Stan, before I forget, a deal's a deal.
SUPFEMALE:Here's your 50.
LEADMALE:That's okay, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:This one's on the house.
SUPMALE:Pull yourself together, pussycat.
LEADMALE:Gershwin confused a lot of people.
LEADMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell are you doin' home? I thought you had a beauty appointment.
SUPFEMALE:I did.
OTHERFEMALE:They finished early.
SUPMALE:On Christie Brinkley, they can finish early.
LEADFEMALE:You need every minute they can spare.
SUPMALE:Now get back there.
SUPFEMALE:He's here, isn't he?
OTHERMALE:Who?
LEADMALE:Who? Rocco.
SUPMALE:Rocco.
LEADFEMALE:Let me refresh your memory.
SUPFEMALE:The man you met in the police lineup.
LEADMALE:I was there to identify the guy who stole my purse.
LEADFEMALE:Rocco was there on a trumped-up charge.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, they caught him on a billboard spray-painting something obscene on Spuds MacKenzie.
LEADMALE:The dog they use in those ads is really a female.
LEADMALE:Rocco was just making Spuds anatomically correct.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, I'm telling you, the man is bad news.
LEADMALE:He has no job.
LEADFEMALE:He gambles.
LEADMALE:What kind of future does he have? Future? Please.
LEADMALE:He's 85.
LEADMALE:The man's got so little time, he only uses the ten-items-or-less line at the supermarket.
LEADFEMALE:Look who came to say hello, Rocco.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Always a pleasure.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice seeing you.
LEADFEMALE:Cut the crap and put out the stogie, Rocco.
LEADMALE:I like your style.
OTHERMALE:Right suit, right haircut, voice a little higher, you could pass as Frank Nitti.
SUPFEMALE:What the hell are you talking about? A little higher, I think you got it.
OTHERFEMALE:You really knew Frank Nitti? Well, sure.
LEADMALE:Frank Nitti, Dutch Schultz, Al Capone.
LEADFEMALE:Are you saying you were in the Mob? I ran Detroit.
LEADMALE:The marathon.
LEADFEMALE:He ran the Detroit marathon.
LEADMALE:Come on, come on.
SUPFEMALE:We're in the middle of a hand.
SUPMALE:Four of a kind.
SUPFEMALE:Beat that.
LEADMALE:Straight flush.
OTHERFEMALE:Pay me, honey.
SUPMALE:Ma, what are you doing?
LEADFEMALE:Losing.
LEADFEMALE:It's strip poker.
SUPFEMALE:That's it! Game's over.
SUPMALE:Who do you think you are? Donald Trump? You don't own this casino.
LEADMALE:She's always telling me what to do.
SUPMALE:My daughter treats me the same way.
OTHERFEMALE:Kids.
LEADMALE:Once they're over 50, they think they know everything.
OTHERFEMALE:I cannot believe my mother is hanging with that cheap hood.
SUPFEMALE:You mean Rocco?
LEADFEMALE:No, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I mean Spiro Agnew.
LEADFEMALE:He gave her a highway contract instead of an ID bracelet.
LEADMALE:Of course I mean Rocco!
SUPFEMALE:I think he's kinda cute.
LEADFEMALE:He is not cute.
LEADFEMALE:He is a bad influence.
LEADMALE:Since Ma started seeing him, she's on the phone all day, stays up all night.
LEADFEMALE:Yesterday, she came home with NyQuil on her breath and his surgical stockings in her pocket.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, can I ask you something? I don't know what it means.
LEADMALE:I just don't like the possibilities.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:I wanted to ask, do you think Blanche has been picking on me lately? I haven't noticed.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:Must you always be so cheerful, you empty-headed Mary Poppins knockoff? Let me know if you notice anything.
SUPMALE:Blanche, what's with you and Rose? I'll tell you what.
LEADMALE:This.
OTHERMALE:What is it?
LEADMALE:Rose's diary.
LEADMALE:What are you doing with it?
LEADMALE:It was lying on the table.
LEADMALE:I picked it up, and the lock just popped open just like this.
LEADMALE:Listen to 
SUPFEMALE:"Dear Diary, I don't know how much longer "I can stand living with these two pigs.
LEADMALE:"Moving in with them seemed like a good way "to save money, but it's getting out of hand.
LEADMALE:"If one isn't keeping me awake with her squealing, the other one is belching in my face.
SUPMALE:" You do that sometimes, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:After you've had a Denver omelette.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you know this is a real invasion of Rose's privacy.
LEADMALE:And it's a Spanish omelette.
OTHERFEMALE:Doesn't it bother you?
LEADMALE:Not if I take a little Gelusil.
SUPMALE:Oh, the diary.
LEADMALE:No! No! Not at all.
SUPMALE:And I'm really shocked that you read it.
LEADMALE:You're not interested to hear other things she had to say?
LEADFEMALE:Not in the slightest.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Well, fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Suit yourself.
SUPFEMALE:Use the knife.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, what are you doing? I thought we agreed we weren't gonna read any more.
SUPMALE:That was only because we couldn't pry the lock off again.
OTHERFEMALE:And then I remembered we had these pliers in the tool drawer.
LEADMALE:Gangway.
LEADMALE:Old people comin' through.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, what is all this stuff here? This isn't stuff.
LEADMALE:This is my life.
SUPFEMALE:Why are you bringin' your life into our livin' room? There have been robberies at Rocco's building.
SUPMALE:He asked me to store his valuables.
LEADMALE:We don't have enough space.
SUPFEMALE:I have plenty of space in my room.
LEADMALE:Come on, Rocco.
LEADFEMALE:When you go in there, I want you to leave the door open.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Cleaver.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, girls.
LEADMALE:Gee, what's my diary doing here next to a pair of pliers? Whatever it is you're thinkin', it isn't true.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Then George Bush isn't married to his mother.
SUPMALE:Boy, that was easier than I thought.
OTHERMALE:This lock has been tampered with.
SUPMALE:You two read my diary, didn't you?  That's despicable.
LEADFEMALE:I will tell you what is despicable, missy.
LEADFEMALE:Some of the things you wrote.
LEADFEMALE:This is my book for my eyes.
LEADFEMALE:You have no right to invade my privacy.
LEADMALE:Rose, you said some terrible things.
LEADMALE:I thought we were friends.
LEADMALE:We used to be.
LEADFEMALE:We're not anymore.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:What's wrong?
OTHERFEMALE:I have a problem.
LEADMALE:I'll say.
LEADFEMALE:You should never have stopped using that depilatory.
SUPMALE:Ma, I'm up here.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Ma, Rose isn't talking to me.
SUPMALE:Enjoy it while it lasts.
LEADFEMALE:Now, good night.
SUPFEMALE:Honey Hi, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Can I talk to you? No.
LEADMALE:Go away.
SUPFEMALE:But I can't sleep.
SUPFEMALE:It's because Rose isn't talkin' to me.
LEADFEMALE:I could care less.
LEADFEMALE:Get out.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Sophia? I'm not in.
SUPMALE:Wait for the beep.
SUPMALE:Then leave a message.
SUPFEMALE:Beep.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:This is Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:I Rose, shut up and get in here.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:I see you're with two double-crossing ex-friends.
SUPFEMALE:I'll come back later.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think this is, the 7-Eleven? I'm not open all night.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, we feel terrible.
LEADFEMALE:What have you done?
LEADFEMALE:We're really very sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry about what?
OTHERFEMALE:How can I ever trust you again?
LEADFEMALE:Trust who? Let's not talk about trust after the terrible things you wrote.
LEADMALE:Will someone please tell me?
LEADFEMALE:Blanche and I read Rose's diary.
LEADMALE:And she wrote some terrible things about us.
LEADFEMALE:About you? I didn't write anything about you.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't even know you when I kept that diary.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about? That was my 4-H diary.
SUPFEMALE:I kept it one summer when I raised two pigs for the county fair.
OTHERFEMALE:You kept a diary about raising two pigs? You know another way to get a 4-H pig diary badge? Oh, my God! There's been a terrible misunderstanding.
SUPFEMALE:What do you say we forget the whole thing? No way.
SUPFEMALE:I'm really mad.
LEADMALE:It's late, I'm tired, so listen up.
LEADFEMALE:You gonna tell us a story? No.
LEADFEMALE:Shadow puppets.
LEADMALE:See? An elephant eating a peanut.
SUPFEMALE:Happy? Of course I'm gonna tell a story.
LEADMALE:Picture 
LEADMALE:Morocco, the '30s.
LEADMALE:The 1930s? No, 30 degrees.
LEADMALE:Do I look like Willard Scott? Of course the 1930s.
LEADMALE:Three close friends are haggling over a Camel.
LEADMALE:How many humps? None! I'm talkin' about a cigarette.
OTHERFEMALE:It was the last one.
LEADFEMALE:Well, anyway What does this have to do with the diary? Suddenly I'm on Nightline.
SUPMALE:I was just tryin' to tell a story.
SUPMALE:There's no point, Sophia.
LEADMALE:I'll never be able to forgive them.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't there anything we can do? No.
LEADMALE:Absolutely not.
LEADMALE:I'm unyielding on this.
LEADFEMALE:Can't you think of anything that'll make us be friends? No.
SUPFEMALE:This time, you've crossed the line.
SUPMALE:If I can't trust you, then we can't be friends.
SUPFEMALE:The relationship is over.
SUPFEMALE:Good-bye.
OTHERFEMALE:I got out in the hall, and I missed you guys already.
LEADFEMALE:Please, let's be friends.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh, I love you guys.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:Now get out.
SUPMALE:Oh, let's not fight anymore.
LEADMALE:Fine! Get out! The best friends I've ever had.
LEADFEMALE:I said get out!  Look at all that money! Gosh, there's thousands.
LEADMALE:Where did this come from? Rocco's bag.
LEADFEMALE:Where did Rocco get all this money? I don't know, but the next time we go to the Colonel, I'm getting all white meat and a biscuit.
SUPMALE:I do not believe this.
SUPFEMALE:There are thousands here.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, how could Rocco have this much money? I'm as confused as you.
SUPMALE:He had that satchel when he went to the bank.
LEADMALE:Sophia, maybe you better tell us exactly what happened.
SUPMALE:When we got to the bank, he told me to keep the motor running.
LEADMALE:Five minutes later, he ran out.
LEADMALE:Did you think of asking why he was running? No.
SUPFEMALE:The man is taking diuretics for a prostate problem.
LEADFEMALE:His whole life is a 50-yard dash.
LEADMALE:Ma, he robbed a bank.
LEADFEMALE:I'm calling the police.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Wait.
SUPFEMALE:He didn't rob that bank.
LEADFEMALE:I know Rocco.
LEADFEMALE:He's a good man.
LEADFEMALE:A decent man.
LEADMALE:An honest man.
LEADMALE:And not a bad kisser.
LEADFEMALE:How do you explain this money? Are you a treasury agent? It's circumstantial evidence.
SUPMALE:Hello? Rocco, we were talking about you.
LEADFEMALE:A funny thing just happened.
LEADMALE:We found thousands of dollars in your bag, and we were kinda wondering where it came from.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, right.
OTHERFEMALE:That clears it all up.
LEADMALE:See you later, then.
SUPFEMALE:He robbed the bank.
OTHERFEMALE:Anybody hungry? You're not calling the police? The man told you he robbed a bank! He also told me he had a good reason.
SUPMALE:He did it for love.
LEADMALE:Gee.
OTHERMALE:The most any man ever did for me was getting all his sheep to lie down in a field and spell out my name.
LEADMALE:Ma, call the police.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Rocco needs to talk to me.
LEADFEMALE:He's coming over.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:I'll call the police.
SUPMALE:I'll never speak to you again.
LEADFEMALE:But, Sophia, Rocco did admit he robbed a bank.
LEADMALE:It's my fault.
LEADFEMALE:He thought he could keep me if he had money to buy me expensive things.
SUPMALE:I gotta convince him to turn himself in.
LEADFEMALE:If he doesn't, I'll go to the police myself.
OTHERFEMALE:It's the last time I let a man toy with my affections.
OTHERFEMALE:From now on, it's strictly physical.
LEADMALE:Well, I've never been fond of Rocco, but it's obvious that he really cares about my mother.
LEADMALE:Boy, one thing's for sure, that Rocco is a romantic, and there aren't many men like him left.
SUPMALE:Blanche, what was the most romantic thing a man ever did for you? Oh, that's easy.
SUPMALE:When George and I were courting and it was getting to the intimate stage, we went for a date in his big old Packard.
LEADFEMALE:Halfway home, we ran outta gas.
LEADMALE:It was dark, it was cold.
LEADMALE:So we held each other close.
SUPFEMALE:Both of us knew, right then and there, this was the night.
LEADMALE:Sure enough, pretty soon the windows were all fogged up from the heat generated by our bodies.
SUPMALE:After we were married, I told George that the only thing that could've made that evening more romantic was if we'd had candles and wine and a big blanket.
SUPMALE:So, on our tenth anniversary, George fired up the old Packard, and we drove along the same route, and we ran out of gas on exactly the same spot.
SUPFEMALE:George said, "Blanche, why don't you look behind that tree?" So I did, and there was a basket
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:With candles and wine and two long-stem glasses and a big blanket.
SUPFEMALE:We had a perfect evening.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, that is beautiful, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Isn't it a shame you didn't look behind the tree the first time? What's the most romantic thing a man did for you, Dorothy? Oh, well, the most romantic thing was when Stan proposed.
LEADMALE:He took me to a very expensive restaurant, and I went to the powder room, and when I returned, there was an open bottle of Dom Perignon and two filled glasses.
OTHERMALE:And we clinked the glasses in a toast, and Stan gave me a coy smile, and I winked at him, and then I just downed the champagne in one gulp.
LEADMALE:And it didn't go down smoothly.
LEADFEMALE:Later, Stan told me that he put my engagement ring in the bottom of the glass.
LEADFEMALE:Aw.
OTHERFEMALE:Aw.
LEADFEMALE:It turned up three days later.
LEADMALE:Where'd it turn up, Dorothy? On the Home Shopping Network, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:But, Dorothy, you have to admit, it was very touching what Rocco did for Sophia.
SUPMALE:If it hadn't been a felony.
SUPFEMALE:Still, it goes to show you, hair may turn gray, your skin may wrinkle, but you're never too old for romance.
LEADMALE:So, don't give up, girls.
LEADFEMALE:Ssst! Rocco.
LEADMALE:Sophia I came to get ya.
LEADMALE:Forget it.
SUPMALE:You kissed this pleasure palace good-bye when you stole that money.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:I've got a brand-new Harley-Davidson in the driveway.
SUPMALE:I didn't know you could ride a motorcycle.
LEADMALE:Can't.
LEADFEMALE:I pushed it all the way here from the dealership.
LEADMALE:I'm exhausted.
OTHERFEMALE:We're gonna have to take a cab.
OTHERFEMALE:Hold your horses.
LEADFEMALE:We got something to talk about.
LEADMALE:First, how did you rob that bank? Aahhh.
SUPMALE:It was a magnificent heist.
LEADFEMALE:I moved with catlike precision.
OTHERFEMALE:Rocco, you're in big trouble.
SUPMALE:By tomorrow, we'll be south of the border, sparkling skies above us, tropical breezes blowing across our bodies.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, you with me? No.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, I'm disappointed.
LEADFEMALE:Not half as disappointed as I am.
LEADFEMALE:I admit, at times, your stories about being a big-shot gangster seemed colorful to me, but I figured you weren't that guy anymore.
LEADMALE:And if you are, you're not for me.
OTHERFEMALE:I wish you'd have told me that before.
OTHERMALE:Sophia, I have some confessions to make to you.
OTHERMALE:I was never a big-shot gangster.
LEADFEMALE:I was never a big-shot nothin'.
LEADMALE:All I was was an assistant cook at chowder house in Bayonne, New Jersey.
OTHERMALE:Not the kind of fella you're used to goin' with.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't wanna lose ya.
LEADMALE:That's why I made up the bank robbery.
SUPFEMALE:$45,000 was my life savings.
LEADMALE:I thought with that money I could I could treat you like you oughta be treated.
LEADFEMALE:Like a queen.
SUPMALE:I can't believe this.
LEADMALE:I can't believe it either.
LEADMALE:There's a gate.
LEADFEMALE:I could've got a hernia comin' over the wall! Wait.
SUPFEMALE:I've messed everything up.
SUPFEMALE:I'll just get out of your life.
LEADMALE:What I can't believe is that you went through all this.
LEADMALE:Rocco, you always treat me like a queen.
LEADMALE:Come here.
SUPMALE:Okay, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:You landed on sports.
LEADMALE:Here's the question.
LEADFEMALE:"What famous football player wore panty hose" Doug Curloff, Tampa Bay Bucs, New Year's Eve.
OTHERMALE:We were at the Holiday Inn near the airport.
LEADMALE:The complete question is, "wore panty hose in a magazine advertisement?" How the hell would I know? To see a man in panty hose, I don't have to buy a magazine.
LEADMALE:Joe Namath.
LEADMALE:Your turn, Rose.
OTHERMALE:Okay, music history.
LEADMALE:Here goes.
LEADFEMALE:"What famous Mozart composition, "completed in 1787, is a serenade in G "for two violins, viola, cello, and double bass in four movements?" Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.
OTHERMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:How did you know that? They always play it during the chases on The Bugs Bunny-Roadrunner Show.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:There was There was this one where Elmer Fudd was chasing Bugs, and he stuck his gun down a hole that Bugs had painted Excuse me, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, could I see the rule book?
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Ah! What say we call it a night? Ready to go to bed, Dorothy? No.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna wait up for Ma.
LEADFEMALE:She's out with Rocco.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, Sophia'll be fine.
LEADFEMALE:She's a grown woman.
LEADMALE:You can't wait up every night.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:She's capable of taking care of herself.
SUPMALE:Hello? Ma! Do you know what time it is? You're what? Oh, the hell you are! Listen, you are not spending the night at Rocco's.
LEADMALE:Look.
SUPFEMALE:As long as you live under our roof, you will abide by our rules! I should do what to myself? What? Hello? Hel Dorothy, is Is your mother all right? Oh, fine.
LEADMALE:She does something wrong, suddenly she's my mother.
OTHERMALE:
LEADMALE:Who's the letter from, Ma?
OTHERMALE:Joanne Pescatore.
LEADMALE:She's coming to Miami for a visit.
LEADFEMALE:Joanne Pescatore? Didn't she own that candy store down the street in Brooklyn?
LEADMALE:That was Jeanette Passadano.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Then who was Joanne Pescatore? How the hell should I know? This letter's for Rose.
OTHERMALE:Ma, why are you reading Rose's mail? Because all you got were bills.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to this.
SUPMALE:Tell me if you think Joanne's a lesbian.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma.
SUPMALE:Hi, Sophia.
SUPMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Guess what I've got.
SUPFEMALE:A friend who's a lesbian? Better.
LEADFEMALE:I picked up our weekly lottery tickets.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, girls, it's been such a glorious day.
SUPFEMALE:All afternoon I was in the mood for leather and I finally found exactly what I wanted.
LEADMALE:Fine, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Just make sure his motorcycle doesn't block the driveway.
LEADFEMALE:Can we save the chat for later? If we hit the jackpot, I wanna live to spend it.
LEADMALE:What jackpot?
LEADMALE:I picked up our lottery tickets.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:I forget.
LEADFEMALE:How does this go again? To win something, you have to get three to match? Right.
SUPMALE:If you get three coconuts, you win $100.
LEADMALE:What if you get three palm trees? You don't have three palm trees.
LEADFEMALE:That means you win $10,000.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, I know what a palm tree looks like.
LEADMALE:You also know what a handsome doctor looks like.
SUPMALE:It doesn't mean you've got one.
LEADMALE:Sophia, she's right.
OTHERFEMALE:Three palm trees.
LEADMALE:$10,000.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:We just won $10,000.
LEADFEMALE:$10,000!
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe it!
LEADFEMALE:$10,000! Split four ways that's almost $ 2,000 apiece.
LEADMALE:Almost.
SUPMALE:Where are you going, Ma?
LEADFEMALE:To order that cherry red tricycle with the grocery bag sidecar.
LEADFEMALE:Don't laugh.
LEADMALE:You ride one past a shuffleboard court, you got old guys coming out of your hair.
LEADFEMALE:$10,000! God, life is beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Now I don't feel so guilty about spending all that money on this leather jacket.
LEADMALE:I don't mean to be a party pooper, but it looks like they sold you a jacket that someone returned.
LEADMALE:It's kind of beat-up.
SUPMALE:No, Rose, that's the way it's supposed to look.
LEADFEMALE:It's an aviator jacket.
LEADFEMALE:And now I can afford some accessories for it.
OTHERMALE:Like a purse?
OTHERMALE:Like an aviator.
LEADMALE:Here, let's just put that lucky ticket in my jacket pocket for safekeeping till tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:I think we ought to go out to dinner to celebrate.
LEADFEMALE:What a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go freshen up.
LEADMALE:Me too.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get my purse.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's everybody going?
LEADFEMALE:Dinner.
SUPFEMALE:Get ready.
SUPFEMALE:I am ready.
LEADFEMALE:I'm always ready.
LEADFEMALE:You do that at 82.
OTHERFEMALE:That, and carry hard candy.
LEADMALE:Hi, I'm Dave from Lincoln Hospital.
SUPFEMALE:That's nice.
OTHERMALE:If my blood pressure goes up, you'll be the first person I call.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait! I'm from the thriftshop.
LEADMALE:Somebody called about donating some old stuff.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, right.
OTHERFEMALE:These boxes over here.
LEADMALE:Oh, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:This beat-up old thing must be for you too.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:OK, let's celebrate.
OTHERMALE:We should order champagne.
SUPFEMALE:And caviar.
OTHERFEMALE:Yahoo! We're rich! It has to be here somewhere.
LEADMALE:It's not in the laundry room closet.
LEADMALE:It's not in my bedroom, but I knew that.
OTHERMALE:I am positive you left it on the couch.
SUPFEMALE:We gotta find that jacket.
LEADFEMALE:It's driving me crazy.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:I wasn't gonna say anything, but since it's kinda my fault, I'll pay for a new jacket.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean it's your fault?
SUPFEMALE:Do you know where the jacket is? What did you do with it, Ma? Stand back.
SUPMALE:I know how to use this thing.
LEADFEMALE:Spill it, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:I'm scared.
SUPMALE:I'll do anything you say.
LEADMALE:Where is the jacket, Ma?
LEADFEMALE:I gave it to the thriftshop.
SUPMALE:You what?
LEADMALE:Let's get down there before they sell it.
LEADMALE:What's the big deal? It was an old jacket.
SUPFEMALE:We put the winning lottery ticket in the pocket.
LEADMALE:Start the engine and open the door.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll jump in at the bottom of the driveway.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, excuse me, sir.
LEADMALE:We are looking for a leather jacket that got mixed up with a box of clothes we donated.
LEADFEMALE:It was a terrible mistake.
OTHERMALE:It was not a terrible mistake.
LEADFEMALE:It was a regular mistake.
SUPFEMALE:A terrible mistake is when you forget A Different World follows Cosby.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I remember you.
SUPMALE:I just picked that stuff up a couple of hours ago.
LEADFEMALE:Then it's still here?
SUPMALE:It must be.
LEADMALE:I just put it out.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Michael decided to take this.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, that's our jacket.
LEADMALE:Do something.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Rose.
LEADMALE:I left my flamethrower in my other purse.
LEADMALE:Here, let me handle this.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen here.
LEADFEMALE:I would like to have a word with you.
LEADFEMALE:I paid good money for that jacket and before you walk out of here with it, there's something I want to say.
LEADFEMALE:What? The zipper sticks a little.
LEADFEMALE:Pardon.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Would it be possible to try that jacket on? Just for a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, no time, ma'am.
LEADMALE:Michael has to get to the concert.
LEADMALE:Look, if you don't mind, I would like to see this Michael.
OTHERMALE:You and the rest of Miami.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:The entire engagement is sold out.
LEADMALE:Michael.
SUPMALE:Do you know who that is?
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:The guy from Pepsi commercials.
LEADFEMALE:Pepsi commercia Michael Oh, my God! That's Michael J.
LEADMALE:Fox!
SUPMALE:Please can we talk to you for a minute?
LEADFEMALE:Michael, it's very important.
SUPMALE:We won't bother you.
OTHERMALE:Michael! Yes, yes, that's right.
LEADFEMALE:It was a winning ticket, but we gave the jacket away.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I'll tell 'em.
SUPMALE:I'm sure they'll appreciate it.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:What did he say? He was in agreement.
LEADFEMALE:It was a miscarriage of justice and we deserve the money.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Great.
OTHERFEMALE:He also told me I'd called his Chinese restaurant instead of the Lottery Commission.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:He felt so bad, he's giving us free egg rolls the next time we come in.
SUPMALE:Oh, what's the difference? It's over.
LEADMALE:If we don't have the ticket, we can't claim the prize.
OTHERMALE:Sophia, are you all right? You haven't said a word in hours.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm fine.
LEADMALE:I was thinking about what I'd planned with my share of the winnings.
OTHERFEMALE:I wanted to get each one of you something special for being so kind and allowing a Ionely old woman to live with you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe if we went to a movie it'd make us feel better.
SUPFEMALE:Can we afford it?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, now.
SUPFEMALE:This is ridiculous.
SUPMALE:We are not poor.
OTHERMALE:We thought we had $10,000 and now we don't, but we're no better or worse off than we were 24 hours ago.
OTHERFEMALE:If that was a pep talk, it stunk.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this.
LEADMALE:There's a celebrity auction to benefit the homeless and they're selling a leather jacket worn by a major rock star at his concert last night.
SUPFEMALE:Let me see.
LEADFEMALE:What? Oh, I don't believe it.
SUPMALE:This is it.
OTHERFEMALE:This has to be it.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, let's get going.
LEADFEMALE:We can't go to a charity event like this.
LEADFEMALE:The auction started 20 minutes ago.
LEADFEMALE:I'm right behind you.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, those gifts I was talking about, they were more tokens of affection than actual gifts, you know? They're cheap? Just so everyone understands the ground rules.
OTHERFEMALE:OK, let's roll.
LEADMALE:The bid's 900.
LEADFEMALE:sold for $900.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations.
SUPMALE:And now, moving along to item number 17.
SUPFEMALE:A leather jacket recently worn in concert by one of the world's leading musical talents.
LEADMALE:Get ready.
SUPFEMALE:This is it.
LEADMALE:I have a really dumb question.
LEADMALE:And I have a box of Chiclets.
LEADMALE:What's your point?
SUPMALE:How high do we bid?
OTHERMALE:High.
OTHERFEMALE:High.
LEADMALE:I mean, even if it costs us $1,000, we'll still have $9,000 left.
LEADMALE:Don't start high.
OTHERMALE:We might get it for a couple of hundred.
LEADFEMALE:We'll start at $100 and see how it goes.
LEADMALE:OK, OK, OK.
LEADMALE:And now, may I have an opening bid, please?
LEADMALE:Excuse me?
SUPFEMALE:$10,000.
LEADMALE:sold for $10,000.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, sir.
OTHERMALE:Thank you so much.
LEADMALE:Could I say a few words to the audience? For ten grand they should let him shower with the audience.
SUPFEMALE:I guess now I'll never get to fly on the Concorde.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never get to buy that emerald pendant to dangle between my perky bosoms.
OTHERFEMALE:And I'll never get to buy perky bosoms.
LEADMALE:But what the hell.
LEADMALE:Nothing else perks on this body.
LEADMALE:Maybe we can get the jacket for a minute and grab the ticket out of the pocket.
SUPMALE:That's a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:I bet I could use a little friendly persuasion on that gentleman.
LEADFEMALE:Persuasion? This isn't dinner at the Rainbow Room, this is ten big ones.
LEADMALE:Give him whatever he wants.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:I guess I just didn't realize how much I wanted that money.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, I'm congressman Philip Starr and I've recently been accused of being insensitive to the homeless.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think tonight's sizeable cash contribution should lay those accusations to rest.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't even care about the jacket.
SUPFEMALE:It's a miracle.
LEADFEMALE:This is going to be easy.
LEADMALE:Well, don't take any chances.
LEADFEMALE:Sleep with him anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:And as a symbolic gesture to underscore my concern, I've done something very special tonight.
LEADFEMALE:In addition to my sizeable donation, I've just dispatched my top aide to one of many shelters in our community with the jacket I've just purchased.
LEADMALE:May it provide warmth and comfort to one of our city's homeless.
LEADFEMALE:We're screwed.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure we're in the right place?
SUPFEMALE:Mission Street Shelter for the homeless.
OTHERMALE:This is where they sent the jacket.
LEADMALE:Kinda drab, isn't it? Blanche, it's a shelter, not the flagship of the Hilton chain.
LEADFEMALE:Kinda reminds me of the Shady Pines Retirement Home, except here the lights in the exit sign work.
OTHERMALE:What's our plan?
LEADFEMALE:What is this? 
LEADMALE:Impossible? Do I look like Peter Graves? You could if you'd put a rinse in your hair and wear a lighter lipstick like I beg Here, I'll tell you what our plan is.
SUPMALE:Now, there's $10,000 at stake.
LEADFEMALE:To find that jacket and get that ticket we will lie, cheat, threaten and steal if we have t
LEADMALE:Oh, hello.
LEADMALE:Anybody got a backup plan? Sorry.
LEADMALE:I didn't know anyone was here.
SUPMALE:I was locking up.
LEADFEMALE:Father, we desperately need your help.
LEADFEMALE:Frankly, I'm not sure we have enough beds, but you're welcome to stay.
LEADMALE:Oh, we don't want to stay.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes, we do.
OTHERFEMALE:We have to, just for one night.
SUPFEMALE:There's no need to be embarrassed.
LEADMALE:We're not here to judge, we're here to keep you safe and warm.
LEADFEMALE:Let me get some pillows.
LEADMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:This is insane.
LEADMALE:I'm not leaving here without it.
LEADMALE:I'm with Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:We've come this far.
LEADFEMALE:After we get in, split up and look.
LEADFEMALE:Here are your pillows.
SUPMALE:The blankets are on the beds and lights out's in just a few minutes.
LEADFEMALE:The beds are right through here.
LEADMALE:Are you gonna tie a bow in that when you've finished wrapping it up? I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't mean to disturb you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a bit compulsive.
LEADMALE:It's the Minnesota farm girl in me.
SUPMALE:You're from Minnesota?
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:No kidding? So am I.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what a coincidence.
OTHERFEMALE:Isn't that amazing? St.
OTHERFEMALE:Olaf.
LEADMALE:Ben Wheaton.
LEADFEMALE:Pleased to meet you.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, my name is Rose Nylund.
SUPMALE:I come from St.
LEADMALE:Olaf.
LEADMALE:I should've known that you weren't a saint.
LEADFEMALE:It's too much to expect a miracle this late in the game.
LEADFEMALE:What happened?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, bedtime, Rose.
SUPMALE:Does that mean we can't talk anymore?
LEADMALE:No, they just like you to stay in your beds.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, darn.
LEADMALE:I didn't get to brush my teeth.
OTHERMALE:I know how you feel.
LEADMALE:I always make sure I brush after every meal.
SUPFEMALE:You wouldn't happen to have a meal on you, would you?
OTHERFEMALE:What are you staring at?
SUPFEMALE:Your purse.
SUPFEMALE:You just be careful, son.
SUPFEMALE:There is a long list of men who bear the scars of trying the wrong thing at the wrong time with me.
SUPMALE:Scars, I might add, that are not visible to the general public.
SUPMALE:I thought you might have a piece of gum.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I might.
SUPFEMALE:You want me to take a look? Forget it.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I didn't mean to snap at you like that.
LEADMALE:I'm just a little uncomfortable here.
OTHERFEMALE:Helps if you stuff newspapers under the mattress.
OTHERFEMALE:That's not what I meant.
OTHERMALE:I was talking about being here at the shelter.
LEADFEMALE:This is your first time? Oh, lord, it's been ages since I heard that from a man.
LEADMALE:Yes, it is my first time.
SUPFEMALE:I can give you a few pointers if you like.
LEADFEMALE:Now, that I've never heard before.
LEADFEMALE:Are you comfortable, Ma?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Before we leave, I wanna get the model number off this cot.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm hoping Ethan Allen makes one in knotty pine.
SUPMALE:Ma, try to make the best of it, OK? We're gonna be here for a while.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think Blanche or Rose spotted the jacket either.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe it.
LEADMALE:That's Ida Perkins.
OTHERMALE:What? That's Ida Perkins.
LEADMALE:What the hell is she doing here? Were you kidding me about being from Minnesota? Absolutely not.
OTHERFEMALE:I spent 22 years working the prime noon-to-eight shift at the Minneapolis Excelsior Hotel.
LEADMALE:I don't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:Where did you live in Minneapolis? Oh, 22 years, lots of places, but my last home was near Bartholomew and Third.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's a lovely neighborhood.
LEADFEMALE:Why did you leave? Well, I liked to entertain a lot, but the cardboard box I was living in was only suitable for small dinner parties.
SUPMALE:Breakfast is cereal and coffee.
SUPMALE:They ask for a quarter, but if you don't have it, no one makes a fuss.
LEADMALE:Just make sure you get there early.
SUPFEMALE:A lot of times they run out.
LEADMALE:Well, lovely as that sounds, Kenny, I usually skip breakfast.
OTHERMALE:When you're 45, you have to keep an eye on your figure, if you know what I mean.
LEADMALE:Blanche, who do you think you're fooling? Oh, all right.
LEADFEMALE:That's not what I mean.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing in this place? You don't belong here.
LEADMALE:I most certainly do.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, it's OK.
LEADMALE:I'm just curious.
SUPMALE:See, I don't belong here either.
SUPMALE:You don't?
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I'm in graduate school.
LEADMALE:I'm undercover, working on my doctorate in sociology.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it.
LEADMALE:The minute we started talking, I said to 
LEADFEMALE:"Now, how could a bright boy like him end up here?" You're more like my own son than you are like those people you see stopping strangers for spare change.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, that explains it all.
SUPFEMALE:Now I feel much better.
LEADFEMALE:So you're really a student working on your doctorate.
LEADMALE:I'm really an alcoholic who needs a place to sleep.
LEADMALE:What?
LEADFEMALE:It's true.
LEADMALE:I've already got my doctorate.
SUPMALE:We had some great times at the home, didn't we, Ida? We sure did.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, Ida was the best bar none at faking an angina attack at dinner so we could swap our nonfat yogurt for real sour cream.
LEADFEMALE:There wasn't a patient at Shady Pines that didn't bless Ida every time we sat down to eat a baked potato.
SUPFEMALE:When did you leave the home, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Perkins? Maybe a year now.
LEADMALE:I don't really keep track.
SUPMALE:Well, what made you decide to leave? Decide? Some things in life you never get to decide.
LEADMALE:Some things just happen.
LEADMALE:What happened, Ida? I didn't know
LEADMALE:nobody told me
LEADMALE:that it cost money to get old.
LEADFEMALE:I just figured that was one thing you'd get for free.
LEADFEMALE:It isn't.
LEADFEMALE:The home cost money, the doctors cost money, medicine costs money.
OTHERMALE:You know, I always thought it was sad I outlived my whole family, but I never knew it was going to be a punishment.
SUPFEMALE:The hotel business started to slump.
OTHERFEMALE:Hundreds of people got laid off.
OTHERFEMALE:I went looking for work, but believe it or not, most businesses aren't anxious to train a 55-year-old black hotel porter.
LEADFEMALE:Go figure it, huh? It's all about pressure from family, from professors, from friends.
OTHERMALE:No room to slide.
LEADMALE:Have to be perfect.
SUPMALE:Guess what, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I'm not perfect.
SUPMALE:So they sent me a letter.
LEADMALE:The money was gone.
LEADMALE:I asked for some help.
SUPMALE:They gave me some phone numbers.
LEADMALE:The streets were cold in Minnesota.
LEADFEMALE:It took me nearly three months, but I finally made it to Miami.
SUPFEMALE:I Will you listen to me, just running on? Tell you what, you tell me your sad story over breakfast.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:I couldn't survive out there, but I'm learning to survive here.
LEADFEMALE:Which reminds me, hold on to that purse.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't really want any gum.
OTHERMALE:I wander now.
LEADFEMALE:I don't decide anything anymore.
LEADFEMALE:I wait for things to happen.
SUPMALE:Look for the jacket.
LEADMALE:I guess.
LEADFEMALE:Let's split up.
SUPFEMALE:(# "Brother.
OTHERFEMALE:Can You Spare a Dime?" by E Y Harburg and Jay Gorney) # They used to tell me ? I was a building a dream ? With peace and glory ahead ? Why should I be standing in line ? Just waiting for bread? ? Once I built a rainbow ? Made it run # Made it race against time ? Once I built a railroad ? Now it's done # Brother.
LEADFEMALE:can you spare a dime? Ida, I know it's rough by yourself.
SUPMALE:I count my blessings that I have my Dorothy to look after me, but you can't give up.
LEADFEMALE:People care.
LEADMALE:They really do.
LEADMALE:Good people won't let this kind of suffering go on.
LEADMALE:You just gotta hang in there till tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Sophia, it is tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:I found it.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning.
LEADMALE:Here you go, Padre.
LEADMALE:Thanks for everything.
SUPFEMALE:Brother.
LEADMALE:can you spare a dime? 
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Hey! You're not even gonna ask what's wrong? What's wrong, Ma? I got three days to live.
SUPMALE:Fine, Ma.
LEADMALE:I'll scratch the Bengay off the grocery list.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you're so insensitive.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you are not dying.
OTHERMALE:I am, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I had a dream last night, a death dream.
LEADMALE:Your father spoke to me.
LEADFEMALE:Spoke to you? How? Do I look like Rich Little? Just listen.
LEADMALE:I'm sitting in the living room, and the clock strikes 9:00.
LEADMALE:Then the bell rings.
SUPMALE:It's your father in his fedora.
LEADFEMALE:He always wore a fedora on Saturday.
LEADMALE:He walks towards me, reaches out his hand and says, "Sophia, you can come now.
LEADFEMALE:There's room for you now.
SUPFEMALE:" That's it? You want him to show up with Barbara Eden and the college all-American football team? It's a dream, not a Bob Hope special.
OTHERMALE:I'm dying, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Saturday, 9:00.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't make any plans.
LEADMALE:Ma, you're being ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:When was the last Saturday night you had plans? Oh, thank you, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Those look lovely.
LEADMALE:So do you.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, you really got all dressed up for your brother.
LEADMALE:Well, we do come from the South.
LEADMALE:We always felt it was important to look absolutely great in front of company.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, girls.
SUPMALE:What time does Clayton get here? Oh, any minute now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we better put out the welcome mat.
SUPMALE:We don't have a welcome mat.
LEADFEMALE:What about the one Dorothy says is at the foot of your bed?  Oh, there's Clayton now.
LEADFEMALE:Remember what I said.
OTHERFEMALE:No remarks about his marriage breaking up.
LEADMALE:He's still a little touchy.
LEADMALE:Clayton! Baby brother! Sister! Oh, my, look at you all gussied up.
LEADMALE:Prettier than a spring-bloomin' peach tree on a dewy April morning.
OTHERMALE:Well, you oughtta talk, all fresh-scrubbed and rosy-cheeked like a country parson at a September hoedown.
LEADFEMALE:Why do I get the feeling they had a maid named Honeybee when they grew up?  Come on in, Clayton.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to meet my best friends Dorothy and Rose.
SUPMALE:Nice to meet you.
LEADMALE:It's a pleasure.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, so nice to see you.
LEADFEMALE:How was your trip, Clayton? Oh, fine.
LEADMALE:It just went by in no time.
SUPFEMALE:That usually means he met a stewardess he liked.
OTHERMALE:Blanche.
SUPMALE:Lunch, dinner or drinks? Dinner.
LEADFEMALE:I'm beginning to see the family resemblance.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, come on inside.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get you all settled down.
SUPMALE:Then I want to tell you all the wonderful things I have planned for us to do.
OTHERMALE:OK.
SUPMALE:It was so nice finally meeting you all.
LEADFEMALE:See you later, Clayton.
SUPMALE:Isn't it nice to see a brother and sister who are such good friends? It certainly is.
SUPMALE:Oh, I always wish that I could have been closer to my brother, Phil.
LEADMALE:You know, go places together, share experiences.
LEADFEMALE:Although I did love borrowing his clothes.
LEADMALE:Did you like wearing boys' clothes growing up? No, but fortunately neither did my brother Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, why are you sitting here in the dark? Conserving electricity for those who will still be living past Saturday.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma Put out your hands, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:What for? So I can say hello like Magic Johnson.
SUPMALE:So I'm gonna give you some of my personal things.
SUPFEMALE:My bank book, some stocks Oh, Ma, come on, now.
SUPFEMALE:This is crazy.
SUPMALE:Hi, y'all.
LEADMALE:Oh, fabulous.
LEADFEMALE:Roy and Dale are back.
LEADMALE:So, where are you two off to tonight? Oh, that's a surprise.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't that my silver locket in there? Nice getting to know you, gomer.
LEADFEMALE:See you around.
OTHERFEMALE:What's all this about a surprise? Oh, well, I've done a little matchmaking.
LEADMALE:Blanche, not again.
OTHERMALE:Yes, again.
LEADMALE:Now, you are 45 years old.
SUPFEMALE:You've been single almost two years.
OTHERMALE:Well, both Dorothy and I know how much fun the single life is.
LEADFEMALE:Many's the night Dorothy has sat here alone in this room watching me go out on dates.
SUPMALE:Sometimes I watch her go from the kitchen window.
LEADFEMALE:It's easier to bay at the moon.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't want you being afraid to get back on that horse and make a commitment again.
LEADFEMALE:Here's your horse pulling up now.
LEADMALE:Hello, Lois.
LEADMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:Clayton, remember Lois from the museum? Of course.
LEADMALE:So nice to see you again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's a pleasure.
LEADFEMALE:You two can get reacquainted on the way.
LEADMALE:These are your tickets for the concert in the park.
SUPMALE:It starts in 15 minutes, so you better hurry up, now.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Have a good time!  Good night! I was never any good at blind dating.
SUPMALE:I always felt so awkward.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, I have a surefire icebreaker I can teach you right now.
LEADMALE:Oh, once you learn this any man is putty in your hands.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Blanche, come on.
LEADFEMALE:That is ridiculous.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I'm certainly not gonna waste my time listening to this adolescent nonsense.
SUPFEMALE:Did you say putty? Ha ha ha ha.
SUPMALE:Sit back.
LEADMALE:Now, just play like we're at the movies.
LEADMALE:OK.
LEADFEMALE:First I start to yawn a little.
LEADFEMALE:Then I put my hands up over my head like this Oh, Blanche, I know that one.
LEADMALE:You end up with your arm around me.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but that's just the first part.
LEADMALE:Did you know that if you blow right on the tip of a man's earlobe, it can drive him absolutely crazy? I'll show you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna be dead in 24 hours.
LEADFEMALE:Couldn't you stay in the closet for one more day? Rose, what are you doing here? Clayton.
LEADMALE:It's my late night at the counseling center.
LEADFEMALE:But what are you doing here? Blanche told me she was sending you on a date.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, she did.
LEADMALE:Didn't it work out? Well, let's just say Blanche has it in her head what type is right for me, and she's way off.
OTHERMALE:I'll bet I could sit here for a minute and tell you what your type is.
LEADMALE:I'm good at this.
LEADMALE:Gosh, I'm stuck.
SUPMALE:You haven't even started.
SUPMALE:No, I'm stuck on the gum somebody left on this bench.
LEADMALE:OK, now, you just give me your honest reactions when people go by.
OTHERFEMALE:That's how I'll tell.
SUPMALE:OK.
OTHERFEMALE:Here comes one.
LEADMALE:Go.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Too thin.
SUPFEMALE:Here comes one.
LEADMALE:Too short? Next.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Clayton! Clayton, you're not playing fair.
LEADFEMALE:That's a man.
LEADMALE:That's a man and you're a man.
LEADMALE:You're both men.
LEADMALE:Clayton, you're that thing that everyone said Olga Larsen's nephew was 'cause he wore paisley clogs and gave out puff pastry on Halloween.
LEADFEMALE:I've been called a lot of things in my time, but that's a first for that one.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I'm gay, Rose.
LEADMALE:But Blanche told us you were married.
SUPFEMALE:I was.
LEADMALE:After a while I just couldn't deny the truth to myself.
LEADMALE:Seems silly still denying it to my big sister.
SUPFEMALE:Well, have you tried telling her? Every time I see her.
LEADMALE:And I always chicken out.
SUPFEMALE:Oh I know Blanche.
SUPMALE:I mean, she'd be upset, but not for long.
SUPMALE:And just think how it would help you two in the long run.
LEADMALE:But how do I keep from chickening out? By telling her.
LEADMALE:Tonight, while you've still got your dander up.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Did I say something embarrassing? No.
OTHERFEMALE:No, Rose.
SUPMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:You're absolutely right.
LEADFEMALE:I've got to tell her tonight.
LEADFEMALE:But it's not gonna be easy.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I still haven't told Blanche I was the one who stole the Montgomery Clift poster off her wall when she left for college.
LEADMALE:Ma, what are you doing up? Someone left the lock off my cage.
LEADMALE:I couldn't sleep.
LEADFEMALE:I was afraid I'd have that dream again.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you two doing up? Well, I'm waiting up for Clayton.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna make sure he had a good time tonight.
LEADFEMALE:My brother and I are very close.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's sweet, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:Evening, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Clayton Hollingsworth, it's about time.
LEADMALE:You and your date must have really hit it off.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing with Clayton? We ran into each other in the park.
SUPFEMALE:What happened to Lois? Oh, she went home.
LEADFEMALE:We weren't really suited, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Not suited? Clayton, sometimes I do not understand you.
LEADMALE:Time after time I fix you up with attractive, eligible women, and nothing happens.
SUPFEMALE:It's time you found yourself a woman.
LEADMALE:Now, what is the matter with you? Tell her, Clayton.
SUPMALE:I will, Rose.
LEADMALE:Tell me what? Well, I ran into Rose in the park, and And? And we had a long talk, and And? And we slept together tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, all that stuff I said about preparing for a burial, forget it.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:You finally came to your senses.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:I decided to be cremated instead.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Oh It's a great idea.
SUPMALE:My ashes can be divided among you, your brother, Phil, and your sister, Gloria.
LEADMALE:Nah, forget Gloria.
LEADMALE:I don't want to spread myself too thin.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, girls.
OTHERFEMALE:I need to talk.
SUPMALE:Oh, honey, what is it? All day long Blanche has been giving me looks.
LEADMALE:I think she's really mad at me.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Rose, what happened between you and Clayton last night is your business, not Blanche's.
SUPMALE:That's just the point, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Nothing happened between Clayton and me.
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing physical, anyway.
OTHERMALE:Well, why did Clayton say the two of you slept together if you hadn't? Because he's trying to hide something about himself from Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't even feel right saying it out loud.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe if I just whispered it.
LEADMALE:Clayton is a hobo? No, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Oh! Oh! Now, now I get it.
LEADMALE:Oh, good.
LEADMALE:I thought I was gonna have to draw you a picture.
LEADMALE:And I'm not sure I'd know how.
OTHERMALE:Hey! I don't get to know? No, Ma.
LEADMALE:OK, have it your way, but nobody can keep a secret from Sophia Petrillo.
LEADMALE:Whatever that guy's hiding, I could smoke it out of him in three or four quick questions.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, ladies.
SUPFEMALE:Perfect timing.
LEADMALE:Ma.
LEADMALE:So, Clayton, what do you think of this Miami weather so far? Oh, it's lovely.
OTHERFEMALE:I see.
LEADMALE:Have you ever been to Europe? No, but it's always been a dream of mine.
LEADMALE:Interesting.
LEADMALE:How many fingers am I holding up? Two.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:You can go back in the living room now.
LEADMALE:The man's as gay as a picnic basket.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, that that is That is incredible.
LEADFEMALE:How did you know? I heard him singing in the shower.
LEADMALE:He's the only man I ever knew who knows all the words to "Send In The Clowns.
LEADFEMALE:" Rose, I owe you an apology.
LEADMALE:You sure do.
LEADFEMALE:I shouldn't have got you mixed up in all this.
LEADMALE:It's just so hard to tell Blanche the truth.
LEADMALE:Clayton, you're selling your sister short.
LEADFEMALE:Now, at times, Blanche can be very understanding and compassionate and forgiving.
LEADFEMALE:Get away from my baby brother, you cradle-snatching, empty-headed, two-faced dummy.
SUPFEMALE:And then at other times she can be a real bitch.
LEADMALE:Blanche, there's something you should know.
OTHERFEMALE:Butt out, Clayton.
SUPMALE:This doesn't concern you.
LEADMALE:It most certainly does concern him.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Because he was seduced by a bubble-head whose hair looks like it was colorized by Ted Turner? Now, just a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Butt out, Clayton.
SUPMALE:This doesn't concern you.
SUPFEMALE:You're gonna regret this when you have to come begging on hands and knees for forgiveness.
LEADMALE:Oh? Then I shall never regret it, because I never intend to apologize.
SUPFEMALE:We'll see about that.
LEADMALE:I wish you hadn't done that, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hush up.
LEADFEMALE:It was for your own good.
OTHERFEMALE:There's something you just don't understand.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I understand perfectly.
LEADFEMALE:I pushed you into meeting all those women.
SUPMALE:That's why this happened.
SUPFEMALE:But it is over.
LEADMALE:Rose will be just fine.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, it's not as simple Oh, Clayton, honey, leave it alone.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, listen.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing happened between me and Rose.
SUPMALE:Just like nothing ever happens between me and any of the women you set me up with.
LEADMALE:There's a reason.
SUPMALE:What are you saying, Clayton? I'm saying I'm gay, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Clayton, please be serious.
OTHERFEMALE:You're just saying that so I won't set you up with any more women.
OTHERFEMALE:No, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, then you're saying it 'cause you're trying to get back at me for something.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche Clay, I know you too well for this.
LEADMALE:After all, I know it can't be true.
SUPMALE:You're my brother.
LEADFEMALE:It's true, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Maybe I ought to just leave you alone for a while.
LEADMALE:Clayton Hollingsworth.
SUPMALE:You look me in the face and tell me you really are what you just said you are.
LEADFEMALE:I think you heard me the first time, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Hey, Harry.
SUPMALE:Flip on the game, will you? Not another game.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Tina, let's go.
SUPFEMALE:I'll see you back at the house.
SUPMALE:Clayton.
LEADMALE:Blanche.
LEADMALE:How'd you find me here? Well, I knew that you and Rose were here last night.
LEADFEMALE:May I join you? Of course.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:You know what that popcorn reminds me of? Rex's Drive-In out at the lake.
OTHERMALE:You remember the night my date and I parked right next to you and your date? Pretty soon it got to be a contest who could fog up whose car the fastest.
LEADFEMALE:I think you won.
SUPFEMALE:You weren't doing too badly considering you were in a convertible.
OTHERMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:You know, Clay, I've been thinking a lot about what you told me today, and I've also been thinking a lot about that boy at Rex's Drive-In, and, honey, the two pictures don't go together.
LEADFEMALE:There's just something wrong with one of them.
SUPMALE:But it's not the one you're hoping, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:It was the heater fogging up my car windows that night.
OTHERMALE:So what can I bring you, sweetheart? Don't you dare talk to him like that.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you get out of here.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, I think he was talking to you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I'm having a little trouble putting this all together.
LEADFEMALE:Clayton, I just feel like I don't know you anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm the same person I always was.
LEADMALE:No, you're not.
LEADFEMALE:You used to be just like me.
LEADMALE:What? Great-looking? Yes.
LEADMALE:Charming? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Irresistible to men? My God, Clayton, you are me.
LEADMALE:But I still just can't Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:I spent a long time lying to myself.
SUPFEMALE:It felt a lot better when I stopped.
LEADMALE:It feels better being honest with you, too, and I'd hate to think that this is gonna keep us from being friends.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, honey, of course it isn't.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:I'll get used to this.
LEADFEMALE:I will.
LEADMALE:Well, look at me already.
SUPFEMALE:I'm practically comfortable seeing you here in a gay bar.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, this isn't a gay bar.
OTHERMALE:Clay, now, we did say we were gonna be honest with each other.
LEADMALE:All right, now, I can do my part.
LEADFEMALE:You just watch this.
SUPFEMALE:You all, over at the bar.
SUPFEMALE:I just want to say that I would be very proud to have any one of you date my brother.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd rather date you, lady.
LEADMALE:Sweet Jesus, I've just done the impossible.
OTHERMALE:I've converted one.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, get dressed.
LEADMALE:We're going out to celebrate Clayton's last night in town.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, terrific.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go to JosÃ©'s.
LEADMALE:We always go there to celebrate.
LEADFEMALE:The food is great.
SUPMALE:And they make all the waiters wear these really skintight bullfighters' pants.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Let's go to Amelio's.
OTHERMALE:T minus ten seconds, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma, will you give it up? You are not dying.
LEADFEMALE:Eight, seven, six There is not going to be a doorbell or a pop.
SUPMALE:five, four, three, two one.
LEADMALE:There is not going to be anything.
LEADMALE:You see? Ten seconds, nothing happened.
LEADMALE:Oh, God! Ma, stop.
OTHERMALE:Oh, suddenly somebody believes me.
OTHERMALE:Did I hear the bell? Listen, Rose, do me a favor.
OTHERMALE:Look out the peephole and see who's at the door.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, it's kinda hard to tell.
LEADFEMALE:All I can see is a fedora.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:Who's that at the door? It's me, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:The other side.
LEADMALE:Move, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, don't.
LEADFEMALE:I have to, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Ma! Mildred, what are you doing here? When do I always wear my lucky bowling hat? We're bowling tonight? Didn't you get my message the other night? No one answered the door.
LEADMALE:I figured you were napping, so I yelled outside your window we had room.
OTHERMALE:Wait Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Were your exact words, "Sophia, you can come now.
LEADMALE:We have room now"? And were you wearing that hat at the time? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Hasta luego, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going bowling.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let's go to dinner, ladies.
OTHERMALE:Have fun.
LEADMALE:Rose, honey.
LEADFEMALE:There's something I have to say to you.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just two little words, but they are the hardest two little words in all the whole world for me to say.
SUPMALE:"Not tonight"? No.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, if you've come here to apologize, I accept.
LEADFEMALE:Just like that? Yes.
LEADMALE:I mean, for me, just the fact that you thought of those words is plenty considering what a selfish, conceited person you are.
LEADMALE:But I had a whole speech planned, Rose a-about how nice you were to my brother and-and how proud I am to have such a sweet person as my friend.
LEADMALE:Now I can't say it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, sure you can.
LEADMALE:No, I can't.
SUPMALE:You just ruined it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm so sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I forgive you, Rose.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:He should have been here a half-hour ago.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, according to the rules of etiquette, you should never wait more than 20 minutes for a date.
SUPFEMALE:She's already waited six months for a date.
LEADMALE:What's another half-hour? I hate blind dates.
LEADMALE:You know, Ma, I never would have agreed to this if it wasn't your best friend Edna's good-looking doctor nephew.
OTHERMALE:Aw, he wasn't available anymore.
LEADMALE:He decided to buy a woman from the Philippines.
OTHERFEMALE:Actually, he bought two women.
SUPMALE:He wanted an extra for formal occasions.
LEADFEMALE:Then who is this guy? To tell you the truth, I was on the bus Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:You set Dorothy up with some guy you met on a bus? Please, it wasn't that glamorous.
LEADMALE:I saw a sign on the bus.
SUPFEMALE:It said, "Lonely? Can't make connections with that special person?" So I took $20 out of your purse, sent in a picture, they ran it through the computer and boom, you got a social life.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, I cannot believe you sent my picture in to a total stranger.
SUPMALE:I didn't send in your picture, I sent the picture that came with my wallet.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, I am furious with you.
LEADFEMALE:Think how mad your date's gonna be when he finds out he's not going out with Janet Gaynor.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, God! Dorothy, just remember how important first impressions are, honey.
LEADMALE:Stand up straight.
SUPFEMALE:Put your left hand on your hip.
LEADFEMALE:Now, strike a very sexy, sultry pose.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:What's wrong with your hip? I was hoping you'd be my date, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, gee, I'm busy tonight.
OTHERMALE:But maybe you could try me again next week.
LEADMALE:What's in the box, Rose? Brochures for the "Be a Pal" program.
SUPFEMALE:I'm mailing them out.
LEADFEMALE:How does that work? Well, you just put 'em in an envelope and you stick a stamp on them.
SUPFEMALE:Not that, you idiot.
SUPMALE:Oh, the "Be a Pal" program? Well, each week, you get a motherless girl and be her pal.
LEADMALE:Help her with her homework and take her to movies and have dinner together.
SUPMALE:That's very interesting.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I could get involved with that.
OTHERMALE:You, Blanche? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Why, nothing would be more satisfying than to be of loving service to a lonely, motherless child.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, I'll have to see pictures of the father before I commit.
LEADFEMALE:If you're interested, I could call and see about sending over two girls.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Count me in.
LEADMALE:Hi, I'm Eddie.
LEADFEMALE:It took a computer to come up with this? I'm Dorothy.
LEADMALE:These are my friends, Blanche and Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, there.
LEADMALE:How do you do? Eddie, I hope you're not too terribly disappointed.
LEADFEMALE:My mother wasn't exactly honest in sending in that picture.
LEADMALE:I knew that.
LEADFEMALE:I have quite a few Janet Gaynors in frames around my house.
SUPFEMALE:Believe me, when you've been in a deep depression for a year and a half, nothing fazes you.
SUPFEMALE:Well Eddie, what wonderful things have you got planned for tonight? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I was gonna cancel, but my therapist wouldn't let me.
SUPMALE:Perhaps if we spoke to him together? I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I'm still not really recovered.
LEADMALE:You see, after 25 years of marriage, my wife Roberta sent me a Dear John letter.
SUPFEMALE:That's terrible.
LEADFEMALE:Married 25 years and she doesn't know your name is Eddie? Well, I guess I have to feed you.
LEADMALE:Let's go look for a place to eat, Roberta.
LEADMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Her name's Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Your ex-wife is Roberta.
SUPMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Rub my nose in it.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:You're up early.
SUPMALE:I'm making a list of things to do with our little pals.
SUPFEMALE:I just hope I'm good at it.
LEADFEMALE:With all that enthusiasm, I'm sure you will be.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanna make a difference in the lives of these youngsters.
SUPMALE:I wanna teach 'em, I wanna mold 'em.
SUPMALE:I wanna become a positive influence on every aspect of their young lives.
LEADMALE:It is only one afternoon a week, isn't it? Dorothy Zbornak, are you just getting in? No, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I got up early and went jogging in a park with a really strict dress code.
SUPFEMALE:Now, if you'll excuse me, I need some coffee.
SUPFEMALE:What's the number of the police station? Is anything wrong? No, I just wanna find out where I can buy the best donuts.
OTHERMALE:Of course something is wrong! Dorothy never came home.
LEADMALE:Yes, she did.
LEADMALE:She's in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:All right, spill it.
OTHERFEMALE:I want details.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, so do I.
SUPMALE:Oh, me too.
LEADMALE:Well, there is not much to tell.
LEADMALE:Eddie took me to the restaurant where he had met his ex-wife Roberta.
SUPMALE:I would think going there would just remind him of her.
SUPFEMALE:It did.
LEADMALE:Especially since she owns it, runs it and calls the place Roberta's.
SUPMALE:As she was seating us, he begged her to come back to him.
LEADMALE:And after he had wept over his crab cakes, I begged her to come back to him.
SUPFEMALE:I guess you're not gonna see him again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:Yes, I will.
SUPFEMALE:What? Listen, pussycat, it's been a long time since you've been out on a date.
SUPMALE:And it's quite possible you can no longer judge a good one from a bad one.
OTHERFEMALE:So let me be of help.
LEADFEMALE:Bad date, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:Bad, bad date.
SUPMALE:What did you do the rest of the night? I tried to comfort him.
LEADMALE:I must have lost track of time 'cause next thing I knew it was morning.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I better get some rest.
LEADMALE:We're meeting for lunch.
LEADMALE:I don't get it.
LEADFEMALE:They don't seem to have anything in common.
SUPFEMALE:I guess it's just like that old 
LEADFEMALE:opposites attract.
SUPFEMALE:That's very true.
LEADMALE:Back in St.
SUPMALE:Olaf Ollie Canudenspringle and his wife Bridget were opposites in every way.
LEADMALE:I mean, he was fat, she was thin.
SUPMALE:He was neat, she was sloppy.
LEADMALE:He was tall, she was short.
SUPMALE:He was cheap, she was extravagant.
LEADFEMALE:He was Opposites.
SUPMALE:We get the picture.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, I'll never forget the time they sang at our annual talent show, right after the herring juggling act.
LEADMALE:You mean to tell me that somebody actually juggled herring? No.
OTHERMALE:It was the herring who did the juggling.
LEADMALE:Tiny little Ginsu knives.
SUPMALE:Really very dangerous.
LEADMALE:I mean, one false move, they could have filleted themselves.
SUPMALE:I hate you.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway  Oh, good.
LEADMALE:Here they are.
SUPMALE:Come in, girls.
SUPMALE:I'm Marla, this is Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:We're from the "Be a Pal" program.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, and I'm Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I just knew when I heard your voice on the phone that you'd be pretty.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, thank you.
LEADMALE:Rose, this is my little pal Jackie.
LEADMALE:And your little pal Marla.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Marla.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, sit down.
LEADMALE:Now, is there anything special you girls feel like doing today? Would it be too much to see a movie? Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:We can go see Oliver & Company or Roger Rabbit.
OTHERMALE:Or Tequila Sunrise.
SUPMALE:I hear Mel Gibson takes his shirt off a lot.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Jackie, I think you and I are gonna get along just fine.
SUPMALE:Well, just let me freshen my makeup.
LEADMALE:Girls, why don't you come with me and I'll show you how I transform myself into a fresh-faced, innocent, young thing? Could you skip the "innocent" part, Blanche? The show starts in two hours.
LEADMALE:Hi, Rose.
SUPMALE:Blanche around? She's showing the girls some makeup tricks before we go to the movies.
LEADMALE:Anything I can do? No, thanks.
LEADMALE:I need to talk to somebody.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I get it.
LEADMALE:You have a problem and you don't think I'm sophisticated or worldly enough to help.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:You got a minute? Sure, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:It's about Eddie.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I've been seeing him for a week now.
LEADFEMALE:I'm having a relationship with him like I've never had with a man before in my life.
OTHERFEMALE:It is purely physical.
LEADFEMALE:Eddie is the greatest lover I have ever had.
SUPMALE:Come on, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:If we're gonna do this, you have to tell me the truth.
LEADMALE:No, I am telling you the truth.
SUPMALE:Honey, there is more to Eddie than meets the eye.
LEADMALE:But the only thing we have in common is under the sheets.
LEADMALE:What's under the sheets? His cappuccino maker.
LEADMALE:Sex, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I am talking sex.
SUPFEMALE:We don't go to dinner, we don't go to the movies, we just go to bed and it is terrific.
LEADFEMALE:All that and cappuccino too? Well, what's the problem? Did I say there was a problem? You wanted to talk about it.
SUPMALE:Can't one have a discussion without there being a problem? I thought maybe you were feeling guilty.
LEADMALE:Guilty? I have nothing to feel guilty about.
LEADMALE:I am having the time of my life.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanted to, you know, say it out loud.
LEADFEMALE:But, listen, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't mention this to anybody.
LEADFEMALE:It's a thing that most people probably wouldn't understand.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Rose Nylund can keep a secret.
LEADMALE:Do you know what the name Nylund means in Norwegian? No.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm not telling you.
LEADMALE:How do I look? Great, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:You going out with Eddie? Yes.
OTHERMALE:Oh, by the way, Blanche, I borrowed your gold earrings, if that's OK? Oh, it's fine, but I do think I should caution you
LEADMALE:they were meant for petite ears.
LEADMALE:They'll just have to do until Disney unveils their Dumbo line.
LEADMALE:I'd better grab something to eat before Eddie gets here.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just go out to eat? There never seems to be enough time.
LEADFEMALE:You know, there's something rotten in the state of Denmark.
SUPMALE:It's their cheese.
LEADFEMALE:They refuse to use preservatives.
OTHERMALE:I mean between Dorothy and Eddie.
SUPFEMALE:There is something peculiar in that relationship.
OTHERFEMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:And I'm gonna find out what it is or my name isn't Sophia Sophia Sophia Petrillo.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:Maybe the doctor is right.
LEADMALE:Maybe I do need all three pills a day.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy will never tell her.
LEADMALE:Tell her what? The secret that I don't know.
SUPMALE:Rose.
SUPFEMALE:There's something you know that you're not telling me.
LEADFEMALE:You can ask me all the questions you want, you'll never break me.
SUPFEMALE:So you're not in love with this Eddie guy? Oh, no, Ma.
LEADMALE:Then why are you spending all your time with him? Eddie's a love machine? I'm sorry, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I held out as long as I could.
LEADMALE:She said she'd tickle me.
SUPFEMALE:You're a regular Nelson Mandela, Rose.
SUPMALE:So that's it? Lust.
LEADMALE:Look, Ma, I am a grown woman and I have needs.
LEADMALE:Needs? You need food.
SUPFEMALE:You need air.
OTHERMALE:You need a better wrinkle cream.
LEADMALE:You don't need sport nookie.
LEADMALE:This is wrong for you.
LEADMALE:Wrong for me? This is why I didn't tell you about this in the first place.
OTHERMALE:You are always criticizing me, you are always judging me, you are always telling me what to do.
LEADMALE:This time I'm going to do what feels right for me, and there's nothing you can say that'll make me feel guilty about it.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I wish I'd married Bing Crosby when I had the chance.
LEADMALE:Why? Because he was such a strict disciplinarian? No, because now I'd be a wealthy widow with my own place in Pebble Beach, so I wouldn't have to listen to that crap.
OTHERMALE:I just haven't found a thing today.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't look right in American clothes.
SUPMALE:I have a more European body.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, in Europe, do they all have big butts too? Hi, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Where on earth have you girls been? We were helping elderly people get a good grip on the escalator.
SUPMALE:We just lost all track of time.
SUPMALE:How sweet.
OTHERFEMALE:Isn't that sweet? Can you guys hold our bags? We wanna go toss a few pennies in the fountain.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna make a wish that we stay pals forever.
LEADMALE:Oh, sweetie.
LEADMALE:We'll see you in the car.
SUPFEMALE:OK, bye.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't they the greatest? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Looks like I've been a good influence on them.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, ladies.
SUPFEMALE:I need to inspect your bag.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you were both asleep.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you just getting in? Because the justice system in America is an imperfect and sluggish piece of antiquated machinery.
OTHERMALE:What? We were in the slammer.
LEADFEMALE:Our cute little "pals" stole some merchandise and made us the fall guys.
LEADFEMALE:We have to appear in court at noon tomorrow.
LEADMALE:And where were you? We were calling all night.
LEADMALE:I was out with Eddie.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, I just got home myself.
LEADMALE:I wonder why Sophia didn't answer.
SUPMALE:She probably thought it was me calling and decided not to answer.
SUPMALE:It's a little guilt trick she's used on me ever since I was 15.
SUPMALE:That and having major surgery and telling me about it two days later.
SUPMALE:Sometimes she didn't even need the surgery.
LEADMALE:That's guilt.
SUPMALE:Well, the days of my mother making me feel guilty are over.
LEADFEMALE:There is nothing wrong with my relationship with Eddie, and if my mother can't buy it, I'm very sorry, it is her problem.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, just getting in? Listen, if you three are just gonna use this place days, would you mind if I got one of those medical emergency beepers? I'd feel terrible if one morning you found me on the doorstep instead of the Miami Herald.
LEADMALE:Ma, it's not gonna work.
SUPFEMALE:I do not feel guilty about staying out all night and I do not feel guilty about Eddie.
LEADMALE:Don't underestimate me.
OTHERMALE:I could make you feel guilty about bombing Pearl Harbor if I wanted.
SUPFEMALE:The point is, I don't want you to feel guilty.
LEADMALE:There's nothing wrong with a physical relationship.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, what about what you said last night? If you had let me finish my thought, Colonel Gaddafi, you might have understood.
SUPFEMALE:I said I thought this kind of relationship was wrong for you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's not.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, I'm your mother.
LEADFEMALE:I know you.
SUPFEMALE:You're a loving and sensitive person.
LEADFEMALE:But this isn't gonna be enough someday.
LEADFEMALE:You'll be bored and dissatisfied and you'll end up unhappy.
LEADMALE:I'd hate to see that happen to you, pussycat.
SUPFEMALE:But if you think you can handle that, just look me straight in the eye and I'll drop the whole thing.
LEADFEMALE:Ma I can handle that.
OTHERFEMALE:Both eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma, I hate it when you're right, and I guess I knew you were right all along.
LEADMALE:What are you gonna do, Dorothy? Well, I'll have to have a talk with Eddie.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, it is obvious that this relationship has to taper off.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I'll end it.
SUPMALE:Girls, I know you're gonna go to court and tell the truth.
SUPFEMALE:We'd like to, but we could get in some trouble.
OTHERFEMALE:You see, most of the judges at juvenile court know us.
LEADMALE:I think we've worn out our cute act.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you listen to me, you little monsters.
LEADFEMALE:If you think we'll be your patsies, you've have another thing coming.
LEADMALE:Maybe some cookies and milk'd change your mind.
LEADFEMALE:Here, how about $50 and you tell the truth.
LEADMALE:What do you say? Are you trying to bribe us? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:You catch on quick.
LEADMALE:Make it 150 each.
LEADMALE:Oh, you little pirates.
LEADMALE:All right, you've got it.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, get out of here.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:Oh, beat it! I can't believe you did that.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:That check was written on our vacation account that we closed last week.
SUPMALE:The bank would sooner cash a check from Jim and Tammy Bakker.
LEADFEMALE:Where are the girls? Oh, they had a sudden change of heart.
LEADMALE:They decided to confess.
LEADMALE:Oh, God, that's Eddie.
SUPMALE:I don't know if I can go through with this.
OTHERMALE:Don't worry.
SUPMALE:We're both right beside you to help you through it.
LEADFEMALE:It's not that easy.
LEADMALE:Eddie has some kind of a strange hold over me.
LEADFEMALE:Baloney.
SUPFEMALE:Eddie is just a man, cut from the same cloth as the many men who have dumped you over the years.
LEADFEMALE:Just think of him as all those men, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Become the dumper before you become the dumpee.
SUPFEMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna get rid of him just the way Paul Bennington got rid of me.
OTHERFEMALE:The way Steve Mendlebaum got rid of me.
SUPMALE:The way Tom We'll be here all afternoon.
SUPFEMALE:Can you just open the door? Blanche is right.
LEADMALE:The man is history.
LEADMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Eddie, I want you so bad.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I can't help it.
OTHERFEMALE:He looks so cute in that little suit.
LEADMALE:Is something wrong, Dorothy? Yes, there is something wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:Eddie, we have Eddie, stop doing that with your lip.
LEADFEMALE:Doing what? That sexy, quivering thing in the corner of your mouth.
OTHERFEMALE:I was just trying to loosen up a poppy seed caught in my teeth with my tongue.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's driving me crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy! Come here, Eddie.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down here.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, what Dorothy is trying to tell you What's that cologne you're wearing? I'm not wearing cologne.
SUPFEMALE:But that's impossible.
LEADFEMALE:It smells kind of like a mixture of Old Spice and musk and And a porterhouse steak? Yes.
LEADMALE:That's me.
LEADMALE:The smell really gets intense when I sweat.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Well, I'd be curious to find out just how Blanche! Blanche! Now, look here, Eddie.
OTHERMALE:Now, you listen to me.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy has decided she wants nothing more to do with you.
LEADFEMALE:I can't understand why because I think you have about the cutest ears I've ever seen on a man in my entire life.
LEADFEMALE:They make you kind of look like Bambi.
LEADFEMALE:Marry me, Eddie.
OTHERFEMALE:Ladies, ladies, please! This always happens.
SUPFEMALE:I'm cursed.
SUPFEMALE:Ever since I was a little kid, I've been absolutely irresistible to women.
SUPMALE:I know I'm a little plain to look at No, you're not plain at all.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're adorable.
OTHERMALE:Cute as a button.
LEADMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:Please, let me finish.
LEADMALE:I know I'm plain to look at, but everything I do seems to drive the opposite sex crazy.
SUPMALE:I don't do it on purpose.
OTHERMALE:It just happens.
LEADFEMALE:The way I look at a woman.
LEADMALE:The way I make love to a woman.
LEADFEMALE:The way I kiss a woman.
SUPFEMALE:The way I make love to a woman.
SUPFEMALE:You said "make love" twice.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:It's my favorite.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not surprised you wanted to dump me tonight
OTHERMALE:the good ones always do.
LEADFEMALE:They always end up wanting more than just nights filled with unbridled ecstasy.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing tomorrow night? I'd better get going.
LEADFEMALE:I've caused enough trouble.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Eddie, can't we see each other occasionally, just as friends? It won't work.
SUPFEMALE:It's like trying to eat one potato chip.
LEADMALE:Au revoir.
LEADMALE:Oh, hello, Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Eddie.
LEADFEMALE:Eddie, I never noticed that beauty mark on your neck.
LEADFEMALE:What beauty mark? That one! Sophia! Sophia! 
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Hi, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Girls, you are my very best friends in the entire world, and I trust and respect you more than any people I know.
LEADFEMALE:So I want you to tell me the truth.
LEADFEMALE:Now, honestly, do you think I'm competent at what I do? Based on the sounds from your bedroom, I'd bet you're damn near spectacular.
OTHERFEMALE:I am talking about my job at the museum.
LEADFEMALE:Of course you're competent.
SUPMALE:They wouldn't have kept you for five years if you weren't.
LEADFEMALE:Then why is my boss constantly looking over my shoulder? I would guess a plunging neckline and a push-up bra.
LEADMALE:I swear, sometimes I think I just wanna throw in the towel and take an early retirement.
OTHERFEMALE:I wonder if you can collect Social Security at 49, 50.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche
LEADFEMALE:the address of the Social Security building? Come on now.
OTHERMALE:You had a bad day at work.
LEADMALE:Happens to all of us, but we're not retiring.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't know what I'd do if I retired.
SUPFEMALE:No problems to solve, no challenges.
LEADMALE:I'd be afraid my mind would go soft.
LEADFEMALE:Don't even talk that way, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:That's crazy talk.
LEADFEMALE:It sure would be nice to have some investments to fall back on, though.
SUPFEMALE:I just never had a mind for that.
OTHERMALE:Me neither.
SUPFEMALE:I never had a mind for money matters.
LEADMALE:I always used to let Stanley handle all our investments.
LEADFEMALE:Did he have a head for numbers? Stanley? The man used to have to get naked to count to 21.
SUPMALE:Little more.
SUPMALE:Another one.
OTHERMALE:Now, if you ask me, we are doing fine, starting out slow, you know, going in on that certificate of deposit together.
LEADFEMALE:It's the simplest form of investment.
SUPFEMALE:An idiot couldn't screw it up.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, Rose, what was the rate today for the CD at the bank? I didn't go to the bank today.
LEADFEMALE:I was called to work early, so I asked Sophia to go for us.
SUPMALE:You let Ma leave the house with $3,000 of our money? What's wrong with that? What's wrong?! Odds are she'll probably come back with a handful of magic beans! Dorothy, just relax.
SUPFEMALE:Your mother is a responsible woman.
LEADFEMALE:She knows how long it took us to save that money.
LEADMALE:You can trust her.
LEADFEMALE:Don't get mad.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, did you buy the CD today? Not exactly.
LEADMALE:I said, don't get mad.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, what did you do with our money? I think you're gonna be really impressed.
LEADFEMALE:I made a very shrewd deal with a guy I met at the bus stop.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Now, I know it's a big responsibility to take care of one, but I bought a boxer.
LEADMALE:You spent $3,000 for a dog? He's no dog.
SUPMALE:He's a winner.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in, Pepe.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you bought a prizefighter? It's a once-in-a-lifetime investment.
LEADMALE:A week from now, you're gonna be kissing the ground I walk on.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna be looking up at it from the other side.
LEADMALE:What happens a week from tonight? Pepe, tell them.
LEADMALE:Â¿QuÃ©? Pepe, boom-boom.
SUPMALE:Kill Gonzales! Attaboy, tiger.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Pepe, why don't you do some roadwork while we talk? Â¿QuÃ©? Immigration, Pepe.
SUPFEMALE:Immigration.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody has to worry about anything.
SUPMALE:This is the chance of a lifetime.
OTHERFEMALE:Even if Pepe loses next week's fight, he still gets $10,000.
LEADFEMALE:How is that possible? It's a guaranteed purse.
SUPFEMALE:And for our lousy 3-grand investment, that's a $7,000 profit.
SUPMALE:Pepe gets the standard 20%, and we're left with a tidy sum for only one week's work.
LEADMALE:So 20% is standard for a boxer? It is if he doesn't speak English.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, that's it.
SUPMALE:Forget it.
LEADFEMALE:Take him back.
OTHERMALE:To where, Customer Service? Besides, I believe there's a no-return clause on fighters.
SUPFEMALE:Unless you're Robin Givens.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, this isn't making any sense.
LEADFEMALE:It's all legit.
LEADFEMALE:I checked it out.
SUPFEMALE:If you don't mind, we're gonna make a few phone calls in the morning to try to find out what this is all about.
LEADMALE:The whole thing is ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:In the meantime, I'll bunk with you.
LEADFEMALE:I told Pepe he could have my room.
SUPFEMALE:He's staying here with us? Hey, we're in training.
LEADFEMALE:And set another place at the table.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Pepe.
SUPFEMALE:Pepe, you like ravioli? Â¿QuÃ©? Boom-boom.
OTHERMALE:Kill Gonzales!  Yeah, his name is Kid Pepe.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
SUPFEMALE:He's supposed to have a fight next week.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I'll hold.
LEADMALE:OK, Kid, there are three things you have to remember in the ring.
LEADMALE:One
OTHERMALE:keep your face covered, two
OTHERMALE:keep your head down and three
LEADMALE:keep moving at all times.
LEADFEMALE:Incidentally, the same rules apply if you're ever dining at a clam bar in Little Italy.
OTHERMALE:Ma, will you turn that down? I can't hear.
SUPMALE:Uh, yes, yes.
SUPMALE:Yes, I'm still here, yes.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:So the contract is valid? Well, thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you very much.
SUPFEMALE:Everything is on the up and up.
SUPFEMALE:He does have a fight scheduled.
LEADFEMALE:All we have to do is hire a cut man, but I can probably do that on my way back from the dry cleaner's.
LEADMALE:Gee, it sounds so natural, doesn't it? Then I guess till next Tuesday, we are Kid Pepe's managers.
OTHERFEMALE:What happens after Tuesday? We take our winnings and buy a heavyweight.
SUPFEMALE:OK.
LEADMALE:A middleweight and a microwave.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, forget it.
LEADMALE:This insanity lasts exactly one week, and that's only because we have a chance of possibly getting our savings back.
OTHERFEMALE:The minute the fight is over, it is "Adios, Pepe.
LEADFEMALE:" No! No, no, Pepe! Get back here and boom-boom.
OTHERFEMALE:Wouldn't it be something, though, to make $7,000 in 7 days? It sure would.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, girls, remember what we're dealing with.
LEADFEMALE:My mother bought this man at a bus stop.
LEADFEMALE:Jab.
LEADMALE:Left.
OTHERMALE:Jab, jab, left.
OTHERMALE:Ma, you don't know the first thing about boxing.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:I used to be known as the Don King of Sicily.
OTHERMALE:Of course, I used to wear my hair differently then.
LEADMALE:I might be able to help Pepe, too.
LEADFEMALE:You can be a constant reminder of what might happen if you spar without headgear.
LEADFEMALE:I mean I might be able to help him with this.
SUPMALE:A, my name is Anne, and my husband's name is Alf.
LEADFEMALE:We come from Anhoev, and we sell antlers.
LEADMALE:This is ridiculous.
SUPMALE:The important thing is that we get our money back.
LEADMALE:What difference does it make if Pepe wins? Ten grand.
LEADMALE:Say what? Ten grand.
LEADMALE:If Pepe wins, the money's doubled.
OTHERFEMALE:Didn't I mention that? Hands up, Pepe.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, get the music.
SUPMALE:Pussycat, get some sleep.
SUPMALE:The big fight's tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:Words that have echoed from mother to daughter since time began.
SUPMALE:OK, so I don't turn a phrase like Harriet Nelson.
SUPMALE:You still better get some sleep.
LEADFEMALE:I can't, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:I'm too nervous.
LEADMALE:About the money? No, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:I'm always a wreck the night before any welterweight Division B match-up at the local arena.
SUPMALE:Of course I'm worried about
SUPFEMALE:Ma, how could you do this? How could you gamble with our money? Let me tell you a story, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Picture it
LEADFEMALE:Sicily, 1920.
LEADFEMALE:Two young girls pack their bags and leave their tiny village to seek fame and fortune and a meal cooked without oregano.
LEADFEMALE:Their journey takes them to a seaside town where a ship prepares to depart for the New World.
SUPMALE:They're just
OTHERMALE:The New World? Anybody can say Baltimore.
LEADFEMALE:There's an art to telling these stories.
SUPMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:Where was I? Departing for the New World.
LEADMALE:Oh, right.
SUPMALE:Anyway, the price of steerage turns out to be 900,000 lire.
LEADFEMALE:Or approximately a buck and a quarter.
LEADMALE:Which is exactly the amount of each girl's life savings.
LEADMALE:Exactly? That's why this is a story instead of an immigration report.
LEADMALE:May I continue? One girl chooses to spend her money and take a chance on adventure.
OTHERFEMALE:The other plays it cautiously and books only a ferry to Sardinia, saving the rest of her money for a rainy day.
LEADMALE:Lemme guess, Ma.
OTHERMALE:You were the one who chose adventure.
OTHERFEMALE:You also would've said Baltimore instead of the New World.
LEADFEMALE:You're no good at this.
SUPFEMALE:I'm the girl who played it safe.
LEADMALE:Maybe if I'd made the other choice, I'd have been prime minister of Israel instead of my good friend Golda Meir.
OTHERMALE:Ma, you never met Golda Meir! Please! I almost married her husband, the man who perfected the hot dog.
LEADFEMALE:Oscar Meir.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you're not making any sense.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Let me level with you.
LEADMALE:All my life, I've been the practical one.
LEADFEMALE:Your father was the dreamer.
LEADMALE:So when this opportunity came along, I could hear his voice like he was standing next to me.
LEADFEMALE:"Sophia, take a chance.
LEADMALE:Go for it.
OTHERFEMALE:" I didn't mean to hurt you, pussycat.
LEADMALE:I guess I did it for your father.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma That's a load of crap.
LEADMALE:I'm dancing as fast as I can, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Hey, I did a dumb thing, and I feel terrible.
LEADMALE:What else do you want me to say? At least it was a start.
SUPMALE:You can also tell me again how everything is going to work out just fine.
SUPMALE:Everything is gonna work out just fine.
OTHERMALE:All the Kid has to do is step into that ring tomorrow, and we'll make our money back.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, he's gone! What? Pepe's gone! I went to take him milk and cookies, and his room is empty.
LEADFEMALE:He can't be gone! We have to find him! Sophia, where are you going? Out the window before I'm thrown out.
LEADFEMALE:On my own, at least I can tuck and roll.
SUPFEMALE:Are you sure this is the right place? No, but it was the only address we could find in Pepe's room.
LEADFEMALE:I feel uncomfortable about going through Pepe's things.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
SUPMALE:Although it was kind of exciting opening his closet and seeing his little boxing trunks hanging there with that provocative nickname on 'em.
LEADMALE:Blanche, Everlast is a brand name, not a nickname.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of a place is this, anyway? I don't know.
LEADMALE:An old office building or a warehouse.
LEADMALE:Looks to me like the kind of place where shady dealings go on.
LEADFEMALE:I say we just forget our money and save our behinds.
OTHERMALE:Why? You've got a lot more behind than you do money.
SUPFEMALE:No, I'm with you.
SUPFEMALE:I say let's cut our losses and get out of here.
SUPFEMALE: Excuse me.
LEADMALE:This is a private session.
SUPMALE:What is going on here? What does it look like? The opposition kidnapped our fighter and is trying to turn him into a sissy boy by making him play the violin.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Pepe.
LEADMALE:Ma! Ladies, I guess I've got some explaining to do.
OTHERFEMALE:You sure do.
OTHERFEMALE:Like why you snuck out on us.
SUPFEMALE:Like why you used us.
LEADFEMALE:Like why you're speaking better English than Sylvester Stallone.
LEADFEMALE:Pepe, what is this all about? The violin.
LEADFEMALE:In two days, I have an audition for the Juilliard School of Music.
LEADMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:And I'm Jimmy Swaggart's favorite way to pass a lonely afternoon.
LEADMALE:No, it's true.
LEADFEMALE:This is my teacher.
LEADMALE:He's been coaching me in the evenings.
SUPMALE:I see.
LEADMALE:And is there anything else that you feel we're entitled to know before we kiss you and the $3,000 goodbye? You'll get your money back.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna fight tomorrow.
SUPMALE:I need that purse in case I get into Juilliard.
LEADMALE:You need a purse to go to Juilliard? You understood more when he spoke Spanish, didn't you, Rose? Frankly, I don't understand much, either.
LEADMALE:Pepe, why didn't you tell us all this when Sophia first brought you home? I was afraid you'd back out of the deal.
OTHERMALE:I needed your money for the entrance fee for the fight.
LEADFEMALE:Entrance fee? Oh, yeah, right.
LEADMALE:Didn't I mention that? No problem.
LEADFEMALE:It comes out of Rose's share.
LEADFEMALE:What about the Spanish? Why did you pretend to only know Spanish? Image.
OTHERMALE:Cuban boxers are supposed to know their right from their left, not much else.
LEADMALE:And you think that we are that narrow-minded and prejudiced that we actually felt that way? You bought into it, didn't you? Hey, I didn't invent Kid Pepe.
LEADMALE:I just conformed to your image of a simple-minded Hispanic fighter.
LEADMALE:Well, I am a Cuban.
LEADFEMALE:But hath not a Cuban eyes? Hath not a Cuban hands? Organs? Dimensions? Senses? Affections? Passions? Fed with the same food? Hurt with the same weapons? Subject to the same diseases? Healed by the same means? Warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as you are? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? I also considered auditioning for the Actors Studio.
SUPFEMALE:Why does every fighter become an actor? Just once, I'd like it the other way around, if for no other reason than to see Chevy Chase get his butt kicked.
OTHERMALE:You can't fight.
LEADFEMALE:You can't take a chance like that.
OTHERMALE:I have to.
LEADMALE:I need the money for school.
LEADFEMALE:What about your hands? What if something happens to your hands? They'll be fine.
LEADFEMALE:And after tomorrow, I'll never fight again.
OTHERMALE:Or never play the violin again.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Are we back to real life? Or are the two of you performing a scene from Golden Boy? Ladies, I've spent years working with this boy, watching him turn into a masterful musician.
LEADFEMALE:You yourselves have heard how he makes the violin sing.
OTHERFEMALE:But his fate is in your hands.
LEADMALE:Please Please don't make him step into that ring tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:You mean and lose all our money? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:That's the most touching thing I've ever heard.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what to say.
LEADMALE:I do.
SUPMALE:Fat chance, grandpa! Oh, no! What's everybody doing up? We settled this.
LEADFEMALE:The Kid wants to fight, and we need him to fight.
LEADFEMALE:There's no problem here.
SUPMALE:Everybody back to bed.
LEADMALE:Ma, stop that.
LEADMALE:We have to consider this very carefully.
LEADMALE:We could be holding the man's fate in our hands.
LEADMALE:I once held a man's fate in my hands.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm shocked.
SUPFEMALE:It was back in high school.
LEADMALE:I was dating the quarterback of the football team.
SUPFEMALE:All the major colleges were trying to recruit him.
OTHERMALE:I was pretty sure he was leaning toward Notre Dame 'cause he asked me how to spell it.
SUPFEMALE:But secretly, I was hoping for Alabama.
SUPMALE:Going to Notre Dame would put such a wrench in our relationship, with all those priests skulking about the campus.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, one night, he told me he'd finally made his decision.
SUPFEMALE:He was gonna enroll at the little junior college just 5 miles outside of town.
LEADFEMALE:When I said, "Honey, why? They don't even have a football team," he answered by slipping a ring on my finger and proposing marriage.
LEADFEMALE:well, I could not believe it.
SUPFEMALE:I sat there for almost half an hour just staring at that ring.
SUPMALE:Finally I said, "Honey, this will not do.
LEADFEMALE:I cannot accept this ring.
OTHERFEMALE:" Because you loved him too much to stand in the way of his career.
LEADFEMALE:No, because it was a piece of cheap glass, and the band was turning my finger green.
LEADMALE:Well, no matter what your reasons were, you obviously made the right decision.
OTHERFEMALE:He probably went on to a very successful career in football.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, he was so crushed by my rejection that he gave up football and turned gay.
SUPFEMALE:You don't "turn gay.
LEADFEMALE:" You're either gay, or you're not.
LEADFEMALE:You had nothing to do with it.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, if he had been gay before, he would have had better taste in jewelry.
LEADFEMALE:That sure convinced me.
SUPFEMALE:Let's get some shut-eye.
SUPFEMALE:It's almost fight time.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma! Dorothy, I'm not asking the Kid to win.
SUPFEMALE:He has to step in the ring, and we make our money.
LEADMALE:Sophia, if he steps in the ring, he might hurt his hands.
OTHERFEMALE:Unless it turns out that he's so bad that he gets knocked out before he can throw a punch.
SUPFEMALE:Is everybody thinking what I'm thinking? That that was a really mean thing to say.
LEADMALE:As a general rule, Rose, you should not be the first to answer.
SUPMALE:Rose, if we can convince Pepe just to show up there and get knocked out, everybody'll get what they want.
SUPMALE:What if he won't go along with that? We'll talk him into it.
LEADMALE:There's no shame in taking a dive.
LEADFEMALE:In Sicily, it's a time-honored tradition.
LEADFEMALE:Pepe, could we have a word with you? There's something we'd like to discuss.
OTHERFEMALE:Can it wait? Right now, I've got a few things on my mind.
LEADMALE:Like that big sucker over in the other corner? That's right at the top of the list.
LEADMALE:We want to talk about your fight strategy.
LEADMALE:We have an idea.
LEADMALE:Yeah? What do you want me to do? Fall down.
SUPMALE:What?! They want you to take a dive.
SUPFEMALE:Ma! It wouldn't be a dive, exactly.
OTHERFEMALE:Just protect your hands by not using 'em.
LEADFEMALE:If you get knocked out, you get knocked out.
LEADMALE:I can't do that.
LEADFEMALE:It's immoral.
SUPFEMALE:Immoral? What's so moral about two guys standing up in the ring beating each other bloody? It just isn't fair.
SUPMALE:To whom? To the gamblers? Gambling is illegal in this state.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, you're such an underdog, even Benny the Weasel won't give odds.
SUPMALE:I overheard that at bingo the other night.
SUPFEMALE:This way, everybody wins, and nobody gets hurt.
SUPMALE:What's wrong with that? All right, I'll do it.
LEADFEMALE:Great!  Hey, Pepe, your mother's a tramp! I'm gonna kill you, Gonzales.
LEADFEMALE:It's a good thing he doesn't play trumpet.
SUPMALE:His lip looks like meat loaf.
SUPFEMALE:Just relax.
LEADMALE:Don't be nervous.
SUPMALE:I'm not nervous.
SUPFEMALE:Are your hands all right? They're fine.
LEADMALE:He never threw a punch.
SUPFEMALE:That's all behind you now, Pepe.
LEADFEMALE:This is the moment you wanted.
LEADFEMALE:Good luck.
LEADMALE:Before I start this piece, I just have one question to ask.
LEADMALE:Do I play the violin? Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:I'm afraid I can't remember the piece I'm supposed to play.
LEADMALE:Look, this happens sometimes after a fight.
SUPMALE:Can I come back tomorrow? I'm afraid not.
SUPFEMALE:You won't be eligible again until next year.
LEADMALE:Jeez, I can't believe I blew it.
OTHERMALE:Pepe, it's not your fault.
SUPMALE:They are not going to give you another chance because you're Cuban.
LEADFEMALE:Huh?  Because you're Cuban.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh Because I'm Cuban.
SUPFEMALE:But hath not a Cuban eyes? Hath not a Cuban hands? Organs? Dimensions? Senses? Affections? Passions? Fed with the same food? Hurt with the same weapons? Subject to the same diseases? Healed by the same means? Warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as you are? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant! That was the finest audition for the acting school that we've seen all week.
SUPMALE:Congratulations.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so glad Pepe has the opportunity to be an actor.
OTHERFEMALE:Why? When was the last time you saw a Cuban Macbeth? He'll get out of school and spend his whole career getting arrested on TV cop shows.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you don't see the bright side of anything, do you? No.
LEADMALE:But I can fake a smile.
OTHERFEMALE:Congratulations, Pepe.
LEADMALE:I'm so happy for you.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Thanks, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Girls, you will never guess who I just got off the phone with.
OTHERMALE:Trudy McMann, your best friend from high school.
SUPFEMALE:She's coming to Miami for your high-school reunion.
OTHERMALE:Sophia, that's incredible.
SUPMALE:You must have ESP.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I have a phone extension in my bedroom.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, how many times do I have to tell you not to listen in on my conversations? About twice a year.
LEADFEMALE:Like your phone is ringing off the hook.
SUPFEMALE:Like you got such a full social calendar.
LEADMALE:You're the only person who ever got a refund on call waiting.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Ma, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, high-school reunions can be so much fun.
SUPMALE:I will never forget mine.
LEADFEMALE:I was the most successful person there.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, didn't you go to school with that brilliant doctor who won the Nobel Prize? Oh, yes, but she let her looks go to hell.
LEADFEMALE:You do sound excited, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Well, I am, I am.
LEADFEMALE:But mostly it's about seeing Trudy again.
SUPFEMALE:A girl never had a better friend than Trudy McMann.
LEADFEMALE:What, Ma? Oh, nothing.
OTHERMALE:My underwear just hiked up on me.
LEADFEMALE:Right while you were lying.
SUPFEMALE:Why do you say I'm lying? "A girl never had a better friend than Trudy McMann"? Somebody here doesn't remember prom night, 1946.
LEADMALE:Why? What happened? I don't know.
SUPMALE:I'm that somebody.
SUPFEMALE:No, I think what Ma is referring to  is a little practical joke that Trudy played on me.
SUPFEMALE:All of us on the tennis team decided that we would wear our tennis whites to the prom.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I showed up, and I was the only one.
SUPMALE:Oh, no! Your date must have been horrified.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Her brother was a really good sport about it.
LEADMALE:No, Trudy and I played a lot of practical jokes on each other.
LEADMALE:It was all part of a happy, healthy rivalry.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I was the butt of all kinds of jokes growing up.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, it ran in the family.
SUPFEMALE:In our breakfast room, we had one whole wall covered with "kick me" signs we had collected.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, there was a story attached to each one of them.
SUPMALE:And in some cases, the original Scotch tape.
SUPFEMALE:So when's Trudy coming? Uh week after next.
SUPFEMALE:Which reminds me, I have to rush.
LEADMALE:Where to? Tennis lessons.
LEADFEMALE:I figure, if she's gonna be here, we ought to have a nice, quiet game.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's sweet.
SUPFEMALE:And a lot of crap.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna mop the court with her.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my.
OTHERFEMALE:Looks like our Dorothy still holds a grudge.
LEADFEMALE:'Course she holds a grudge.
LEADFEMALE:We Sicilians are good at that.
SUPMALE:That, and holding a grudge.
LEADMALE:Sophia, you said "holding a grudge" twice.
SUPMALE:Hey, if you're good at something, you brag about it.
LEADFEMALE:I am so excited.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe I'm going to see Trudy again after all these years.
LEADFEMALE:I'm excited for you, too, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:That's why I want everything perfect.
LEADFEMALE:I'm making Scandinavia's oldest and most traditional appetizer treat
LEADFEMALE:cheese and crackers.
SUPMALE:Cheese and crackers, Rose? Not eggs gafloofen? Ham and gunterhoggins? Pigs in a svenkabluden? No, but you sure know how to make a girl's mouth water.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God.
SUPFEMALE:That's her.
LEADFEMALE:I sure hope time has been good to Trudy.
LEADMALE:Good, not great.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Trudy.
LEADMALE:Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh  It's been so long.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you look It's been so long.
LEADMALE:I know, and you
LEADMALE:you look exactly the way you did at our high-school graduation.
LEADFEMALE:'Course, rumors were that you were three months' pregnant.
SUPMALE:I want you to meet my husband Jack.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't tell me you had such a handsome husband.
LEADMALE:Didn't tell you he was rich, either.
OTHERMALE:That's my Trudy.
OTHERMALE:You haven't lost your sense of humor.
SUPMALE:Or those pesky ten pounds.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Petrillo, is that you? No, it's Jane Fonda.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Give us a hug.
OTHERFEMALE:Aw, Trudy, it's so good to see you again.
SUPMALE:Honey, meet my roommates
SUPMALE:Rose and Blanche.
LEADMALE:It's a pleasure.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy's told us so much about you.
SUPMALE:All good, I hope.
LEADMALE:Well, actually Sit! Well, finally I get to meet the infamous Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, has Trudy told me stories about you two.
SUPMALE:I'll bet she has.
LEADFEMALE:We had such a great time back in high school.
LEADFEMALE:Like the time you and Trudy ran against each other for class treasurer? You know, back in St.
OTHERMALE:Olaf, I ran for president of the Bull Castration Club.
LEADFEMALE:There is no sound in this world sweeter than a bull's moo as it climbs an octave.
LEADFEMALE:Did you win? No.
LEADFEMALE:Lost by a hair.
LEADFEMALE:I admired you after that loss, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:You just picked up the pieces and went on.
LEADFEMALE:Just like you did after Stanley ran off with that stewardess.
OTHERMALE:Boy, I envy you your gumption.
LEADFEMALE:And I your breast implants.
SUPMALE:This may not be my place, but you two hardly sound like old friends.
LEADMALE:Blanche is right.
LEADFEMALE:We should be more positive.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, you look wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:The left one turned out nice.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy! Oh, come on, Rose.
LEADMALE:I'm just kidding.
LEADFEMALE:They're both practically the same size.
LEADFEMALE:How about giving me a hand in the kitchen? Were they like that in high school, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Petrillo? Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Her breasts were actually a lot smaller back then.
LEADFEMALE:I meant, were they rivals? What is this
SUPMALE:Nova? I don't have all the answers.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid you'll have to excuse Sophia, Jack.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:You heard that? I thought I was safe backed up against these pillows.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't we see what's keeping Trudy and Dorothy? Probably got caught up reminiscing.
LEADFEMALE:You know how it is when old pals get together.
LEADMALE:Excuse us.
LEADMALE:Well, that's that.
SUPFEMALE:How does it feel to have your butt whipped? Well, sometimes I find it strangely titillating, but Oh! You were talking to her.
LEADFEMALE:Trudy, how about if tomorrow we play a real game? Something that requires real skill.
SUPMALE:You mean like midget ice bowling? I'm talking about tennis, you doofus.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't you afraid of being humiliated on the tennis court? Me humiliated? I think you forget, Trudy, we have to wear tennis dresses.
OTHERFEMALE:You're on, you pathetic middle-aged cow.
LEADMALE:I am looking forward to it, you miserable sack of cellulite.
LEADFEMALE:Did I tell you that Larry Prowse called the other day? Really? Did he ever get married? Three times.
SUPFEMALE:Actually four, if you count Victor.
SUPFEMALE:Can you believe it? Two women competing like that, and there's not even a man at stake.
LEADFEMALE:In Sicily, women compete for everything.
LEADFEMALE:The most famous example is the Great String-Cheese War of '47.
OTHERFEMALE:But why should I bore you with that? You all have college credits.
SUPMALE:You took history.
LEADMALE:Sophia, have you been out in the hot sun too long? It's a possibility.
OTHERMALE:Is there wax running out of my ears? Boy, Trudy is beating the dickens out of Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh I just have to catch my breath.
LEADFEMALE:Are we gonna play, or do you wanna forfeit? No way.
LEADFEMALE:No, Dorothy Zbornak doesn't know the meaning of the word "forfeit.
LEADMALE:" And she's a teacher, too.
LEADFEMALE:No wonder the Japanese are ahead of us.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna kill you, Trudy.
SUPMALE:Oh, do you really think she can make a comeback? I'm sure she can.
LEADMALE:Dorothy's running Trudy all over the court.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Trudy tripped.
LEADMALE:And she's not getting up.
LEADFEMALE:You think something's wrong? I think she's fainted.
LEADMALE:I hope it's not anything worse.
SUPMALE:It is.
OTHERFEMALE:I've seen that look before.
LEADFEMALE:You don't think? There are two things in this world a Sicilian knows.
LEADMALE:When pasta sticks to a wall, it's done.
LEADFEMALE:When a body sticks to cement, it's dead.
LEADFEMALE:Why did it have to happen this way? I feel like a murderer! I will not hear any more of that nonsense.
LEADMALE:It was a freak occurrence on a tennis court.
SUPMALE:She's right, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:You did nothing wrong.
LEADMALE:Technically.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, nothing that would hold up in a court of law.
OTHERMALE:But why Trudy? She was the most energetic, alive person I ever knew.
LEADMALE:At the Center, Dorothy, we teach acceptance.
SUPFEMALE:In life, some things are inevitable, and you just have to accept them.
SUPMALE:She is right, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I know because I've been there myself.
LEADFEMALE:You killed your best friend, too, Blanche? Sorry, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:I remember I was a blossoming belle who had just won the Little Miss Magnolia Pageant.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, before you start, realize I am very vulnerable now and in no mood to hear a story about you and some yahoo cracker with four first names pawing at each other under a magnolia tree.
LEADMALE:Well, pardon me, Dorothy, but we can't all come from places as socially acceptable as Brooklyn.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Go on with the story.
LEADFEMALE:Just try to shy away from words like "tarnation" and "catfish.
LEADMALE:" Fine.
LEADMALE:Anyway, I was about eight years old when I first met Cathy Lee on the playground.
LEADMALE:We became fast friends, just as thick as Louisiana blackstrap molasses on a stake of johnnycakes as high as an elephant's knee On a riverboat floating down the Mississippi delta.
LEADMALE:Finish the damn story, Blanche! Anyway, it was at our Southern seafood fry that I proudly dragged Cathy Lee over to meet my folks.
SUPFEMALE:My mama took one look at Cathy Lee and forbad me ever to see her again.
OTHERFEMALE:Why? Because her mother was not in the Daughters of the Confederacy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! How my heart went out to little Cathy Lee, standing there while our servants snickered at her servants.
SUPFEMALE:But Mama insisted I break off the friendship, or I wouldn't get brand-new riding boots for Christmas.
OTHERFEMALE:So I did.
SUPMALE:Blanche, why is this a story about acceptance? Because years later, to get back at me, Cathy Lee slept with my daddy.
LEADFEMALE:That was something I had to accept.
LEADMALE:Mama accepted it, too.
SUPMALE:Along with a brand-new Cadillac Eldorado for her birthday.
LEADFEMALE:You know, my family had a few dollars, and I loved them dearly, but when you get right down to it, basically, they were trash.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:The reunion'll get your mind off of it.
SUPFEMALE:People should be coming in a couple of hours.
SUPFEMALE:The party.
LEADMALE:The party! I totally forgot! There is no way I can face those people.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, of course you can.
LEADFEMALE:You were all friends of Trudy's.
LEADFEMALE:You can console each other.
LEADFEMALE:It'll help you to cope.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe this is just what I need.
LEADMALE:Aw, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Good for you, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Of course, breaking the news will not be easy.
SUPFEMALE:Want my advice? Wait a couple of hours before you do.
LEADFEMALE:Stuff like this can put a real damper on happy hour.
OTHERMALE:And listen, Rose, remember, mum's the word.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy will break the bad news in due time.
SUPFEMALE:OK? Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Has anyone seen Dorothy? She said hello and then disappeared.
LEADMALE:Is there a problem? No! No problem at all.
OTHERFEMALE:Everything's fine.
LEADFEMALE:It's not like anyone died or anything.
SUPMALE:It's so good to see everyone.
SUPMALE:But where's Trudy? She hasn't seen me in years.
LEADFEMALE:I can't wait to see the look on her face.
OTHERFEMALE:You could wait six months, it wouldn't change.
SUPMALE:It's been almost two hours.
LEADFEMALE:We can't keep up this charade.
LEADFEMALE:Somebody has got to get Dorothy to come out and break the news.
LEADFEMALE:But she's so fragile now.
LEADFEMALE:We have to be tender and compassionate, kindly and sympathetic and caring and understanding Stop babbling, you yutz.
SUPMALE:I'll do it, I'll do it.
OTHERMALE:Picture it
LEADFEMALE:Sicily, 1852.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, I am in no mood.
LEADFEMALE:And besides, you weren't alive in 1852.
LEADMALE:What? We can't learn from history? It was mid-century and a disillusioned Italy looked to the house of Savoy for leadership.
SUPMALE:Giuseppe Garibaldi, our courageous leader, and not a bad dresser, thought, "Let's regain some national pride and jump into this Crimean War thing.
SUPFEMALE:" Of course, there was a big kickoff party at Giuseppe's beach house, and everyone came.
OTHERFEMALE:Coincidentally, this was also the night his wife Rosa hit her sexual peak.
OTHERMALE:Ma, I am in here because of guilt.
OTHERFEMALE:This is not a story about guilt.
SUPMALE:This is a story about being a bad hostess.
SUPMALE:While Rosa had Giuseppe in the bedroom with his saber around his ankles, were strip-searching mice for a piece of cheese.
SUPMALE:Ma, so what's your point? That Rosa and I throw bad parties? That's my minor point.
LEADFEMALE:My major point is that, like Rosa, you're screwing around in the bedroom when there are important things to do outside.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:That makes sense.
SUPMALE:I mean, you went the long way around but that actually makes sense.
LEADFEMALE:Look, pussycat, your friends deserve to know about Trudy.
SUPFEMALE:And they'll understand, because they are your friends.
SUPMALE:Oh, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, thanks.
SUPMALE:Well here goes.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody Everybody, can I have your attention, please? Uh I know I've been a bit scarce tonight, but there is a reason.
SUPFEMALE:Something tragic happened this morning.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma, I need your help.
LEADMALE:Sure, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Trudy's dead.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:It happened this morning when we were playing tennis.
LEADFEMALE:Trudy's heart just couldn't take it.
OTHERMALE:I'm so sorry that I dragged her out on the court and made her run back and forth so hard.
SUPFEMALE:I wish it had been me instead of her, because it's all my fault.
SUPFEMALE:We might as well take down that banner and put up one that says, "Welcome to the Dorothy Killed Trudy Party"!  Oh, darn.
LEADFEMALE:Someone's late.
LEADMALE:Dorothy'll have to give her speech all over again.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, everybody!  Trudy? I don't believe this.
LEADMALE:Is that you? In the flesh.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but I can't believe you're really here! I don't understand! How did you? It was all staged, Rose.
LEADMALE:A patented Trudy McMann practical joke.
SUPMALE:Well, I don't find that one bit funny.
LEADFEMALE:It was cruel, Trudy.
SUPFEMALE:Come on! It was just a practical joke like we did in high school.
LEADMALE:Some of the things we did in high school are not necessarily appropriate when we're adults.
LEADMALE:Like staying up all night and carousing around, dating every other man you meet.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm losing credibility here, aren't I? Trudy, you did a very cruel thing.
LEADFEMALE:OK.
LEADFEMALE:OK.
LEADFEMALE:If I went too far, I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe you ought to apologize to Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:She's back in her bedroom.
SUPMALE:Uh, Dorothy? Are you all right? Go away.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, honey, it's Rose.
SUPFEMALE:We need to talk.
LEADMALE:I said go away.
LEADMALE:Leave it to me.
LEADMALE:In a few minutes, I'll have her beaming from ear to ear.
OTHERMALE: Oh, my God! Trudy! Dorothy! Jack! How come you're alive? How come you're in bed with my husband? I asked you first.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, it's not what it looks like.
OTHERMALE:Obviously.
LEADMALE:Dorothy thought I was dead, tried to comfort you, and the two of you got carried away.
LEADFEMALE:OK, it is what it looks like.
LEADMALE:I can't believe this.
LEADMALE:I was just playing a prank.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have any idea how I feel? What kind of person jumps into bed with her dearest friend's husband? Not necessarily a bad person.
LEADMALE:Sometimes circumstances Oh.
LEADFEMALE:You were talking about her.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'm gonna faint.
OTHERMALE:Gotcha! Dorothy, what the hell is going on here? Revenge! It suddenly occurred to me
LEADFEMALE:what if this was the ultimate practical joke? So I dragged it out of Jack, and the two of us cooked up this topper.
OTHERMALE:Jack, I can't believe you went along with this.
LEADMALE:So I got in bed with Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:It was a joke! Don't even think it, Ma.
LEADMALE:If you knew before, why didn't you tell me? Ma, you have a big mouth.
LEADMALE:Me? If I had a big mouth, do you think your one-night stand with the bug man would still be a secret? Oops.
SUPMALE:Dorothy Zbornak, this is the most underhanded, sneaky practical joke anyone has ever made, and I have just one thing to say.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, have I missed you! Oh, Trudy Trudy! I've missed you, too.
SUPFEMALE:Wait just a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:You two are not mad? Are you kidding? Our friendship was built on years of this.
LEADFEMALE:Trudy, you have made this one hell of a reunion.
SUPMALE:Speaking of which, there's a party out there.
LEADFEMALE:Come on! Well, Dorothy Zbornak, I cannot believe you put Rose and me through this.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah! What are you talking about? You knew Trudy was playing a practical joke all along, and you never shared it with your best friends? We thought you were devastated.
LEADFEMALE:We suffered right along with you.
LEADMALE:Yeah! That was insensitive.
SUPFEMALE:Insensitive! Selfish.
SUPMALE:Selfish! As far as we are concerned, Dorothy Zbornak, you have gone too far this time.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:This is unforgivable.
SUPMALE:We are never gonna speak to you again.
LEADMALE:Right! Gotcha.
SUPFEMALE:Very, very convincing, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I can't take all the credit.
OTHERFEMALE:I did have some help.
LEADFEMALE:Right, Rose? Rose? Rose? 
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know you were good at making malts.
LEADMALE:Good? I'm an expert.
LEADMALE:Didn't I tell you I worked in a malt shop when I was in high school? Soda jerk? No, thanks.
LEADMALE:I'll have a malted.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't you gonna have one, Dorothy? Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:After you've worked in a malt shop, the greatest pleasure you can get is slurping up what's left in the blender.
LEADFEMALE:Yum.
SUPMALE:Is it any wonder I never breast-fed her? What are you doing out? I thought you were in your room.
SUPMALE:I whittled a gun out of a bar of soap and overpowered the guards.
SUPFEMALE:I went to the mini-mall.
SUPMALE:They opened a Little Slice of Sicily pizzeria.
OTHERFEMALE:So I walk in, and this guy strikes up a conversation with me.
LEADMALE:Turns out he owns the chain and wants me to be in a commercial.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, that's amazing! I'll say.
LEADMALE:It's rare you find anybody in a mini-mall who even speaks English.
LEADMALE:OK.
SUPFEMALE:OK, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you going to shoot this commercial? Well, we discussed many exotic locations, and we settled on right here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, now hold on.
LEADMALE:I don't want a TV crew coming in here, messing up my kitchen, setting up all that video equipment.
LEADFEMALE:How about shooting it in your bedroom, Blanche? The equipment's already set up.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, I don't think you're gonna have to worry.
LEADFEMALE:It's not gonna happen.
LEADFEMALE:Has anybody seen a small bottle of pills? Brown bottle, Patton's pharmacy label, your name on the prescription? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Never saw it.
SUPFEMALE:Ma.
OTHERMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Yesterday, I was looking for the oregano and accidentally knocked them into the sink.
LEADMALE:I forgot all about it.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:Now I won't be able to refill the prescription till tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Tomorrow's a holiday.
LEADMALE:Pharmacy's closed.
LEADMALE:Maybe I have another bottle in my room.
LEADFEMALE:I can't understand how you could forget to tell Rose about that accident.
LEADMALE:Forgive me, my memory's not as good as it used to be.
LEADMALE:Nothing on me is as good as it used to be.
SUPFEMALE:Once upon a time, I had a butt you could bounce a quarter on.
OTHERFEMALE:Now you could lose a Krugerrand in the creases.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, meet my director Sy Ferber.
LEADFEMALE:Sy, my daughter Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Daughter? You're kidding.
OTHERFEMALE:Sy, I assure you, I won't be flattered if you say you thought she was my sister.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:I just had an idea.
SUPFEMALE:Little Slice of Sicily is a family restaurant, and a mother-daughter commercial would be great.
LEADFEMALE:How'd you like to be in it? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I'd have to check my schedule.
LEADMALE:You see, I'm a substitute teacher.
SUPFEMALE:Please! So someone else sets up the driver's-ed cones.
SUPMALE:All right, Ma.
SUPMALE:Actually, Sy, I'd be delighted to do it.
SUPMALE:Beautiful! Guess what.
LEADMALE:I'm going to be in that commercial with Ma.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, I told you I don't want a bunch of strangers traipsing through my kitchen.
SUPMALE:We'll pay you $1,000 a day.
LEADMALE:Allow me to give you the grand tour.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, don't come in here.
SUPFEMALE:Everyone out! What's wrong, Rose? The slightest noise, and my humpaflagel cake will fall.
SUPMALE:Oh, why, why, why? Rose! Honey, calm down.
LEADFEMALE:You could make another cake.
LEADMALE:Look, we're gonna set it up over here.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, I'll put you here.
SUPMALE:Sophia, I want you Excuse me, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
LEADMALE:I'm very upset.
LEADFEMALE:Rose! This man is paying me $1,000 a day to make a commercial in my kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:I live here.
LEADFEMALE:I've every right to use this kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Miss, this'll only take a second.
LEADFEMALE:It'll only take a second to knock you on your keister, buddy.
LEADFEMALE:What's it gonna be? Look, if I wanted this kind of abuse, I'd be directing The Roseanne Barr Show.
LEADMALE:Oh, but, Sy Look, the commercial is off.
LEADMALE:Just forget it.
SUPMALE:Well! Rose, now look what you did! I didn't do anything wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, why are you acting like this? I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
OTHERMALE:Get off my damn back! Dorothy, what time is it? Uh, 9:30.
OTHERMALE:Why do you ask? Phyllis Gluckman is giving me a ride to my acting lesson.
OTHERFEMALE:If I'm gonna be in a commercial, I wanna be good.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? The commercial is off.
OTHERFEMALE:No, it isn't.
LEADMALE:I got the director to change his mind.
SUPFEMALE:He's coming back here to shoot the commercial? No, he doesn't want to get anywhere near Rose.
SUPMALE:He's gonna shoot it at his studio.
LEADMALE:But if he shoots it at his studio, then I get screwed and have nothing to show for it.
SUPFEMALE:Welcome to show business.
LEADFEMALE:Well, goodbye.
LEADMALE:Hi, Sophia.
OTHERMALE:Later.
SUPMALE:Hi, girls.
SUPMALE:Oh, loved meeting your director friend yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, are you all right? Never better.
SUPFEMALE:Why do you ask? Maybe because yesterday you acted like a crazy person? Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I was a little on edge.
SUPMALE:Don't worry, it won't happen again.
OTHERMALE:Rose, what are those pills for? The doctor prescribed them when I wrenched my back.
LEADMALE:I didn't know you'd hurt your back.
LEADFEMALE:It's an old farm injury from St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf.
SUPMALE:I'll never forget when it happened.
LEADMALE:It was time to plant the crops, but after 17 years of pulling the plow, poor old Bessie was worn out.
LEADMALE:Why didn't you just get another mule? Bessie wasn't a mule.
SUPFEMALE:She was a big fat lady who pulled farm plows for a living.
LEADMALE:For God's sake! What about tractors? Come on, Blanche.
LEADMALE:If she was too old to pull a plow, how could she ever pull a tractor? Anyway, we had to till the soil, so I volunteered to pull the plow, and I hurt my back.
OTHERMALE:How long have you been taking these pills? I guess around 30 years.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, I doubt that your doctor wanted you to take those things for 30 years.
LEADMALE:What makes you such a medical expert? The doctor prescribed those pills, and I only take them when I need them.
LEADFEMALE:Have you ever considered the possibility that you might be dependent on them? Are you calling me an addict? I really resent that.
SUPMALE:You think I can't do without those? Here, you take 'em.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, Rose! No, I insist.
SUPMALE:Obviously you don't believe me.
LEADFEMALE:This is the best way to prove it.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, what the hell are you doing? Oh, I couldn't sleep, so I decided to rearrange the kitchen cabinets.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry I woke you.
LEADMALE:Go on back to bed.
LEADMALE:Rose, what are you doing with these? Nothing.
SUPMALE:You were looking for those pills.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, get rid of them.
LEADMALE:You can't do that.
LEADMALE:They're mine.
OTHERMALE:Get rid of them.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought you said you could take these or leave 'em.
LEADMALE:That's true, and right now, I wanna take them.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, you can't stop taking these pills.
SUPMALE:You have a problem.
LEADFEMALE:I can stop! And I'll start stopping tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Oh, boy, will you be proud of me.
LEADFEMALE:You just wait.
LEADFEMALE:Only I can't stop tonight.
LEADMALE:Why not? Because Because.
LEADFEMALE:Because tonight is the anniversary of the death of my beloved cat Fluffy.
LEADMALE:You have never had cats.
LEADFEMALE:You're allergic.
LEADMALE:OK, it's the anniversary of the death of my beloved brother Fluffy.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna have to do better than that.
LEADMALE:Aw, give her some credit.
LEADFEMALE:The woman has never told a lie in her life.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody does it great the first time.
LEADFEMALE:Look, the truth is I can't stop tonight because I'm afraid.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know if I can.
LEADMALE:That's because you're hooked on these, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:But, honey, there's a place for people with this kind of problem.
LEADFEMALE:Please, what is she gonna do in the NBA? Rose, let us call a rehabilitation center for you.
SUPMALE:No, I don't need one of those places.
LEADMALE:I can't go to one of those places.
SUPFEMALE:I'd be too ashamed, too embarrassed.
SUPFEMALE:What is there to be ashamed of? You have a medical problem.
OTHERFEMALE:Was Betty Ford embarrassed? Was Liza Minnelli embarrassed? She should have been.
OTHERMALE:Did you see Arthur 2? Rose you have to do this.
LEADMALE:No, I can stop by myself.
LEADMALE:I can quit cold turkey.
LEADMALE:Cold turkey? After 30 years, doing it alone without professional help could be dangerous.
OTHERMALE:I won't be alone.
LEADMALE:I'll be with you.
LEADFEMALE:If you'll just see me through the night, I know I can lick this.
OTHERMALE:Come on, what do you say, girls? Are you in this with me? You bet we are, honey.
LEADFEMALE:This is what friendship is all about.
SUPMALE:Banding together when the going gets tough.
LEADFEMALE:Sacrificing sleep and personal comfort.
LEADMALE:Putting someone else's need ahead of your own.
OTHERFEMALE:It's beautiful.
LEADMALE:Let me know how it turns out in the morning.
LEADMALE:Think this is gonna work? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:We should just go along with whatever she wants to do.
LEADMALE:The important thing is to keep Rose's mind occupied.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, give me some lipstick.
LEADMALE:I'll draw a face on my hand.
LEADMALE:What are you doing up? I've got an hour till my paper route starts, so I thought I'd do some chin-ups.
OTHERFEMALE:I was worried about Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a member of this family, too.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, that's really very sweet, considering we have to get up so darn early tomorrow for that commercial.
OTHERMALE:I said she was family.
LEADMALE:I'd do anything for that girl.
LEADFEMALE:Well, is everybody ready for a spirited game of Googenspritzer? Googenspritzer? You said we were gonna play Monopoly.
OTHERFEMALE:I said it was like Monopoly, only instead of Atlantic City, they use St.
OTHERFEMALE:Olaf geography.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'll be the bank.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:There's the cashbox.
LEADMALE:Honey, this is empty.
SUPMALE:Oh, I know.
LEADMALE:The St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf Bank was one of the first savings and loans to go under.
LEADFEMALE:Bad management? Bad contractor.
LEADMALE:They built the bank on marshland, and it sank.
OTHERMALE:All that was left were a few deposit slips and a pen with a chain attached to it, floating in the muck.
SUPFEMALE:Amazing.
LEADMALE:My story? No.
LEADFEMALE:My patience at this hour! Can we get on with this? OK, I'll go first.
LEADFEMALE:Four.
SUPMALE:Oh, it says, "Pick a card.
LEADMALE:" How odd.
LEADMALE:I can either buy the library or the phone booth in the center of town.
LEADFEMALE:I'll buy the library.
LEADMALE:If I were you, I'd buy the phone booth.
LEADMALE:Why? People use the phone booth.
LEADMALE:It's my turn.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, six.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha! What luck! I own Logenbeuton Avenue! Ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Game's over, I win.
LEADFEMALE:You win? Rose, how? You bought one street in St.
OTHERFEMALE:Olaf.
LEADMALE:I bought the only street in St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf.
SUPFEMALE:That means I'm gonna tear down your phone booth.
SUPMALE:This is the stupidest game! I could just Dorothy, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I could just play all night.
LEADMALE:Set it up again, Rose.
SUPMALE:Rose, how about a piece of Bundt cake? Oh, no, thanks.
LEADMALE:I'll try some, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:"Try some.
LEADFEMALE:" Right, like it's some big experiment, like you got no idea what it tastes like.
LEADMALE:Like you don't shovel it in by the pound every chance you get.
LEADFEMALE:Ma! Girls, I really don't feel very good.
SUPMALE:I gave this a shot, but I can't make it.
LEADMALE:Rose, yes, you can.
SUPFEMALE:No, I can't.
OTHERMALE:I can't, Dorothy! It's too hard.
SUPMALE:I wish you'd all stop acting like you know what I'm going through because you don't.
SUPMALE:You don't have any idea.
LEADMALE:Well, I might not have any idea what it's like to feel the kind of dependency you do, but there was a time in my life when I tried quittin' something.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, you don't mean? Sex, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:I tried quittin' sex.
SUPMALE:Obviously you fell off the wagon.
LEADFEMALE:And onto a naval base.
LEADMALE:It was just after I'd lost George, and it just seemed an appropriate thing to do.
SUPFEMALE:Of course it did.
SUPMALE:Your husband had just died.
LEADMALE:So what? I hadn't.
LEADFEMALE:The point is, I was still feeling a little vulnerable, and I was afraid if I got intimate with somebody too quickly, I might end up getting hurt, so I just gave it up, cold turkey.
SUPFEMALE:And it worked for you, Blanche? Well, not entirely.
LEADFEMALE:Barely a month had gone by before I started feeling those awful stirrings and urgings.
LEADFEMALE:I was like a spring-bloomin' peach bud just ripened to dewy fruition, waitin' to be plucked by the first handsome man to come my way.
OTHERMALE:You were looking for some nooky.
SUPMALE:Exactly.
LEADMALE:Then came the moment of truth.
SUPFEMALE:There was a man, he asked me to sleep with him.
LEADMALE:I said no.
SUPMALE:But I knew something greater than my will power was necessary for me to resist him, so I called my sister.
SUPFEMALE:Did she talk you through it? Oh, better than that.
LEADFEMALE:She drove straight over, took him by the throat, said if he ever tried that again, she'd shoot him through the head.
SUPMALE:Just because he made a pass at you? Oh, did I forget to mention that the man was my sister's husband? I'm going to bed.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you can't.
LEADMALE:Yes, she can.
SUPFEMALE:We're not proving anything by sitting here any longer.
LEADFEMALE:We might as well all go.
LEADMALE:I can't believe I'm hearing this.
LEADMALE:Does this mean you're giving up when you've gotten this far? No, it means I can see the sun coming up over the Donaldsons' house.
LEADMALE:It's morning.
SUPMALE:We made it! She's right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's wonderful! Oh, congratula
SUPMALE:I'll bet you feel better already.
SUPMALE:Oh, I really do and mostly because you guys were there for me.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll never be able to repay you.
LEADMALE:Think nothing of it.
LEADMALE:We were glad to help.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I'm glad to hear you say that because if I can't sleep tonight, we might have to do it all over.
OTHERFEMALE:So, when I say, "action," you pick up the pizza, taste it and say, "Mmm, that's a mighty tasty pizza.
OTHERMALE:" Is everybody ready? Yeah uh, one thing.
LEADFEMALE:Do I look at my mother or at the camera? Look at the camera, and here's a little tip.
SUPMALE:Look at it like you're making love to it.
SUPFEMALE:It might help if you give her a reference she's more familiar with.
SUPFEMALE:OK, this is a rehearsal.
LEADMALE:We're gonna run through it once, and then we'll do it for real.
OTHERMALE:And go! Guess what, Ma.
SUPMALE:I found you some real good pizza like you used to get in Sicily.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, do you stink.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, Dorothy, relax.
LEADFEMALE:Just try and be yourself.
LEADMALE:You can do this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get it this time.
SUPMALE:All right, here we go.
LEADMALE:Everyone settle.
LEADMALE:And go! Guess what, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:I've found some real Sicil No, that's not it.
LEADFEMALE:What is the line? "Ma, I found some real good pizza, just like you used to get back in Sicily.
LEADMALE:" Ah.
LEADMALE:Sy, now I know what the trouble is.
LEADMALE:There's something wrong with the line.
LEADMALE:That's why I can't say it.
LEADMALE:Something wrong with the line? I'm an English teacher.
LEADFEMALE:I should know.
OTHERFEMALE:The reason I can't say it is because the line itself is not grammatical.
LEADMALE:See, it should be "really good pizza," not "real good.
SUPMALE:" "Perfect pizza with pizazz.
LEADFEMALE:" Even better.
SUPMALE:Hey, I can act and write! Gee, I love this business! You don't mind if I make the change, do you? No, not at all.
SUPMALE:In fact, I think I want to make a change, too.
SUPFEMALE:OK, Dorothy, let's see ya smile! This one's for the camera.
SUPFEMALE:And action! Look, Grandma, I've found you a real good pizza, just like you used to get in Sicily.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm that's a mighty That's a mighty lousy pizza! Ma, you never tasted it before? No, and I never will again.
LEADMALE:What the hell are you doing? Sorry, Sy.
LEADMALE:You can't pay me enough to endorse that slime on a shingle.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, this is a nationwide commercial.
LEADFEMALE:There is a lot of money involved here.
SUPMALE:Sorry.
OTHERMALE:There are two things a Sicilian won't do
OTHERMALE:lie about pizza and file a tax return.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it, Sy.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, spit it out! But, Dorothy Right now, Rose! This is Fred Flintstone.
SUPFEMALE:His nose is dissolved, but it's definitely Fred Flintstone.
LEADMALE:They're my vitamins.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry I didn't trust you.
LEADMALE:Don't apologize.
LEADMALE:But I misjudged you, Rose.
SUPMALE:No, you didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Here are my pills.
SUPMALE:I took one last night.
LEADFEMALE:But, Rose, you got through an entire night without them.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought you had it beat.
LEADFEMALE:So did I! Dorothy, when you were staying up with me, I felt like I was safe, that I could rely on your strength to get me through it.
LEADFEMALE:But, Dorothy, you're not enough.
LEADFEMALE:These are even stronger than you are.
LEADMALE:Honey, let me call a recovery center.
SUPFEMALE:No, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Listen, this is not just gonna go away, Rose.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:But I think the first step is for me to make that call.
LEADMALE:Any sign of Rose? Not yet.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Dorothy, I'm a little nervous.
LEADFEMALE:Rose was on those pills for 30 years.
OTHERFEMALE:If one month in the hospital has helped her kick the habit, she may not be the same Rose we know.
SUPFEMALE:She may be an entirely different person.
SUPMALE:I know because it happened to me once.
SUPFEMALE:Before my mama sent me off to beauty camp, I was a pencil-thin, flat-chested, four-eyed nerd.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:You pencil-thin? Hi, girls.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my gosh, have we missed you! Oh, Rose! You look wonderful! Gimme a big hug! I'm so happy to see you! Oh, sweetheart! Oh, Rose! It just must feel wonderful bein' cured! Oh, I'm not cured.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? I'll never be cured, but I know now I can live without drugs my whole life, one day at a time.
SUPMALE:I'm just glad you got that monkey off your back.
LEADMALE:I never had a monkey on my back, Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:Although, when I was a child, I had a chicken named Gordon.
OTHERMALE:Oh, and what a great chicken! And he was a great singer, too.
SUPMALE:Gordon could cluck the scores of all the big Broadway musicals.
LEADMALE:I've heard a lot of poultry do show tunes, but nobody could hold a candle to him.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, no chicken likes to be that near an open flame.
SUPMALE:Same old Rose.
SUPMALE:Same old Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, anyway, he was a great entertainer.
OTHERFEMALE:We thought for a while he was a great dancer, too, till we discovered he had two left wings.
SUPFEMALE:He'd just shuffle along there.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, how he loved music, especially Gilbert and Sullivan.
LEADFEMALE:Oh 
LEADMALE:
OTHERMALE:Ma, did you have a sardine sandwich for lunch again? Dreyfuss! Ma, what the hell is Dreyfuss doing here? Calm down.
SUPMALE:I just ran into Harry Weston.
LEADMALE:They're all leaving town, and they needed someone to watch Dreyfuss.
OTHERFEMALE:I volunteered.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, unvolunteer.
SUPFEMALE:Why? You think I can't do it? You think I'm irresponsible? Yes, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:You think I'm forgetful? Yes, Ma.
LEADMALE:You think I'm irresponsible? You already said that.
LEADFEMALE:That's emphasis.
LEADMALE:You never heard the "I have a dream" speech? Ma, face it.
LEADFEMALE:You cannot be trusted.
LEADMALE:Every time you get yourself into something like this, I end up covering for you.
LEADMALE:I am not gonna end up taking care of this dog.
LEADFEMALE:Did I ever mention that I almost died giving birth to you? The pain was so intense, they gave me a towel to bite on.
LEADFEMALE:They gave you a towel at the hospital? What hospital? You were born on a pinochle table at McSorley's bar.
LEADFEMALE:Hospital? Like your father was a member of the Etna family.
LEADMALE:The closest he ever got to a hospital was when he came to deliver ice.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, guilt is not gonna work.
SUPMALE:You're right, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:I was naive to think you'd give an old woman one last chance to regain her daughter's respect.
LEADFEMALE:Now I guess I'll just stick my head in the oven All right, Ma! Maybe guilt will work.
OTHERFEMALE:But, Ma, this is the last time.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, pussycat.
SUPFEMALE:You won't regret it.
OTHERMALE:Now, would you mind taking him out for a walk tonight? Ma, forget it, forget it.
LEADMALE:The dog is all yours.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Why is there a big hairy beast in my house? My guess is because he bought you dinner.
SUPMALE:Well, Blanche, I gotta run.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thank you for a lovely afternoon, Gary.
SUPFEMALE:I hope I see you again real soon.
LEADMALE:You can count on it.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, Gary.
LEADMALE:Well, you and Gary certainly seem to have hit it off.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why shouldn't we? The man's perfect.
LEADMALE:He only owns the most successful chain of funeral homes in Greater Miami.
LEADMALE:With this heat wave we're having, he's got 'em stacked up like firewood in all four locations.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, girls.
LEADMALE:Is she here yet? Who, Rose? My sister.
SUPMALE:I left you a note on your bathroom mirror.
LEADMALE:Why did you leave a note on my bathroom mirror? It was the only one that had enough steam.
SUPFEMALE:Which sister is this, Rose? My younger sister Holly.
SUPMALE:Frankly, I'm not too happy about it.
OTHERFEMALE:This is a terrible thing to say, but I don't really like her.
LEADMALE:We haven't gotten along since we were kids.
LEADMALE:Why is she coming here, then? Well, she's here on business.
SUPMALE:She's a world-renowned flautist.
LEADFEMALE:She plays the flute? No, Dorothy, she plays the flaut.
SUPMALE:It's a Scandinavian instrument that looks like a tuba, except it's got hair on the bottom.
OTHERMALE:Of course she plays the flute! I'm sorry, I guess I'm just a little wound up.
LEADFEMALE:That's Holly now.
LEADMALE:Will you guys help me through this? Well, sure, absolutely.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks a million.
LEADFEMALE:God, I hate this woman.
SUPMALE:Holly.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Rose! Oh, Rose! It's so good to see you.
SUPMALE:You look just wonderful.
OTHERFEMALE:So do you.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in and meet my friends.
OTHERMALE:This is Wait, wait! Let me! She's attractive, witty, and great fun to be with.
SUPFEMALE:This must be Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:And she's smart, sexy and stylish to a fault.
SUPMALE:This must be Blanche.
LEADMALE:Did I get it right? You're right.
LEADMALE:Thank goodness.
LEADMALE:I worried all the way over here I'd get it backwards.
LEADMALE:I could have lived with smart and sexy.
SUPMALE:You do live with smart and sexy.
LEADMALE:Who's this? Holly, this is Oh, wait, now, Rose, let me.
SUPFEMALE:She's feisty, zesty, and full of old-world charm Sophia! She's mopey, dopey, and full of crap, Rose's sister.
SUPFEMALE:Don't mess with me, kid.
LEADMALE:I have the home-court advantage.
LEADMALE:Honey, what you looking for? Nothing.
LEADMALE:Now, Sophia, tell me the truth.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Dreyfuss is gone.
LEADFEMALE:He ran away? No, we had a falling out and agreed to a trial separation.
SUPMALE:Of course he ran away.
LEADMALE:When? I'm not sure.
SUPFEMALE:I have it pinpointed sometime between 10:15 today and late last Thursday.
LEADFEMALE:You have no recollection of Dreyfuss since last Thursday? I have no recollection, period, since last Thursday.
LEADMALE:Anything could have happened in three days.
LEADMALE:I just hope I'm not carrying Steve Garvey's baby.
OTHERMALE:Honey, listen, don't panic.
SUPFEMALE:As soon as the girls get home from work, we'll fan out through the neighborhood and find Dreyfuss.
SUPFEMALE:No go, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:I need to handle this myself.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Because if Dorothy finds out I lost Dreyfuss, she'll never trust me with anything again.
OTHERMALE:That's why I'm begging you.
OTHERMALE:Please, promise me, on your mother's grave, you won't breathe a word of this to Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:You promise? Yes, sure, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Now I can save what I know about you and the twin rabbinical students for another time.
LEADMALE:Hi, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Gary.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
SUPFEMALE:I just wanted to drop off Blanche's earrings.
LEADFEMALE:They must have fallen off in my car the other night.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:She's in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:No, don't do that.
OTHERMALE:Actually, there's something I want to talk to you about.
LEADMALE:What is it, Gary? Rose, I find you very attractive.
LEADFEMALE:Much more attractive than most of the women I come in contact with.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't most of the women you come in contact with dead? What I was talking about is us.
LEADMALE:Would you consider going out with me? What about Blanche? I think it would be best if she stayed at home.
OTHERMALE:Unless you know something that I don't.
SUPMALE:You're disgusting! Gary, hi! What are you doing here? I was just bringing back your earrings.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I've gotta run.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:See you Saturday? You bet, darling.
LEADFEMALE:Rose Nylund, if I didn't know better, I might think you were tryin' to steal my boyfriend.
LEADMALE:I'm innocent, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I know it.
SUPFEMALE:That's why Gary's dating me.
SUPFEMALE:Ha ha ha! He's a lewd, horny, oversexed beast with five hands! You don't have to build him up to me, honey.
OTHERMALE:I like him fine already.
SUPFEMALE:It's 5:00.
SUPFEMALE:Where's Holly? Out with Dorothy, I think.
OTHERFEMALE:Still? Oh, I'm gonna owe Dorothy big for this one.
SUPMALE:You know something, Rose? I don't think you're being fair to Holly.
SUPMALE:Now I spent three afternoons with her this week, and she was lovely company each time.
SUPMALE:Last night she even took me out to Antonio's.
LEADFEMALE:Antonio's? But that's right down by my office.
LEADMALE:Why didn't you guys call? Holly did call.
OTHERMALE:She said somebody said you weren't there.
LEADMALE:But I was.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess it was just a mix-up.
LEADFEMALE:The point is, we had a terrific time.
LEADMALE:I really like Holly.
LEADFEMALE:Holly! That has to be one of the funniest stories I've heard in ages.
SUPFEMALE:Doesn't Rose ever tell St.
LEADMALE:Olaf stories? All the time.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Rose.
OTHERMALE:Hi, darling.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it sounds like you girls had a nice afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:Nice doesn't begin to describe it.
SUPFEMALE:We went shopping, we had lunch, we saw a movie, and we picked up theater tickets for tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:What are we seeing? Oh, I feel terrible.
LEADFEMALE:See, you told me you'd probably be busy tonight, so I just got seats for Dorothy and Blanche and me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, well, honey, don't worry.
LEADMALE:You can have my ticket.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, Dorothy, that wouldn't be fair.
LEADMALE:No, the three of you should go.
LEADFEMALE:And we can meet for coffee afterwards.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:She's doing it again.
SUPMALE:First it was Antonio's, then it was the tickets.
SUPFEMALE:She's leaving me out intentionally.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, they were just misunderstandings.
LEADMALE:Now you're overreacting.
LEADMALE:I guess so.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, these things happen between sisters all the time.
SUPFEMALE:I remember once my sister Virginia wouldn't talk to me for a month, all because I smiled at her boyfriend.
SUPFEMALE:There.
LEADMALE:Listen to Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Of course, I was skinny-dipping on his property at the time.
LEADMALE:Don't listen to Blanche.
LEADMALE:All right, it was his bathtub.
OTHERMALE:We were blowing suds off of each other when she walked in.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, what is the point of this story? Point? There's no point.
LEADMALE:I just like telling it.
SUPMALE:Well, Blanche, what do you think? Sophia, what have you done? Saved my puckered little Sicilian behind, that's what.
LEADFEMALE:When Dreyfuss didn't come home again this morning, I went to the pet shop and got a duplicate.
LEADMALE:Amazing, isn't it? Yeah, except for one thing.
LEADFEMALE:Dreyfuss came home this afternoon.
OTHERFEMALE:Holy cow! Don't worry, just take that dog back to the pet shop.
LEADMALE:I can't, the pet shop's closed till Monday.
LEADMALE:Somebody help me with the groceries.
LEADMALE:Oh, great.
OTHERMALE:That's Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I gotta get both dogs into my room.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, boys.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Sophia, I'm not too sure that's a good idea.
SUPMALE:Dorothy sees me with these two, she'll know I screwed up.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but there's something I think you're not considering here.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia! Oh, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, I think you're makin' a big mistake.
SUPFEMALE:I just need to keep the new dog hidden till Monday.
LEADMALE:It's a piece of cake.
LEADFEMALE:That's not the mistake I mean.
SUPMALE:With both those dogs in the same room, how are you gonna know which is the old one and which is the new one? I'm screwed.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, help me with these.
SUPFEMALE:We have to meet Holly at the movies in ten minutes.
SUPMALE:OK.
SUPMALE:I am so mad, I could spit.
LEADMALE:Rose, what happened? It's Holly.
LEADFEMALE:Those directions she gave me for meeting you guys for lunch were totally wrong.
LEADMALE:Come on, now, Rose, you don't think she did that to you on purpose? Well, I do.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, that's silly.
OTHERMALE:You don't know Holly.
SUPFEMALE:She just got her directions all mixed up.
LEADFEMALE:It was a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:Just like it was a mistake leaving me out of dinner at Antonio's, and a mistake leaving me home from the play? Rose, you are overreacting to this.
OTHERMALE:Now calm down.
LEADMALE:Let's just go and enjoy the movie.
SUPFEMALE:What movie? We're meeting Holly.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't she mention it to you? No! And I'll suppose you'll say it's just a silly mix-up.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm not falling for that again.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going.
OTHERMALE:Fine, Rose, fine.
OTHERFEMALE:But I do think it's time that you realized that Holly is a terrific person and would not do anything to hurt you or anybody else.
SUPFEMALE:And the sooner you realize that, Rose, the happier we'll all be.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Another slice of cheesecake, Blanche? Oh, I really shouldn't.
LEADMALE:Honey, what harm can it do? Lately you've been eating like a bird.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, Rodan.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, girls, I'm so glad you're still up.
LEADMALE:I need to talk to you.
LEADMALE:I have a problem.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, we know you do.
SUPFEMALE:You gotta stop buying your hair colorin' out of the 99-cent-or-less bin at the Pic 'n Save.
LEADMALE:This problem has to do with Holly.
SUPFEMALE:Her hair's not the color of a Twinkie.
LEADFEMALE:Holly has done something terrible, Blanche, and I think you ought to know Listen, darling, whatever it is, I'm really not interested.
SUPMALE:What? Blanche and I have been talking about this.
LEADFEMALE:There is a problem, all right, but it's not between us and Holly, it's between you and Holly.
OTHERFEMALE:Ever since she arrived, you've been trying to convince us that she's been doing terrible things.
LEADFEMALE:And, Rose, it simply isn't true.
OTHERFEMALE:See, we happen to like Holly.
LEADMALE:So, whatever the problem is, will you just kind of leave us out of it and you settle it with her, OK? All right, Rose, out with it.
LEADMALE:What did Holly do that's so terrible? Why do you care? You won't believe me anyway.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Sicilians can always recognize two things
LEADFEMALE:when someone is telling the truth, and when they've had their fingerprints changed.
SUPMALE:I know whatever you're gonna say is the truth.
OTHERFEMALE:This afternoon I saw Blanche's boyfriend, Gary Tucker, kissing my sister Holly.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please.
SUPFEMALE:You're such a liar.
LEADMALE:I swear on my mother's grave.
LEADFEMALE:OK, OK, I believe you.
SUPMALE:What should I do, Sophia? Well, this is a very complex and perplexing question.
OTHERMALE:It has to do with honesty, friendship, love, hate all the biggies.
LEADFEMALE:So what should I do? Please! Socrates sat under an olive tree in a sheet for years thinking about this kind of stuff.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a poor immigrant with a third-grade education.
SUPFEMALE:Give me two minutes! Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:OK.
LEADMALE:I got it.
OTHERMALE:My Uncle Carlo always used to say, "Honesty is the best policy.
SUPFEMALE:" Of course, Uncle Carlo died a penniless drunk.
LEADFEMALE:I don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:The point is, if you're honest every second of every day, it doesn't always turn out for the best.
LEADMALE:That was the case with my Uncle Carlo.
LEADMALE:He honestly remembered the license number of the trigger man in the Sanducci vendetta.
SUPFEMALE:So what you're saying is that because nobody's gonna believe me anyway, I'm better off if I let people find out what's going on for themselves.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't chisel that into a stone tablet, but it sounds serviceable at this hour.
LEADMALE:Oh, thanks a lot, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Uh, hold it, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I need some advice too.
LEADFEMALE:You need advice from me? Yeah, frightening, isn't it? It's about Dreyfuss.
SUPMALE:OK.
OTHERFEMALE:What about Dreyfuss? The other day I thought he was lost, so I got a second dog, and then the first one came back.
LEADMALE:Sophia, are you kidding me? Come see for yourself.
OTHERMALE:Wow, two Dreyfusses.
SUPMALE:No, one Dreyfuss.
SUPMALE:I want to return the second, but I don't know how to tell which is which.
SUPFEMALE:That's where you come in.
LEADMALE:What do I do? Well, there's only one thing I can think of.
LEADFEMALE:We used to do it back on the farm, and I may be a little rusty, but it's worth a shot.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever it is, do it.
LEADMALE:I'm desperate.
SUPFEMALE:OK.
LEADFEMALE:Here goes.
SUPFEMALE:Dreyfuss, come here, boy! This one's Dreyfuss.
SUPFEMALE:I don't get it, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't like you.
LEADMALE:Come on, Gary calls at the last minute, cancels your date.
LEADFEMALE:You're not the least bit upset or suspicious.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Dorothy, give me some credit.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of person would doubt a man whose mother needs emergency gallbladder surgery to save her life? Besides, the hospital said the operation would take five hours, and that restaurant just would not hold our reservations past 8:30.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, Dorothy! I wasn't expecting you home till later.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I got off work early, and Blanche's plans were canceled.
OTHERFEMALE:So what are you up to tonight, Holly? Oh, nothing.
SUPMALE:Just a quiet evening at home.
LEADMALE:Where did those pants come from? According to the label, The Gap.
LEADMALE:Hold it, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you get it? Holly has company! Well! Nice going, girl.
SUPFEMALE:You're a pretty fast worker.
SUPMALE:I guess that's something we have in common.
SUPMALE:That's something else you have in common.
LEADFEMALE:Gary Tucker.
OTHERMALE:You miserable, no-good lowlife! You told me your mama was havin' surgery.
OTHERFEMALE:She is.
LEADMALE:Blanche, please let me explain.
SUPMALE:Why? So you can make up some cockamamie story about how you're two ships that passed in the night and it'll never happen again? Save your breath, I've heard all that before.
LEADFEMALE:You have? Yes, only usually I'm one of the ships.
LEADMALE:Well, Rose, it's all out in the open now.
LEADFEMALE:I can see that.
OTHERMALE:Holly, I'd like to speak with you in the kitchen, please.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, I'll just grab my pants and go.
SUPMALE:Holly Rose, I don't need a lecture.
OTHERFEMALE:It's over.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's not.
SUPMALE:I'll leave in the morning.
SUPFEMALE:Obviously, I won't be coming back.
SUPFEMALE:So that's where it ends? Well, that's neat, isn't it? You walk in here, borrow my friends for a while, then start acting like a stupid jerk and waltz right out as if nothing ever happened.
LEADFEMALE:Do you want an apology? I want an explanation.
SUPMALE:Holly, I can't figure you out.
SUPMALE:You're smart, you've got a career, you're attractive.
SUPFEMALE:Why do you always have to act like such a jackass? Maybe I just never learned to be the great person my big sister was.
LEADMALE:Oh, Holly.
SUPMALE:It's true, Rose.
SUPMALE:You always had the friends.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't.
LEADFEMALE:You had boyfriends, girlfriends.
LEADFEMALE:You were friends with every animal on the farm.
LEADFEMALE:I never learned how to make friends.
LEADMALE:You never learned how to keep friends.
LEADMALE:You never thought of anybody but yourself.
SUPMALE:It's about time you stopped looking around for other people to blame.
SUPMALE:This is your problem.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I always used to feel so guilty for not getting along with you, but that's over.
LEADMALE:Just because we're sisters doesn't mean we have to be friends.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd like to be someday, but you're gonna have to make the first move.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, Holly.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, are you all right? I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Rose, honey, can you ever forgive us? Well, it all depends.
LEADFEMALE:Will you believe what I say from now on, even if it isn't what you want to hear? Oh, of course we will.
LEADFEMALE:Will you believe me when I tell you that somebody isn't as nice as they seem? Of course we will.
LEADFEMALE:Will you believe me when I tell you about how our pig Lester always predicted the Best Supporting Actor Oscar winner every year since 19 Don't push it, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:OK, I forgive you.
LEADMALE:Oh, there he is.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been looking all over for that dog.
SUPFEMALE:Harry Weston just pulled up.
LEADFEMALE:Time for Dreyfuss to go home.
OTHERMALE:Now, see, that wasn't so bad, was it? No, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, he was very little trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, no trouble at all.
LEADMALE:Now come on, Dreyfuss, let's go.
LEADMALE:Yo, Dreyfuss! It's checkout time.
LEADMALE:He's acting as though Dreyfuss isn't even his name.
SUPMALE:Of course Dreyfuss is his name.
SUPMALE:Right, Dreyfuss? Dreyfuss! Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe we'll swing by the pet shop on the way home.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Girls, I am so excited.
LEADMALE:I just got a big bonus at work.
OTHERMALE:Ah! And guess what I've decided to do with it.
LEADFEMALE:What? I'm gonna have my breasts enlarged.
LEADMALE:You're not serious, Blanche? Oh, sure I am.
OTHERMALE:Breasts are back in fashion.
LEADMALE:And what God didn't give me, Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Myron Rosensweig will.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that man is the Picasso of plastic surgeons.
LEADMALE:Just be sure he doesn't attach one of them to your forehead.
OTHERMALE:Yes.
OTHERMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:What's shaking? Blanche's breasts.
LEADFEMALE:That's why she's gonna have 'em Shut up, Rose.
LEADMALE:Ma, I haven't seen you all morning.
LEADMALE:Where have you been? I went to see my friend Lillian.
LEADMALE:Lillian, at Shady Pines? Oh, you remember Shady Pines? That retirement home you stuck me in that resembled Sing Sing.
LEADMALE:My mistake, Sing Sing has a movie night.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, how is Lillian? I don't know.
LEADMALE:She wasn't there.
LEADFEMALE:There was someone else in her bed.
LEADMALE:It was weird.
OTHERFEMALE:Lillian? Oh, did you say Lillian? My God, you got a call about her this morning.
SUPMALE:I was so caught up in my breasts, I totally forgot.
LEADMALE:It happens to all of us, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:That's why my rent check was late.
LEADMALE:It's from your friend Gladys at Shady Pines.
LEADMALE:She says Lillian was sent to Sunny Pastures.
OTHERFEMALE:You see, Ma, your friend is fine.
SUPFEMALE:Fine? Are you kidding? Sunny Pastures is the worst nursing home in the city.
LEADFEMALE:It's every old person's nightmare.
LEADFEMALE:That, and a childproof cap on the Kaopectate bottle.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, if it's licensed by the state, your friend will be just fine there.
LEADFEMALE:You don't understand.
LEADMALE:It's where people wind up when they can't afford a place like Shady Pines.
LEADFEMALE:It's the bottom of the barrel.
SUPFEMALE:I have to see if Lillian is OK.
SUPMALE:What? Ma, wait.
LEADFEMALE:If it'll make you feel better, I'll take you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:Now while we're there, will you promise you'll hold my hand the entire time? Oh, Ma, are you really that scared? No.
LEADMALE:I just wanna make sure you're not grabbing at brochures behind my back.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose, hi.
LEADMALE:Listen, I just picked up these pamphlets at a cosmetic surgeon, and I want you to help me decide which alterations I'll get.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, none of these women have any tops on.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I know, honey.
LEADFEMALE:These are the "after" pictures of satisfied customers.
LEADMALE:I was thinking about having my breasts done like hers.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Blanche, but do you think black really suits you? I was talking about the shape.
SUPFEMALE:See, these are regal and dignified and upscale.
LEADMALE:And 50 percent off.
LEADMALE:Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Rosensweig over-ordered on the Vixen 3 model.
LEADMALE:Blanche, are you sure you're not being a bit silly? Why? Let me tell you something.
LEADFEMALE:When I was a schoolgirl, I developed early, and all the boys noticed and hit on me.
LEADMALE:Not one boy was ever interested in my mind.
OTHERMALE:Get outta here.
LEADFEMALE:It's true.
SUPMALE:But you, Blanche, I mean, men are drawn to you because of your charm and your wit and your zest for life.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you can have the operation or not.
LEADFEMALE:Men won't care one bit about your breasts.
SUPFEMALE:Really, Rose? Not with me around.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, girls.
LEADFEMALE:Did you all find Lillian? You bet we did.
LEADFEMALE:And that Sunny Pastures was everything that Ma said it would be.
OTHERFEMALE:And how.
LEADFEMALE:There was crud on the floor, rats in the hallway, and 60 people to every blanket.
OTHERMALE:It wasn't fit for human life.
LEADMALE:Although, in my village in Sicily, it would have been a two-star motel.
LEADMALE:Ma, you're exaggerating.
OTHERMALE:But not by much.
LEADMALE:It was pretty bad.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, when you hear horrible stories like that, it brings up so many questions.
LEADMALE:It sure does.
LEADMALE:Why do we let things like this happen? Why can't we care for our elderly the way they do in Japan? Why are there 17 sets of hooters on the coffee table? Those are mine, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, let me put on my big surprised face.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I just wish there was something we could do for the poor thing.
OTHERMALE:There is.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna sort of adopt Lillian, visit her often.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna need rides.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you can count on us, sweetheart.
OTHERFEMALE:You sure can.
LEADFEMALE:Absolutely.
LEADMALE:Now, come on, it's getting late.
SUPFEMALE:Let's get dinner, hmm? Notice how they seem to follow you wherever you go? This is it, Sophia? Well, this doesn't seem so bad.
LEADMALE:Believe me, you have to get into it more before you realize how bad it really is.
LEADMALE:Just like War and Remembrance.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, ladies, but visiting hours are over.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, then I guess we'll just come back No, we don't.
LEADFEMALE:We're not here to visit.
SUPFEMALE:We're not? No, we're here to see about checking in Mom.
SUPFEMALE:You two are sisters? Uh It's a long, involved, and somewhat sordid story.
SUPFEMALE:If you want to get a clearer picture, I suggest you rent the cassette of Chinatown.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, what's going on? It's a little surprise.
LEADFEMALE:We're not visiting Lillian as much as we're breaking her out.
OTHERMALE:What? We can't do that.
LEADMALE:I mean, that's wrong.
LEADMALE:What if we get caught? Lillian is a great friend.
LEADMALE:Will you do it, please? Well, OK.
OTHERFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:I'll keep the staff busy, you get Lillian.
SUPFEMALE:She's down the hall, last door on the right.
LEADMALE:Go.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:I'm John Porter.
LEADMALE:I'm in charge of admissions.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:I wanted to talk to you about my mother.
OTHERMALE:About checking her in? No, about her collection of commemorative plates.
SUPMALE:Of course about checking her in.
LEADMALE:She's 125.
LEADFEMALE:You can't pry the yogurt out of her hands.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I'll get the papers from my office.
LEADMALE:OK, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:Go where? That's not Lillian.
LEADMALE:You said you were Lillian.
OTHERFEMALE:You think I'm in here because I'm good with names? Rose, try again.
LEADMALE:She's in bed 68.
LEADMALE:Now hurry.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, honey.
LEADMALE:OK, let's fill this out.
LEADMALE:Uh, please.
LEADMALE:Um And you are? Sophia.
OTHERFEMALE:Sophia Pe Hawkins.
SUPFEMALE:OK, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Pehawkins, um Maybe you can tell me about your mother's history? Picture it.
LEADFEMALE:Sicily, 1900.
SUPFEMALE:An olive-skinned woman sets sail for the new world.
LEADFEMALE:I was talking about her medical history.
SUPMALE:So was I.
SUPFEMALE:You think that was a pleasure cruise? There was smallpox, scurvy, typhoid.
LEADFEMALE:And that was business class.
LEADFEMALE:What I need to know is, does your mother require any special medical care? She does.
SUPFEMALE:Uh An old war injury.
LEADFEMALE:Remember the Maine? She didn't.
LEADFEMALE:She was a frogman and swam right into the bulkhead.
SUPMALE:They put a metal plate in her head, and now she gets HBO through her eyeballs.
SUPFEMALE:Don't look at me like that.
LEADMALE:If Tyson has another fight, you may wanna set her up in the rec hall.
LEADFEMALE:This is all hard to believe.
LEADMALE:If it's not true, my name isn't Sophia Pehawkins.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, what the hell is going on? I ask for Lillian, you bring me Eubie Blake's parents.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong? They were the only other people back there.
SUPMALE:There is no way Lillian is in this ward.
SUPMALE:Hi, Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing here? Oh, Lillian.
SUPFEMALE:Thank God I found you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm taking you away from here.
LEADFEMALE:You are? How are we gonna get out? What about them? Leave it to a pro.
SUPFEMALE:Runaway wheelchair! Runaway wheelchair! Wait a minute! Come back here.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:How was your appointment with Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Rosensweig? Well, I was so nervous that I just rushed right in there and pulled off my top, and said, "Well, what do you think?" What did he say? He said, "I think you're probably looking for Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Rosensweig.
SUPFEMALE:" "But if you ever want a discount on life insurance, call me.
LEADFEMALE:" Oh, boy, do I need a cup of coffee.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter? Oh, this whole Lillian thing.
LEADMALE:The woman was up all night.
SUPMALE:Ma is exhausted.
LEADMALE:Oh, this is all my fault.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, well.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it.
SUPFEMALE:At least I called the home and checked her out for a week's visit.
LEADFEMALE:So we're not kidnappers anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, we need to talk about Lillian.
LEADMALE:I said I'll take care of her.
LEADFEMALE:Ma! I already take care of you three, so I'll do a little more cleaning, a little more cooking, and make up one more bed in the morning.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, you don't make my bed.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:It's impossible to put a fitted sheet around a big, hairy guy named Ed.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, everyone.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't it a lovely morning? It sure is, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:How about some pancakes? Again? We had pancakes yesterday.
OTHERFEMALE:Lillian, you weren't here yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:Here you are, honey.
LEADMALE:A nice cup of tea.
SUPMALE:Lillian, Sophia tells me that you were in the Ziegfeld Follies.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Those were the days.
LEADFEMALE:You must have been something.
LEADFEMALE:I was quite a looker.
LEADMALE:Almost as pretty as you.
LEADMALE:Why, thank you.
SUPMALE:Of course, I had bigger breasts.
LEADMALE:Sophia, do you think I could take a bath before breakfast? It's been a while.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me help.
SUPFEMALE:She's my friend.
LEADMALE:I wanna help her.
OTHERMALE:Oh, it's just wonderful to think about, isn't it, the two of 'em together? And they're so cute.
LEADFEMALE:Thinking about your breasts again, aren't you, Blanche?  I don't know this place.
SUPMALE:Lillian, it's OK.
LEADMALE:And I don't know you.
LEADFEMALE:Lillian, I'm Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:And this is Sophia.
OTHERMALE:We're your friends.
LEADMALE:We brought you here from the home last night.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, OK, right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Now, why don't you go and take that nice, hot bath? Come on, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:Ma, maybe you need a break.
LEADMALE:Why don't you sit this out? What? Like I can't handle it? Like it's too much for poor old Sophia.
SUPMALE:Like I'm so ancient, I don't have the energy.
OTHERMALE:Get the lights on your way out.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess it's my shift.
LEADMALE:It's OK, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I think she's finally asleep.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank God.
OTHERMALE:I am exhausted.
LEADMALE:I haven't been this tired since my wedding night.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, a night of unbridled passion should take it out of you.
SUPMALE:Who said anything about passion? I was tired from picking up beer cans from Stan's poker buddies.
OTHERFEMALE:I just cannot believe Lillian's only been here 24 hours.
LEADMALE:I cannot believe that Ma thought she could handle her alone.
LEADMALE:It's almost too much for the four of us.
LEADFEMALE:This just makes me so mad.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, people like this really need help.
LEADFEMALE:Then there are places like Sunny Pastures.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, there weren't any Sunny Pastures in the South.
LEADMALE:At least, not when I was growing up.
LEADMALE:I remember this one old man.
LEADMALE:His name was Ben.
LEADFEMALE:All he did all day long was sit out there on his family's front porch in that old hickory rocking chair and whittle.
OTHERMALE:Just whittle.
LEADMALE:I used to pass by there on my way home from school, and I'd say, "Hi, Ben.
OTHERMALE:" And he'd yell back, "Hi, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Stay away from my grandsons.
LEADFEMALE:" Anyway, I realized that Ben could spend all his days happy, whittling away, because his family was there for him.
OTHERMALE:I will never forget that look on his face.
LEADMALE:He was happier than a Kentucky yearling frolicking in blue grass as high as a hoot owl's perch on the top of a spring In English, Jethro! In English! He was happy.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, Ben got older, and I guess a little bit frail, and This is the hard part of my story.
LEADMALE:One autumn day, I walked by that porch and old Ben was gone.
LEADFEMALE:I bet he died in the bed he was born in.
LEADFEMALE:No, he was sent up the river on a morals charge.
OTHERMALE:Are you OK, Sophia? You're awfully quiet.
SUPFEMALE:What? Oh, it's just that talking about Lillian makes me think about the future.
SUPMALE:Oh, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, you have nothing to worry about.
SUPMALE:Who said I was talking about my future? You three aren't exactly spring chickens, you know.
SUPMALE:She's right.
OTHERFEMALE:One way or another, we're all in the same boat.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but right now, our big problem is Lillian.
SUPMALE:We obviously can't take care of her, and Sunny Pastures is not doing its job.
OTHERMALE:What are we gonna do? I know what I'm gonna do
LEADMALE:make Sunny Pastures do its job.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna see the man who runs that place and give him a good what for.
LEADMALE:I can be pretty mean and pretty tough when I want to be.
LEADFEMALE:There's only one thing I'll need.
SUPFEMALE:What, Dorothy? My mother to come with me.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:I have the purchase order right here in front of me.
LEADMALE:This was your mistake, and we're not paying for it.
LEADMALE:Problems, problems, problems.
LEADFEMALE:The world is bringing me problems.
SUPFEMALE:And you are? We are the world.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
SUPFEMALE:This is my mother Sophia.
LEADMALE:We're here to talk to you  Hello.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, I did not order It was 40 bedpans.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:You were telling me? What we wanted to talk to you  Sorry.
SUPMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:Tell 'em to drop it off at the south end loading dock.
OTHERMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:It's always like this.
SUPMALE:You were saying? Mrs.
LEADMALE:Zbornak? Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I just figured if I opened my mouth that the phone would start ringing.
LEADMALE:Anyway, what I  That's OK.
SUPMALE:I'll just let it ring.
LEADFEMALE:We're here because we have a very dear friend who is a patient here, and we have some concerns.
LEADMALE:She's a lovely old woman, very sweet and very kind, and we would really hope that in some way, you know, you could Dammit! Will you answer the phone? Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Bill the insurance company first.
LEADFEMALE:The state takes care of the rest.
LEADMALE:So, you have some concerns about Sunny Pastures? Actually, they're more like complaints.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, complaints? Oh, well What you need to do is fill out these forms and mail them back to me.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, and then what happens? Then it goes right here into my inbox.
SUPMALE:This is outrageous.
LEADFEMALE:Lillian's problems cannot wait that long.
OTHERFEMALE:She is old, she is sick, and she needs better care right now.
SUPFEMALE:I agree.
SUPMALE:What? Look, ladies, Sunny Pastures doesn't operate at a profit.
LEADFEMALE:Our patients' social security and Medicare pay most of our bills.
LEADFEMALE:The government subsidies pick up the slack so we can meet minimum standards.
SUPMALE:Then maybe minimum standards aren't enough.
LEADFEMALE:Right again.
LEADMALE:And this year, the government's made cutbacks.
LEADMALE:We're operating in the red and doing the best we can.
LEADFEMALE:Are you telling me that nothing can be done? Look, I'd love to help your friend.
SUPMALE:I'd love to help all our patients.
LEADMALE:And if you have any ideas on how to make it better, I'm all ears.
LEADMALE:  Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Well, girls, how did it go? Terrible.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you live and wind up in a place like Sunny Pastures.
SUPFEMALE:I guess money makes the world go round.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you live 80, 90 years, just getting up too fast makes the world go round.
LEADMALE:Hi, everyone.
SUPFEMALE:Where's Lillian? I have some really good news.
OTHERMALE:She's napping.
LEADFEMALE:What news? Well, I spent the day going around town, and I think I found the perfect place for her.
LEADMALE:Really? Well, it's not as nice as Shady Pines, but the staff really seems to care, and the patients are happy.
LEADMALE:Rose, that is fantastic.
LEADFEMALE:And it won't cost any more than Sunny Pastures? Well, that's the one little problem.
LEADMALE:Lillian's benefits won't quite cover the costs.
SUPFEMALE:She'll need another $150 a month.
SUPMALE:Little problem? Rose, how could you get our hopes up like that? I mean, who has an extra $150 a month? I do.
SUPMALE:What? I do! We'll use that bonus check I got at work.
LEADMALE:But, Blanche Don't try and talk me out of it, now.
OTHERMALE:My mind is made up.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, are you sure? Sure, I'm sure.
LEADFEMALE:Lillian ought to be covered for two years with that money in my bosom account.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I'm proud of you.
SUPFEMALE:But why the sudden change of heart? Oh, well.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess this cosmetic surgery business is pretty trivial, really.
SUPFEMALE:I'll do fine with what God gave me.
LEADMALE:Having Lillian here made me realize that my problems are pretty trite.
OTHERFEMALE:I suppose something like this does make your breasts seem rather small.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, sort of.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then.
LEADMALE:That's that.
SUPFEMALE:Lillian's problems are solved.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't this terrific? Terrific? Ma, this is wonderful.
LEADMALE:I mean, this is a real happy ending.
OTHERMALE:So, how come I don't feel all that happy? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Is it because we know that Lillian's just plain lucky? That a lot of old people do slip through the cracks and are forgotten? And maybe it may not be too long until we're elderly ourselves? I know, girls.
SUPFEMALE:Let's make a pact that we'll always take care of each other.
LEADFEMALE:That we'll never desert each other, no matter what.
LEADMALE:You can count on me, honey.
LEADMALE:Do you think it's gonna be that easy getting rid of me, Rose? That was rhetorical, Rose.
SUPMALE:Ah, but what a comforting thought, knowing you'll never be alone.
OTHERFEMALE:And listen, what the hell? If we do have to go to a nursing home, let's all go together.
LEADMALE:But what happens when there's only one of us left? Don't worry.
LEADMALE:I can take care of myself.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:What are you eating? Ziti.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, it's nine o'clock in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:You're eating a bowl of pasta? No, I'm eating a bowl of Nabisco Zitios.
LEADFEMALE:Of course I'm eating pasta.
LEADMALE:I need to gain weight.
LEADFEMALE:I'm wasting away, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? I got weighed this morning.
OTHERMALE:I couldn't believe what I saw.
SUPMALE:98lbs.
SUPMALE:What do you usually weigh? Ma, you lost one pound.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, RenÃ© Descartes.
LEADMALE:I'm looking for advice, not arithmetic.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, you cannot get upset over one pound.
LEADMALE:Maybe you can't.
SUPFEMALE:I can.
SUPFEMALE:For 50 years my weight hasn't changed by an ounce, and as far as I'm concerned, until I'm back to 99, I'm no longer Sophia Petrillo.
LEADMALE:Morning, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Morning, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Who? Dorothy, do you realize it's only two weeks till Phyllis's Memorial Day beach party? There's only two weeks till we have to get back into bathing suits again.
SUPMALE:Well, I just slipped into last year's bikini and I think I look pretty good, but you give me your honest advice.
LEADFEMALE:Can I still pull it off? Right now I'd be surprised if you could cut if off.
LEADMALE:Are you implying that I might have gained weight? There's only one way to find out.
LEADFEMALE:Here's the scale.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, fine.
LEADMALE:Whoa! Sophia, were you looking? Uh, no, not till you stepped off.
LEADMALE:But I know it's not a good sign when the first rebound goes into the low 120s.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, honey, don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:All you need is a little spring tune-up.
LEADMALE:And I suppose you don't? No, not really.
SUPMALE:Prove it.
LEADFEMALE:Put your money where your mouth is.
SUPMALE:If there isn't already a sweet roll there.
OTHERMALE:All right, all right, but, now, nobody look.
SUPMALE:I always thought you had to pass zero to hit that number.
SUPMALE:Obviously the scale is broken.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not surprised after that kind of punishment.
LEADMALE:Rose, you think you're so tiny, why don't you get weighed? Oh, I don't need to.
LEADMALE:I never gain weight.
SUPMALE:Show us, Rose.
LEADMALE:Well, OK, but I can promise you I weigh exactly the same as I did on my wedding day.
SUPFEMALE:Moo! Obviously we all need to lose a few pounds.
LEADMALE:We might as well start right now.
SUPFEMALE:It's still two weeks until Phyllis's party.
LEADMALE:Oh, but how? We could try another health club.
LEADMALE:Oh, no way, Rose.
LEADMALE:I'm sure you haven't forgotten what happened that time we tried that.
LEADFEMALE:Remember the outfits we ended up with? Oh, Lord have mercy.
LEADFEMALE:This seems like a nice club.
OTHERMALE:But it's for women only.
SUPFEMALE:What's wrong with the nice coed gym we just saw? Come on now, Blanche, that was nothing but a pickup scene.
LEADMALE:People running around in skimpy outfits, collecting phone numbers.
SUPMALE:That's not true.
LEADFEMALE:I was not in a skimpy outfit and I got all these.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:My name is Yvonne.
SUPFEMALE:Have you been here before? See? You go to a woman's gym, you get hit on by a woman.
LEADFEMALE:I work here.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't mean to imply anything.
SUPFEMALE:She just thought you were a lesbian.
LEADMALE:Yvonne, we want to join a gym.
LEADMALE:What kind of exercise are you interested in? Nothing radical, just to lose a few pounds Tone up.
OTHERFEMALE:Slim down.
LEADMALE:Get into my summer wardrobe.
LEADMALE:Get into my winter wardrobe.
OTHERFEMALE:Get into my bathrobe.
LEADMALE:Yvonne, we are desperate women.
LEADMALE:You've got to help us.
LEADMALE:I know just what you need.
SUPFEMALE:Aerobics.
LEADFEMALE:It's what I do.
LEADMALE:But, Yvonne, you're much younger than they are.
SUPFEMALE:I know you'll love aerobics.
LEADFEMALE:It stretches every muscle in your body.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, I've been stretching this body for years.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, sticking your feet out of the sunroof of a Chrysler New Yorker doesn't count.
OTHERMALE:We have a beginners' class starting in 15 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:With some hard work, your body can look as good as mine.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:We better get you some outfits.
OTHERMALE:Oh, it's OK.
SUPMALE:We brought our sweats.
SUPMALE:Sweats? Look, ladies, if you're serious about training, you want to get off on the right foot, starting with good workout shoes.
SUPMALE:Now, these are beautiful, and a bargain at $85.
OTHERMALE:$85? That's a bit exorbitant.
LEADMALE:And expensive too.
LEADFEMALE:We do have cheaper brands, but anyone who's serious wouldn't even go near them.
SUPFEMALE:Then we'll take those.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:You'll also need aerobic suits, warmup outfits, wristbands, headbands, leg warmers.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Leg warmers? You need to keep your thighs warm.
LEADFEMALE:What are you using now? Friction.
LEADFEMALE:That's why we're here.
LEADMALE:Ladies, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:When you told me you were serious, I took you literally.
OTHERFEMALE:Just forget this stuff.
LEADMALE:Wear your sweats.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, Yvonne.
LEADFEMALE:We want all that stuff.
OTHERMALE:We do.
SUPFEMALE:We really do.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna stick with my sweat suit and my PF Flyers.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you girls in the locker room.
LEADFEMALE:Yvonne, she's not serious.
SUPMALE:Never has been, never will be.
OTHERFEMALE:OK, then you'll need new gym bags, water bottles, vitamin packs, and most importantly, a sports training bra to minimize jiggle and bounce.
SUPFEMALE:Yvonne, honey, I think you're missing the whole point of having breasts.
LEADMALE:We'll take them.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Nice outfits, girls.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Yvonne and this is it! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo.
LEADMALE:OK, everybody, let's warm up.
SUPFEMALE:Whoo! Whoo! And stretch.
LEADFEMALE:Legs wider.
OTHERMALE:Oh, ow.
LEADFEMALE:That hurts.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not having any trouble.
OTHERMALE:Why is it that doesn't surprise me? OK, everybody on their feet.
LEADFEMALE:Whirlybirds.
LEADFEMALE:Whirlybirds.
LEADMALE:Jackhammer.
OTHERFEMALE:Jackhammer.
LEADMALE:Windshield wipers.
LEADFEMALE:Windshield wipers.
LEADMALE:Charley horse.
LEADMALE:Charley horse.
LEADMALE:She has a cramp, you pea brain.
LEADMALE:All that money and we only went twice.
LEADMALE:Can you believe it? What are you cooking now, Ma? A Petrillo family delicacy.
LEADFEMALE:Double-fudge, amaretto, ricotta cheesecake.
LEADMALE:What's in it? This cake is guaranteed to make me gain back that pound.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, all this eating you're doing is ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I am sure you are already back up to 99lbs.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll see.
OTHERFEMALE:Wrong again, Kreskin.
LEADFEMALE:Still 98.
LEADMALE:I can't remember the last time I weighed 98.
SUPMALE:Probably college.
SUPFEMALE:Where'd you go to college, Blanche? The University of Jupiter? Girls, we still have one big problem to solve.
LEADMALE:How are we gonna make ourselves look good for the party? How else, Rose? By dieting.
LEADMALE:It's gonna take a little patience and a little determination, but mostly it's gonna take willpower.
LEADFEMALE:We are facing some long, painful, hunger pang filled nights.
SUPFEMALE:Who wants to lick the spoon? I do.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we could just change our hairdos.
LEADMALE:Now, we cannot do that, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I'm still trying to recover from the last time.
LEADMALE:Remember, about the same time of year
LEADFEMALE:two years ago, was it? That little dinky place.
LEADMALE:Gee, Ma, I don't know if this was such a good idea.
SUPFEMALE:I think you're right.
SUPMALE:Maybe I should've done my own hair.
LEADFEMALE:I've been doing it for years.
LEADFEMALE:That's why it looks like something you buy on a stick at halftime.
LEADMALE:Sophia, we're just a little bit nervous.
OTHERFEMALE:This is a very important event.
LEADFEMALE:We want to look perfect.
LEADMALE:Please! The man works with scissors, not a sandblaster.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, this is all a mistake.
SUPFEMALE:We don't belong here.
LEADMALE:This is one of those Miami Beach shops for little old ladies.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, let's get out of her All right, ladies.
SUPMALE:Whose hair do I wash next? Mine.
LEADMALE:I'm first.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the dirtiest.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, God, you are gorgeous.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I know.
LEADFEMALE:I am Eduardo.
LEADFEMALE:Eduardo, tonight is important to us.
SUPFEMALE:We want to look our best.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, ladies.
LEADMALE:After Eduardo does a woman's hair, the years melt away.
LEADFEMALE:She's transformed into a breathtaking, sensuous, vivacious goddess of beauty.
SUPMALE:I tried to get all that on the sign, but they charge by the letter.
LEADFEMALE:We should begin by your telling me what you would like.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:I have a picture.
LEADFEMALE:This is not you.
LEADMALE:You are a vixen.
OTHERFEMALE:For you, I see a saucier cut.
LEADFEMALE:An Audrey Hepburn look.
LEADMALE:Simple, elegant, and something to accent these delicate features.
LEADFEMALE:Can you really do all that? My dear, in many respects, styling hair is like making love.
LEADFEMALE:To do it well, one must have trust, respect and a chair you can pump up and down.
OTHERMALE:I am your clay.
LEADMALE:Mold me.
LEADMALE:Not so fast, Eduardo.
LEADFEMALE:What are you going to do with me? You have good bones.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, this is a strong, noble face, full of wisdom and sincerity.
LEADMALE:You could be a Greek goddess.
LEADFEMALE:Go on, Eduardo.
LEADFEMALE:I said go on, Eduardo.
LEADFEMALE:Give him a break.
LEADMALE:He barely got it out once with a straight face.
SUPFEMALE:What about me? Could I be a goddess too? No, no.
LEADFEMALE:You are an earth mother.
LEADMALE:Sweet, compassionate, but bubbling with sensuality just below the surface.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's a relief.
LEADMALE:All this time I thought it was gas.
SUPFEMALE:Ladies, it's time.
SUPMALE:Time to walk through the looking glass.
LEADMALE:Time to take that last glimpse of your former selves.
LEADFEMALE:Time to take that giant step into the world of Eduardoism.
LEADMALE:You've been drinking again, haven't you? Right.
SUPFEMALE:The magic begins.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm feeling younger and sexier already.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, how do I look? Like something that came out of the air duct of the starship Enterprise.
SUPFEMALE:What? What? Ladies, it's time.
SUPFEMALE:Time for the unveiling of another Eduardo masterpiece.
LEADFEMALE:Sit back, feast your eyes, and meet the woman you always dreamt you could be.
OTHERMALE:Eduardo, you've done it again.
LEADMALE:And again.
SUPMALE:And again.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, I still cannot believe you talked us into that.
LEADMALE:Please.
LEADMALE:You three looked gorgeous.
SUPFEMALE:We didn't even look like ourselves.
SUPMALE:What's your point? Ma, you are not helping matters.
LEADFEMALE:We are trying to think of a way we can make ourselves look better for that party.
SUPMALE:OK, let me think.
LEADFEMALE:It's too bad we're not back home.
OTHERFEMALE:There's no place like Sicily.
OTHERFEMALE:Why do you say that, Sophia? Because in Sicily I could solve this with one phone call.
SUPFEMALE:To whom? Nicodemo the Ugly.
SUPMALE:Whenever you wanted to look gorgeous at a party, you hired him to be your date.
LEADMALE:You mean women paid him to stand next to them at parties and look disgusting? Please.
LEADFEMALE:They paid through the nose.
LEADFEMALE:That's also how he usually gave them their change.
SUPFEMALE:Girls, maybe we don't even need to worry about our bodies.
LEADFEMALE:At the counseling center, we teach people that changing their dispositions can sometimes be just as effective in making a good impression.
SUPMALE:Rose, if you're thinking of one of those personality-enhancing exercises, you're forgetting we tried that already once too.
OTHERMALE:And I'll never try that again.
LEADFEMALE:Remember? Three years ago.
OTHERFEMALE:It seems like yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:Damn! What's the matter, Pussycat? I can't balance my checkbook.
LEADMALE:Oh, to hell with it.
LEADMALE:I'm only off by a few pennies.
SUPFEMALE:A few pennies.
LEADMALE:To you it may not be much, but in Sicily a few pennies could make the difference between owning a gun and having to insert bullets into your victim manually.
LEADMALE:OK, Ma, I'll try it again, but believe me,  there's nothing in this world I hate more.
LEADMALE:I spoke too soon.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, babe.
LEADMALE:It's me, Stan.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, let me rephrase that.
SUPMALE:It's me, the new Stan.
OTHERMALE:What are you talking about? Don't you notice a difference? Can't you see the glow? Can't you see the light radiating off me? Sure.
SUPMALE:It's the porch light glaring off your head.
SUPMALE:I thought I heard a man's voi Oh, it's you, Stan.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so happy you're all here.
LEADFEMALE:I have just had an incredible experience that I wanted to share with my dearest friends.
LEADMALE:So what are you doing here? I just finished a seminar with an encounter group called Realizations.
SUPMALE:Realizations.
LEADMALE:Let me guess.
SUPFEMALE:It's a group that promises to remove all emotional blocks, self-denial and lifelong hang-ups in two days.
OTHERMALE:Miss Know-It-All, for your information it takes three days.
LEADFEMALE:So what did it do for you? I've learned a hell of a lot about what makes Stanley run.
LEADMALE:Why I'm so reluctant to make commitments, why I can't keep friends, why all my business ventures seem to fail.
LEADFEMALE:I finally have an answer.
SUPMALE:Because you're a schmuck? Did you take this seminar? Stan, I think we've heard enough.
LEADMALE:Look, I've gone through a life-changing experience.
SUPMALE:I feel like I'm free to love anybody.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please.
LEADFEMALE:You said the same thing after you had your vasectomy.
LEADFEMALE:That's OK.
SUPMALE:In Realizations, I learnt that people usually hurt each other unintentionally, therefore they deserve a second chance.
SUPFEMALE:I hate you.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing can bother me.
LEADMALE:Not now.
LEADMALE:I'm in a fellowship that accepts me, cares for me and loves me.
OTHERFEMALE:They'll always be there for me, and I'd like to enroll all of you in that fellowship.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:But you've got to.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Because if I don't meet my quota for enrolling new people in this loving, accepting, caring fellowship, they're gonna kick me out on the street and never speak to me again.
SUPMALE:Please.
SUPMALE:At least hear me out.
LEADMALE:All right, Stanley.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll listen to what you have to say.
OTHERMALE:Beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:How about we all go someplace and get comfortable, get some coffee, have something to eat? I'll go change.
LEADMALE:Why? We're only going into the kitchen.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, I hope you have some cheesecake.
SUPMALE:Stan, that's it.
LEADMALE:I've had it with your freeloading.
SUPMALE:Get out.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, you have so much hostility, so much aggression, so much mistrust.
OTHERMALE:This problem goes deeper than I thought.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna need a steak with that cheesecake.
SUPFEMALE:Get out! Dorothy Out! I'll just leave you the brochure.
OTHERMALE:Can you believe that man? He actually thought he was gonna help us.
LEADMALE:Well, he did have one good idea.
LEADFEMALE:What was that? Cheesecake.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Dorothy, to this day I cannot understand what you saw in that man.
OTHERMALE:Picture a man 20lbs lighter, long, wavy hair, rippling muscles.
LEADMALE:I can't believe Stan looked like that.
LEADMALE:He didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think if I ever met a man who looked like that, I would've married Stan? Maybe we shouldn't be so tough on the guy.
LEADMALE:This brochure actually looks interesting, once you get past the picture of the guy in the turban waving from the front seat of the Rolls-Royce.
OTHERMALE:Sophia, those things are just silly.
SUPFEMALE:"The unexamined life is a life not worth living.
LEADFEMALE:" That's very deep.
OTHERFEMALE:And if you're into this, very reasonable.
LEADFEMALE:It's 17.
OTHERFEMALE:95 for that slogan printed on a turban-shaped night-light.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that is so typical.
LEADFEMALE:All those swamis are just out for a buck.
SUPMALE:They can't teach you anything that anyone with any common sense doesn't already know.
LEADMALE:I didn't know that.
LEADFEMALE:A visual aid.
LEADMALE:Oh, really, Ramdas? If it's all so easy, let's hear you answer this question.
SUPMALE:"Describe your best friend.
SUPMALE:" Dorothy, that's a really good question.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, and I'd love to hear the answer.
SUPFEMALE:Well, my best friend is a woman, someone I have a great deal in common with.
LEADFEMALE:Is she pretty? Yes, she's attractive.
LEADFEMALE:Attractive as in wholesome? Or attractive as in drop-dead stunningly gorgeous? Attractive as in attractive.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:What else? She's someone I share my innermost secrets with in strictest confidence.
SUPMALE:You mean like the time you told me you borrowed Blanche's car, dented it, and said the bag boy at the grocery store did it? That's not a secret.
SUPMALE:I just forgot to mention it.
SUPFEMALE:I think she means more like the time she told me that she went skinny-dipping with your cousin Lars before he gave up the pulpit back in St.
LEADMALE:Gustave.
SUPMALE:That's a better example of a secret.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, then you have been talking about me.
SUPMALE:I'm your best friend.
SUPFEMALE:She's been talking about me, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I haven't been talking about either one of you.
LEADFEMALE:What? I've been talking about both of you.
LEADMALE:I mean, how could I chose between you two? You're both my best friends.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, how sweet.
SUPMALE:Oh, that just gives me a warm, tingly feeling all over.
LEADMALE:If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go slip under the covers and enjoy it.
LEADMALE:OK, Dorothy, she's gone.
OTHERFEMALE:You can tell me the truth.
LEADFEMALE:You were talking about me, weren't you? That's OK.
SUPFEMALE:It'll be our own little secret.
LEADMALE:That, and the dent in Blanche's car.
OTHERMALE:Got you.
SUPFEMALE:You are such a liar.
LEADFEMALE:What? Neither of them is your best friend.
SUPMALE:Admit it.
LEADMALE:I'm your best friend.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:I was talking about you, Ma.
LEADMALE:You are my best friend.
LEADMALE:Just like I'm your best friend.
SUPFEMALE:Best friend? Please.
SUPFEMALE:You aren't even my favorite child.
OTHERMALE:When you were 13, there were neighbor children I liked better.
LEADMALE:Best friend.
OTHERFEMALE:How about picking up a tab once in a while, pal of mine? Or letting me open my own social security check? Best friend! Yeah, right.
SUPFEMALE:That little exercise certainly did not enhance things around here.
LEADMALE:Oh, I wouldn't say that.
LEADFEMALE:After Ma blabbed the truth, you turned the silent treatment into an art form.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, there's my cake.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma.
LEADMALE:Now, you cannot eat cake after that big bowl of pasta.
LEADMALE:It's not healthy.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, I just thought of something.
SUPMALE:You're worried about losing a pound.
OTHERFEMALE:Have you ever thought you may not be the same height you always were? You know, Ma, Blanche could be right.
SUPFEMALE:This could be exactly why you're losing weight.
LEADFEMALE:Come with me.
LEADFEMALE:Remember the first week you were here, we put a mark on the back wall to measure how tall we were? You said they did that at the home to show how your height was declining.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche is right.
LEADMALE:You are a little bit shorter.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to worry about losing weight.
OTHERFEMALE:And you don't have to eat that cake.
LEADFEMALE:Why do I get the feeling you three are most happy about the last part? Oh, you mean us have some cake? Honey, we can't do that.
LEADFEMALE:We're dieting.
LEADFEMALE:Sure smells good though.
OTHERMALE:Looks even better.
LEADMALE:Bet you it tastes even better than that.
OTHERFEMALE:You three are dieting.
LEADFEMALE:I'm throwing it away.
SUPFEMALE:Don't! Oh, girls, we can't do this.
LEADMALE:Now, remember the party.
LEADFEMALE:It's two weeks from Saturday.
LEADFEMALE:No, it isn't.
SUPFEMALE:This year Phyllis moved it to Sunday.
SUPFEMALE:Then we have an extra day.
SUPFEMALE:We can worry about our bodies tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get the plates.
LEADMALE:I'll get the forks.
LEADMALE:I'll get the hot fudge.
OTHERMALE:I'll get the butter.
OTHERFEMALE:We may have to grease the doorway to get the three of you out of here.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Dorothy, give me a seven-letter word which 
LEADMALE:"lonely, middle-aged woman desperate to meet men.
LEADFEMALE:" Is that a clue on your crossword puzzle? No, I'm getting you a personalized license plate for your car.
LEADMALE:Here you go, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, have you ever heard of something called dirty-dancing? Well, of course, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:They did it in that movie.
SUPMALE:What movie? Lawrence of Arabia, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:This flier that came in the mail says they're gonna start a dirty-dancing course down at Lawson's dance studio.
LEADMALE:What do you say, Dorothy? Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:I can't see myself swinging my hips and wildly gyrating my pelvis.
LEADFEMALE:I am not interested.
LEADMALE:And the world heaves a collective sigh of relief.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, how about you? You wanna learn dirty-dancing? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:For some odd reason, dirty-dancing always sounds dirty.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Rose.
LEADMALE:You know you like dancing.
LEADFEMALE:I like square-dancing.
LEADFEMALE:This is just like square-dancing.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, count me in.
SUPMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Just one thing.
SUPFEMALE:When you do-si-do, your legs are wrapped around your partner's neck.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, look.
SUPFEMALE:It's a letter from my friends Philomena and Dominic Bosco in Sicily.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:They're visiting Miami with their daughter Gina.
LEADMALE:Who are they? Oh, well, Gina and I were born within minutes of each other at the same hospital in Brooklyn.
LEADFEMALE:That's when Ma became friendly with Philomena, before the family moved back to Sicily.
LEADMALE:Will the Boscos be staying with us, Sophia? Unless there's a bidding war with the neighbors.
SUPMALE:Well, even if we lose, at least they'll be close by.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:They won't be any trouble.
SUPFEMALE:They'll all stay in my room.
SUPMALE:Oh, Ma.
LEADMALE:Three people in one bed? What'll the Boscos say? If you throw in a goat, they'll say, "This is just like home.
LEADMALE:" Hi, Ma.
OTHERMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna know what you think of my pasta pesto.
LEADMALE:It's for the Boscos.
LEADFEMALE:They'll be here any minute.
SUPMALE:Ma, this is awful.
OTHERMALE:I'm also boiling the crud off the sink stop.
SUPMALE:Try the other pot.
SUPMALE:Hello, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Hi, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Tell me, how did the class go? Oh, not so bad, really, although it was harder than I'd expected, but I'm sure that in time I'll be able to master the technique and absorb the subtleties.
LEADMALE:She stunk.
LEADFEMALE:But the teacher said I was a natural.
LEADMALE:Let me get this straight.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche couldn't get the hang of dirty-dancing but you could? Dorothy, now do you see why I'm so embarrassed? Can you imagine a dance with movements just like making love, and I can't do it? Relax, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe standing up is what's throwing you.
LEADMALE:There are the Boscos.
SUPFEMALE:Philomena! Sophia! Oh! Oh!  Oh! Oh! Oh, this is such a warm, wonderful moment.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I just wish I spoke Italian so I'd know what they were saying.
LEADFEMALE:So good to see you, Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:So good to see Oh! And this must be Dorotea.
OTHERMALE:You know, you probably don't remember, but over 50 years ago I held you naked in my arms.
LEADFEMALE:And you peed on his suit.
LEADMALE:It's OK.
LEADFEMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:You can hardly see it anymore.
OTHERMALE:Oh, let me introduce my friends.
OTHERFEMALE:This is Rose and Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what a charming old world couple.
LEADMALE:Welcome to Miami.
SUPMALE:Questa mi sembra una donna di strada.
OTHERFEMALE:What did she say? Er, she says she wants to thank you for your gracious welcome.
LEADMALE:Oh, my Italian must really be rusty.
OTHERFEMALE:I could swear she asked if you were a streetwalker.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell me, where, uh, where is Gina? Isn't she with you? She's outside.
LEADMALE:She's bartering with the cabby, you know.
SUPMALE:Imagine a man who take cash over a rooster.
LEADFEMALE:Well, tell us, now, what brings you all to Florida? Well, we are here to take our daughter back to Sicily for her wedding.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but Gina came with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Gina is not our daughter.
LEADMALE:She's not? No.
LEADFEMALE:You are our daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Please, ignore him.
SUPFEMALE:The man spent 90 days on the high seas drinking grain alcohol from a goat bladder.
SUPFEMALE:Dominic speak the truth.
SUPMALE:After Gina take a blood test for her marriage we find out it is not possible she is related to us.
SUPFEMALE:At the hospital there must have been some mix-up.
OTHERFEMALE:You mean they switched the babies? Oh, but this is ridiculous.
LEADMALE:Absolutely.
SUPFEMALE:We can prove it.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, show 'em your driver's license.
LEADMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I know this is a shock, but it gets better.
SUPMALE:You are getting married.
LEADMALE:To the most handsome man in the village.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:There is not one shred of evidence, not one logical reason, why I should not believe that this woman is my mother or that Gina is her real daughter.
OTHERFEMALE:Buongiorno.
SUPMALE:I'm Gina.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma, that's disgusting.
SUPMALE:Can't you find a better place to clip your toenails? Don't call me Ma.
OTHERMALE:Call me Sophia like my other friends.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Ma, I am very upset, so please stop teasing me.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, I've never told this to anyone before.
LEADMALE:The day I left the hospital with you, I had a gnawing feeling in the pit of my stomach.
LEADMALE:Because you suspected I wasn't your daughter? No, because I was in labor for 38 hours.
SUPFEMALE:And the doctor bought his obstetric tools from a restaurant supply store.
SUPFEMALE:Now, stop talking crazy and go to bed.
SUPMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, you got a cough drop? No.
OTHERMALE:A hard candy? No.
SUPMALE:A Tic Tac? Does it say Kmart on the back of my nightgown? As a matter of fact, it does, you cheapskate.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Ma, I remember when I was a little girl-- Oh, God.
SUPFEMALE:I used to have these terrible nightmares
LEADFEMALE:monsters in the closet
LEADMALE:and you'd always let me sleep in your room.
OTHERMALE:You remember, Ma? And I remember how you and Pop would get me to stop crying.
LEADMALE:You'd put your arms around me and kiss me and 
LEADMALE:"As long as you're in my arms, everything's gonna be OK.
OTHERMALE:" Ma, that's what I need now.
SUPFEMALE:A parent to hug me and tell me everything's gonna be OK.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Everything is gonna be molto bene.
SUPFEMALE:What the hell is going on here? I heard your voice in the hallway.
OTHERFEMALE:I wanted to see why my bambina was up so late.
LEADFEMALE:Don't call me your bambina.
OTHERFEMALE:Dominic, you wake the bambina! Stop saying that! Don't raise your voice at your mama.
SUPFEMALE:You're not too old for me to take you across my knee.
LEADFEMALE:You lay a finger on me, your teeth will be back in Sicily before you are.
LEADFEMALE:That's my girl! You've got lots of spirit just like your beautiful mama.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:This has gone far enough.
SUPMALE:What's gone far enough? I was talking to her.
SUPFEMALE:Look, from now on she'll be Ma number one.
LEADFEMALE:You're Ma number two I'm slowly going out of my mind.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Enough.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow I'll go to the hospital and have a blood test and settle this whole mess once and for all.
SUPMALE:Capeesh? Now, go to bed.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank heaven this'll all be settled tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I love you, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Ma.
SUPMALE:Ma? Are you talking to me? But Blanche-- Don't even speak to me.
SUPFEMALE:What you did was terrible.
LEADFEMALE:I've never been so humiliated in my entire life.
LEADFEMALE:That's not true.
LEADMALE:What about the time you got caught with the Orkin man? Don't comfort me, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:All right, girls.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? Blanche and I went dancing.
LEADFEMALE:She was sure she could out-dirty-dance me, even though I am better in class, so we went to a club.
LEADMALE:Well, I got up first, and I was pretty good and then Blanche got up.
SUPMALE:And she was bad? Well, I couldn't tell.
OTHERFEMALE:I was blinded by the reflection off some gold chains on a guy named Mick.
OTHERFEMALE:But I think the laughter spoke for itself.
LEADFEMALE:That's enough, Rose.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, what are you doing up? Oh, I couldn't sleep.
SUPMALE:I just keep thinking about Ma and whose mother she really is.
LEADFEMALE:You're worried she might be Gina's? No, I'm worried she might be Phil Rizzuto's.
LEADFEMALE:I've noticed the phrase "holy cow" creeping into her conversation a lot.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Dorothy, you have nothing to worry about.
SUPMALE:Blanche, of course I do.
SUPMALE:I am confronting the possibility that the woman I have lived with and known and loved for my entire life may not even be my mother.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, that's exactly the point.
LEADFEMALE:What's the difference if she did or didn't give birth to you? You two really know each other and you really love each other
OTHERFEMALE:a lot more than most mommas and their children ever do.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing that has happened or will happen can ever change that.
SUPFEMALE: Of course, I could be wrong.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
OTHERFEMALE:Would you like a cup of coffee? Oh, no, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:The vending machine gave me two by mistake.
LEADMALE:Hospitals.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing ever works the way it's supposed to.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Just because a hospital vending machine screws up a lousy cup of coffee doesn't mean the hospital did anything wrong.
LEADMALE:Oh, sure, a mistake like getting two babies mixed up makes the headlines.
OTHERMALE:But the point is
LEADMALE:statistics back me up
LEADFEMALE:hospitals are remarkably efficient institutions.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, seriously.
LEADFEMALE:How often does a hospital mix up two babies? Have you ever heard of such a thing? Well, have you? Are you here for the methadone program? I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm here for my mother.
LEADFEMALE:Surgery? No.
LEADMALE:Blood test.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:You? I have someone going into surgery.
SUPMALE:I can understand why you'd be a little nervous.
LEADMALE:No matter how many times you have to go through something like this, I guess you're never really prepared for it.
SUPFEMALE:Look at me.
LEADMALE:My hands are shaking.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sweating.
SUPFEMALE:My head is spinning.
SUPMALE:I wish I could be only a little nervous.
SUPMALE:Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Watkins to OR.
LEADMALE:Dr.
LEADMALE:Watkins to OR.
LEADMALE:Well, that's me.
SUPMALE:I have to run.
OTHERMALE:Ma, what took you so long? All they did was draw a little blood.
LEADMALE:At my age, that's like wildcat-drilling for oil.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, when are you gonna get the results of the blood test? I'm a nervous wreck.
LEADMALE:It'll only take a few minutes.
LEADMALE:Relax, would ya? Oh, Ma, how can I relax? Any minute now somebody can walk in here and tell me you're not really my mother.
LEADMALE:Let me remind you of something that may set your mind at ease.
LEADFEMALE:Are you going to tell a story? No, I'm gonna sing a Negro spiritual.
SUPFEMALE:Shut up and listen.
SUPMALE:Do you remember the first day you went to school? No.
OTHERFEMALE:I do.
OTHERFEMALE:You looked so adorable in that pink and white polka-dot dress.
LEADMALE:I loved that dress.
LEADFEMALE:Even after you outgrew it, it was tucked away in an upstairs closet for years.
SUPFEMALE:You put it away for sentimental reasons? No, your brother Phil hid it there.
OTHERMALE:He used to like to wear it when he visited the firehouse.
LEADMALE:Anyway, we got to the school and I walked you to your classroom, and as I turned to go you started to cry, "Mommy! Mommy! I want Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:" But the teacher told me to go, so I did, and I left you there screaming, crying, with the tears pouring down your face.
SUPMALE:I guess all kids go through that the first day of school.
SUPFEMALE:No, you were the only one.
SUPMALE:It took a good half-hour to calm you down, but that didn't last long.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? Every time the teacher turned her back, little Debbie did something she shouldn't.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course, her mother was the same way every time her father turned his back.
SUPMALE:The woman was a real tramp.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:But, uh, you digress.
SUPFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:So, there's Debbie putting gum in your hair, hiding your lunch, stealing your toys when no one was looking.
LEADFEMALE:When I come to pick you up, I figure you'll say you never wanna go to school again.
LEADMALE:But what do you tell me? You love it.
LEADFEMALE:You made a new friend named Debbie.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, what the hell does this have to do? Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:How did you know what happened? If the teacher didn't see Debbie-- I saw.
OTHERFEMALE:I stood at the window and watched you for four hours, in case you needed me.
LEADMALE:You didn't? No big deal.
LEADMALE:Any real mother would do that for her kid.
OTHERMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Petrillo? I have the result of your test.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's roll.
SUPFEMALE:I'm really looking forward to dance class today.
SUPMALE:I can see that.
SUPFEMALE:You're wearing your heat-seeking stretch pants.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, you're not dressed for class.
SUPMALE:That's because I'm not going.
LEADMALE:Why not? Why not? I will tell you why not.
LEADFEMALE:Because I cannot flounce around a dance floor like some cheap trashy slut in heat.
SUPMALE:Lord knows, I've tried.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, look-- Rose, please.
LEADMALE:I do not need a lecture.
LEADFEMALE:I am a klutz.
LEADMALE:I can accept that.
LEADMALE:I guess it's no big thing.
LEADFEMALE:You're just awkward when it comes to your body.
OTHERFEMALE:Say what? You have no coordination.
SUPMALE:Obviously the stories about all your romantic escapades have been greatly exaggerated.
LEADMALE:Just what is that supposed to mean? Blanche, if you can't do a simple dance, how do you expect me to believe that story about you and the Flying Fanelli Brothers? That was all true.
SUPMALE:To this day I get flushed every time I pass a junglegym.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, Blanche.
LEADMALE:That story is no truer than the one you told about you and Buzz in the lunar module.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that does it.
OTHERMALE:Rose, I would never lie about the US Space Program.
SUPMALE:Awkward when it comes to my body, huh? No coordination? You wanna see a body defy the laws of nature, physics and Dade County? You just hit that music, girl, and follow my lead.
LEADMALE:Look into my eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, girls.
OTHERFEMALE:This is not what it looks like.
SUPFEMALE:What they do is their business, but if I ever see your hand on Rose's behind it'll kill me.
LEADFEMALE:Ciao, everybody.
SUPMALE:We gotta catch a boat.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma, they're leaving.
LEADMALE:We're taking our daughter Gina back home to marry Guido.
LEADFEMALE:Your daughter Gina? Well, what about Dorothy? Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:What'd they say about the blood test? We didn't wait around for the results.
SUPFEMALE:I don't need a blood test to tell me who my mother is.
LEADMALE:A mother is someone who raises you and loves you and is always there for you.
LEADFEMALE:I don't need any more proof than that.
LEADMALE:Me neither.
SUPFEMALE:I raised her, and I was the one who got her through that awkward period.
LEADFEMALE:The 50 toughest years of my life.
LEADFEMALE:That's the same way we feel about our Gina.
LEADFEMALE:It's not that it wouldn't be nice to have you as a daughter, Dorotea, but we love Gina.
OTHERFEMALE:And so does Guido.
LEADMALE:He wrote us he could never love anyone but Gina.
LEADFEMALE:He wants us to return her to him right now.
SUPMALE:Dorotea, I am so sorry we put you through all this.
OTHERFEMALE:You would have made a wonderful daughter.
OTHERFEMALE:But then, you already have
OTHERMALE:for your mother, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Arrivederci.
SUPFEMALE:Ciao.
OTHERFEMALE:Ciao.
LEADFEMALE:Ciao.
LEADMALE:Oh, what sweet people.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I hope everything works OK for Gina.
LEADMALE:Why shouldn't it? She's got a man waiting for her back home who owns a goat.
LEADFEMALE:In Sicily that makes you a yuppie.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Rose, all that dancing has just done wonders for me.
SUPFEMALE:I feel so energized.
SUPFEMALE:I feel so alive.
LEADMALE:I feel like working this body up into a manic frenzy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, great.
LEADMALE:We still have time to get to class.
SUPMALE:Who cares about class? The circus is in town.
SUPFEMALE:I say we go look up the Flying Fanelli Brothers.
LEADMALE:How about a cup of tea, Ma? Hm? Good idea, pussycat.
SUPMALE:Ma, you never thought I wasn't your daughter, did you? Of course not.
LEADFEMALE:Because if you wanna check the results
SUPMALE:Oh, don't talk crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Go on and make the tea.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right in.
LEADMALE:What have you got there? Nothing.
LEADMALE:Ma, when you said you forgot your keys and you went back into the waiting room, you got the results of the test, didn't you? What if I did? Let me see the lab results, Ma.
SUPMALE:Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Petrillo to you.
SUPMALE:Then I'm not your daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Got you, Dorothy! It was just a shopping list.
LEADMALE:You have absolutely no sense of humor.
OTHERFEMALE:Just like your uncle Vito.
LEADFEMALE:At least, I think he was your uncle Vito.
OTHERFEMALE:Kidding.
LEADMALE:Just kidding.
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:This was a lovely afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'll say.
SUPFEMALE:I just love the legitimate theater.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I missed Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Lee J.
LEADFEMALE:Cobb in Death of a Salesman.
LEADFEMALE:I missed Mr.
SUPMALE:Marlon Brando in Streetcar Named Desire.
SUPMALE:Well, I was damned if I was gonna miss Mr.
LEADMALE:Dick Butkus in Pal Joey.
LEADFEMALE:And there's a brand-new water heater in the garage and wall-to-wall carpeting in all the bedrooms.
LEADMALE:Ma, what the hell are you doing? Selling the house.
LEADFEMALE:And that's a working fireplace, and with these cathedral ceilings, you could stack 50 VCRs if you wanted to.
LEADMALE:So, you think it over, and if you're interested, give us a call.
LEADMALE:I make offer now.
SUPFEMALE:If you like, you call me.
LEADMALE:Sophia, honey, you can't just sell my house.
LEADMALE:Is this in dollars? No, it's in cucumber rolls.
LEADMALE:Of course it's in dollars.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, what's this all about? You tell me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not the one who put the for-sale sign on our front lawn.
LEADFEMALE:What? Oh, damn! Those Donaldson boys must have moved that sign from the MacKenzies' front lawn and stuck it on ours.
LEADFEMALE:Then this is all a mistake.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but this sure isn't.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, what do you mean? Would you seriously consider selling the house? Well, no.
LEADMALE:I mean, I don't think so.
LEADMALE:You have to admit this is an awful lot of money.
LEADFEMALE:Frankly, more than I think the house is worth.
LEADFEMALE:And as your agent, three percent of it is mine.
SUPMALE:What do you say, Blanchey? Do we close the deal? Oh, I just don't know.
SUPMALE:This is all so sudden.
SUPMALE:There's so many things to consider.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look, Blanche, if you're worried about us, don't be.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, just because you're selling the house doesn't mean that we can't all find another place together.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I wasn't worried about you.
OTHERFEMALE:I was worried about the tax consequences of all this extra income.
LEADMALE:I'm kidding.
LEADMALE:Oh, I love you.
LEADFEMALE:You're my family.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, we're sticking together no matter what happens.
OTHERMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:It might be hard to find a place as perfect as this was for the four of us.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, hell, if we did it once, we can do it again.
LEADFEMALE:All we need is a little luck.
SUPMALE:It was luck that brought us together the first time.
SUPMALE:I will never forget when I first put up that notice at the supermarket.
LEADMALE:Remember? Are you OK? Oh, I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know exactly what you're going through.
LEADFEMALE:I can read it in your face.
SUPFEMALE:You can? Oh, sure.
LEADMALE:Your husband or your boyfriend dumped you.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, don't let it get you down.
LEADFEMALE:It's just the nature of the beast.
LEADMALE:They'd do it in the mud if they had to.
SUPFEMALE:You just go sleep with his best friend.
LEADMALE:That'll even up the score.
LEADFEMALE:Am I on Candid Camera? You mean, you didn't get dumped? Well, actually, I did.
LEADFEMALE:By my landlord.
LEADMALE:He threw me out of my apartment, but I couldn't sleep with his best friend.
SUPMALE:He's over 80 years old and thinks he's the Archduke Ferdinand.
LEADFEMALE:Why did he throw you out? Well, the new owners of the building don't allow cats and I'm not about to part with Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Peepers.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I guess you two have been through a lot together, huh? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:I found him last week.
LEADMALE:But I wouldn't feel right having a home if he didn't.
LEADMALE:We've become very attached.
OTHERMALE:You know what I think? That shows great strength of character.
LEADFEMALE:I like you and I like cats.
SUPFEMALE:I also happen to have a room for rent, and the name is Blanche Devereaux.
LEADFEMALE:Why would you name a room Blanche Devereaux? Oh, it's been such a lovely day.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Sunshine really gave us one of his biggest and brightest smiles.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I feel like putting my arms around Mother Nature and giving her a big kiss.
OTHERMALE:Hi, you must be Dorothy.
SUPMALE:And you must be Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Rogers.
LEADMALE:I didn't catch your name.
SUPMALE:I'm Rose Nylund, your new roomie.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche has told me all about you.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry your husband dumped you.
SUPMALE:You can borrow my bubble bath any time you want.
SUPMALE:That'll help ease the lonely nights.
LEADMALE:Thank you very much.
SUPMALE:I see you two are getting acquainted.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I'm just gonna take my stuff to my room.
LEADMALE:It's the second on the left down the hall there? Dorothy, the second on the left is mine.
SUPMALE:Blanche had promised it to me.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche promised it to me too.
LEADMALE:Didn't you? Whoops.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:What are we supposed to do now? Back in Minnesota, we'd settle this kind of a dispute with some good-natured logrolling.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry, Rose.
LEADMALE:My log is in the shop.
LEADMALE:What do we do now? Toss a coin? OK.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:I'll take tails.
SUPFEMALE:OK.
SUPFEMALE:Tails.
OTHERFEMALE:You win.
SUPFEMALE:I'll make it up to you, Dorothy, I promise.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, if there's ever a night where you can't sleep, I'll come to your room and sing "Kum Ba Ya.
LEADFEMALE:" Rose, I don't know what to say.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, I do.
LEADFEMALE:Don't ever do that.
SUPMALE:It just doesn't seem possible that five years has gone by since we moved in together.
LEADFEMALE:It's gonna be rough if we have to go our separate ways.
OTHERMALE:We've all learned to depend on each other so much.
LEADMALE:Especially Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:What's that supposed to mean? Oh, honey, it just means that sometimes you tend to be a bit naive, simple, childlike.
LEADMALE:She's calling you a moron.
LEADMALE:You don't want to live with a woman like that.
SUPMALE:Tell her to sell the house.
SUPMALE:Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Well, it just so happens that there are a lot of things I can do better than you guys.
LEADMALE:Name one.
LEADMALE:Can you tighten a horn on a helmet? Smoke a herring in a pine log? Check a bull for a hernia? I guess the really rough part is getting him to turn his head and cough.
LEADMALE:Come on, Rose.
LEADMALE:Pick a category we can compete in.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:What about that dance marathon? Whose butt got whopped that night? How did you know that Wally Oh, you mean at the actual dance marathon? That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Seems to me I showed you two guys a thing or two that night.
LEADMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, our charity dance marathon is now entering its seventh hour.
SUPMALE:Let's give our contestants a great big hand.
OTHERMALE:Hi, girls.
SUPMALE:How are you holding up? Oh, fine.
LEADFEMALE:Just doing fine.
LEADFEMALE:Terrific.
LEADFEMALE:You know, this reminds me of the big dance back in St.
SUPMALE:Olaf to kick off Pretzel Week.
LEADMALE:My Uncle Gunther, after the great Beer Nut shortage of '29 Foul! Foul! Send the judge over here.
LEADMALE:This woman is trying to put us to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:You're just exhausted and you're trying to blame it on me.
OTHERMALE:Exhausted? I'll show you who's exhausted.
LEADFEMALE:Maestro, how about something with a little octane? OK, little lady.
SUPMALE:All right, boys, take it away.
LEADFEMALE:A one, two, a one, two, three, four.
OTHERFEMALE:Out of my way, amateurs.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, do you mind if I give it a try?  Oh, for heaven's sake, go on.
LEADMALE:No, Dave, I better do this by myself.
SUPMALE:You might get hurt.
SUPMALE:Three, four.
LEADMALE:Girls, I'm really worried.
LEADFEMALE:Usually, by the time I've finished a cheesecake, I can solve any problem I'm trying to beat, This time I'm coming up empty.
SUPFEMALE:Then why is the top button on your skirt open? I'm talking about selling the house.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't know if it's the right thing to do.
SUPMALE:Well, honey, you don't have to decide tonight.
SUPMALE:You should take all the time you need.
LEADFEMALE:The point is, if you turn a nice buck on this place today, you can buy a bigger and better place tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:But I'm not sure I want to go right out and buy a new house.
OTHERMALE:Maybe I want to take some time to travel first.
LEADFEMALE:I have relatives scattered all over this country I don't get to see very much.
SUPFEMALE:If it's relatives you want, you should stay right here in Miami.
LEADFEMALE:Howard Johnson's does less business than this house has over the years.
LEADFEMALE:That is true.
LEADFEMALE:We've all had our share of family showing up.
OTHERFEMALE:I think things are going very nicely.
OTHERMALE:Save it, Ma.
SUPMALE:I am going to tell Uncle Angelo the truth.
SUPFEMALE:It's only for a couple of hours more.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, I can't do it.
LEADMALE:I mean, pretending we're married, acting as though nothing happened, it's making me crazy.
LEADFEMALE:It's time to take my heart medicine.
SUPMALE:You need a glass of water to take your pill? Not pills.
LEADMALE:I'll take a shot of Scotch, Uncle Angelo, I have a confession to make.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:I get my Scotch, we go in the closet.
SUPMALE:No, it's about Stan and me.
LEADFEMALE:You know something, Dorothy? On your wedding day, Sophia told me she said your marriage was never gonna last.
OTHERFEMALE:That made me very sad.
LEADFEMALE:And now to see you and Stan so happy after all of these years, it does an old man's heart good.
LEADMALE:And so does that.
LEADMALE:Uncle Angelo I'm so glad I disobeyed the doctor's orders and risked this long trip to see the both of you so much in love.
LEADFEMALE:Now, what were you saying? Uncle Angelo, I wanted to say Well, don't just stand there, Papa Bear.
OTHERFEMALE:Come give Mama Bear a big bear hug.
SUPFEMALE:Can I get you another slice of cake, Uncle Angelo? No, thank you.
OTHERMALE:I'll take a slice darling.
LEADFEMALE:No problem, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Hurry back, dumpling.
SUPMALE:My feet have wings, barf bag.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, please hang in there a little while longer, and Angelo will be on a plane headed for Brooklyn.
LEADFEMALE:Wish I'd taken my raincoat.
SUPFEMALE:Why are you two dressed like that? Well, these are our costumes for the play, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:We were in the middle of dress rehearsal when they told us all to go home right away.
SUPFEMALE:There's a hurricane heading for Miami.
OTHERMALE:You know, I think I will take a slice of cake Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Uncle Angelo, I'd like you to meet um uh I'm Sister Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Piacere.
OTHERMALE:Nice to meet you.
LEADMALE:I'm Sister Blanche.
LEADMALE:Nice to meet you, Sister Blanche.
LEADMALE:We're here, uh, collecting lingerie for needy sexy people.
LEADMALE:I just heard on TV the airports are closed.
SUPMALE:There's a big hurricane headed this way.
LEADMALE:They want everyone to stay just where they are.
LEADFEMALE:That means that we could be trapped together for days! Oh, Jesus! Please protect us and watch over us in this, our hour of need.
OTHERFEMALE:Amen.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, Lucy.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Get in here.
LEADMALE:I want you to meet my friends.
LEADMALE:This is Sophia and Dorothy and Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Nice to meet you, Lucy.
SUPMALE:Let me get a look at you, girl.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm, terrific little figure, gorgeous hair, perfect skin.
LEADFEMALE:Just like looking in a mirror.
OTHERFEMALE:Get some Windex.
LEADMALE:How was your trip? Oh, it was wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:I met a gorgeous, single doctor on the plane.
LEADFEMALE:At 30,000 feet, she picks up a doctor.
LEADFEMALE:Now I see the family resemblance.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, I'm supposed to meet him in a half-hour, if that's OK.
LEADMALE:But, darling, you just got here.
LEADMALE:Aunt Blanche, you always 
LEADFEMALE:"If you've a stallion eating oats outta your hand, best close the gate before you give him the sugar.
LEADFEMALE:" You said that, Blanche? I won't go if you don't want me to, but I do want to go, so can I? Would your mother let you go? No.
SUPFEMALE:Then go.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:You're the best.
LEADMALE:I'll see y'all later.
SUPMALE:Oh, isn't she something? I'm really proud of her.
LEADMALE:Now, if I could just manage to rope myself a doctor that easily.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, I don't think there's enough sugar left in the bowl.
SUPMALE:Angela, that was the best meal I've ever had in my life.
LEADMALE:Well, how good could it have been? You left half of it.
LEADMALE:I ate every bite.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, there's some sauce left.
LEADFEMALE:If you really liked it, you'd take a hunk of that bread and sop it all up.
SUPMALE:You can afford it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, I can't.
SUPMALE:I've put on a few pounds.
SUPFEMALE:You just haven't noticed.
LEADFEMALE:What am I? Blind? I can see that.
OTHERMALE:I meant the bread.
LEADMALE:You can afford the bread.
SUPMALE:It's only 89 cents a loaf.
LEADMALE:Angela, why don't you sit down? I'll serve dessert.
SUPFEMALE:Gosh, you two made such a fantastic meal, I can't imagine what you came up with for dessert.
SUPFEMALE:I made dessert.
SUPFEMALE:Damn! What'd you say, Blanche? Yum.
OTHERMALE:I said yum.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, is this another one of those Scandinavian Viking concoctions? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:It's called genurkenflurken cake.
LEADMALE:It's an ancient recipe, but I Americanized it.
LEADMALE:So one might say you brought geflurkenurken into the '80s? Yes, but I'm not one to blow my own vertubenflugen.
SUPMALE:I can't even reach mine.
LEADFEMALE:So, Sophia, have you all had a chance to catch up on old times? Yeah, Angela filled me in on how all my friends and family back home are doing.
LEADFEMALE:How is everybody, Angela? Dead.
LEADMALE:Angela and I are the only two left of the original family.
SUPFEMALE:That's terrible, Angela.
LEADMALE:Does that mean you're all alone back in Sicily? Oh, no.
OTHERFEMALE:I have a goat.
SUPMALE:It's really a shame you and Ma don't live closer to each other.
SUPMALE:Dorothy is right.
SUPFEMALE:How many years do we have left? in the same town.
SUPMALE:You wanna come back to that little village in Sicily? Please, do I look like a woman who beats her laundry on a rock? I meant you should move here to Miami.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's a great idea.
SUPFEMALE:Angela, you would love Miami.
SUPFEMALE:Aunt Angela, what do you say? Oh, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I'm too old to pick up and move to a strange country.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? Before your husband died, you lived here for 30 years.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Now, just think about it.
SUPFEMALE:Who would you rather live with? Your sister or a goat? Give me a minute.
SUPMALE:Cousin Rose? Cousin Sven! Oh! Oh, let me look at you! Boy, have you grown! We've never met.
OTHERFEMALE:But admit it, you have grown.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Rose, could you introduce Blanche and me? Of course.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, this is Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, this is Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:We have jokes like that around here all the time.
OTHERMALE:It's like living in a house full of Howie Mandels.
OTHERFEMALE:Sven, I'm Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:And I'm Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Rose tells us you're getting married.
OTHERMALE:Yes, and I hope I'm good at it.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have that much experience with women.
LEADMALE:A big, strong, handsome thing like you? Get out of here.
LEADMALE:Well, it was nice meeting all of you.
LEADMALE:No! That was an expression, Sven.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I never thought I'd say this, but I think Rose got the brains in that family.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, let's make a pact.
SUPFEMALE:If we decide to keep this house, we're gonna limit the number of relatives that get to come to visit.
LEADMALE:I wonder who that could be.
OTHERMALE:I'm sure it's no one.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, it's me, Stan.
LEADMALE:See? What did I tell you? Stanley, what do you want? I need to borrow a car.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Doesn't anybody want to know why I need to borrow a car?  No.
SUPMALE:Fine, fine.
SUPFEMALE:I know when I'm not wanted.
SUPMALE:Is anybody eating that? All right, Stanley.
SUPMALE:Why do you want to borrow the car? Ah! I am involved in a new business venture.
LEADMALE:Stan's Pizzas.
LEADFEMALE:The gimmick is I can deliver a pizza faster to your house than Domino's.
OTHERFEMALE:There's only one problem.
LEADFEMALE:What? It's impossible.
LEADFEMALE:I cracked up my car trying.
SUPFEMALE:So the reason you want to use our car is so you can deliver pizzas? No.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, what I would really like for you girls to do is be my drivers.
SUPFEMALE:I belong in the front office
OTHERFEMALE:supervising, franchising, teasing the high-school girls that work for me.
SUPMALE:I sense I may have just lost you.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, what the hell.
SUPFEMALE:I'm out of the pizza business.
LEADMALE:Is there anything else to eat? Stanley, why do you always end up here when you have a problem? You're my best friends.
LEADMALE:But we don't like you.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but you're still my best friends.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you can't depend on coming around here forever.
LEADMALE:Blanche is thinking about selling the house.
LEADFEMALE:Selling our house? You can't be serious.
OTHERFEMALE:We've had great times here.
LEADFEMALE:We have had great times here.
OTHERFEMALE:You've just had free food.
LEADFEMALE:That is not true.
LEADFEMALE:We've had a million laughs under this roof.
LEADMALE:Do you Do you remember the time I came over? Dorothy, I know it's been a while, but try to control yourself.
SUPFEMALE:I need some rest.
LEADMALE:What the hell is that for? You're not getting into this bed, Stanley.
SUPFEMALE:Then where am I supposed to sleep? On the floor, like any dog.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Just fine.
OTHERMALE:Stan Zbornak doesn't have to beg a woman to get into bed.
SUPFEMALE:Women come to me.
SUPMALE:Yeah, right after they get the approval number on your MasterCard.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
SUPMALE:Oh, shut up.
LEADMALE:Stanley, if you're doing what I think you're doing, you're in big trouble.
LEADMALE:I was just remembering the first time you ever kicked me out of bed and I had to sleep on the floor.
SUPMALE:Emile Zundt's Hidden Honeymoon Hideaway in the Poconos.
OTHERFEMALE:"Where every cottage is April in Paris.
SUPFEMALE:" And every bathroom, Calcutta in July.
LEADMALE:Do you remember how I convinced you to let me back into bed? No.
LEADMALE:I've got a crush on you Sweetie pie All the day and nighttime Hear me sigh Oh, Stanley Zbornak, I don't believe that you're trying to charm me.
LEADMALE:Is it working? I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:Then you leave me no choice.
LEADFEMALE:I'll have to pull out the big gun.
SUPMALE:You're wasting your time, Stanley.
SUPMALE:I'm familiar with the big gun.
LEADMALE:Here goes.
LEADFEMALE:Embrace me My sweet, embraceable you Embrace me You irreplaceable you Dorothy! Dorothy, I just had a terrible nightmare.
LEADMALE:Ma, what was it? This.
OTHERFEMALE:Break it up.
LEADMALE:Stanley, think of me as the Berlin Wall.
SUPMALE:Try to climb over me, and you'll know what barbed wire between your legs feels like.
OTHERMALE:Gotcha.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, how did this start? Cole Porter? Gershwin.
SUPMALE:Thank God I came in time.
LEADFEMALE:We've certainly had some good times, haven't we, girls? Yes, we have, and we'd like to have more, so would you please leave, Stanley? Girls, I've made a decision.
LEADFEMALE:What is it, Blanche?  There are just too many precious memories in this house.
LEADMALE:I'm not about to trade them in for a few lousy dollars.
LEADMALE:It's Yakamora.
LEADFEMALE:He's doubled his offer.
LEADFEMALE:Tell him we'll be out by the first of the month.
LEADMALE:Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see The biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Couldn't sleep either, Dorothy? No, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Are you upset because Blanche is gonna sell the house and we can't live together? No, I'm upset because Joe Piscopo didn't get the lead role in Rain Man.
LEADMALE:Oh, of course I'm upset about the house.
LEADMALE:Ma, it's 2am.
LEADMALE:Where have you been? I stuffed pillows under the sheets so I could fool you during bed check.
SUPMALE:What is this, Stalag 17? I went for a walk.
LEADMALE:I couldn't sleep.
LEADMALE:I had a nightmare.
LEADMALE:Tell me about it, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Sometimes I can interpret dreams.
OTHERMALE:Blanche sold the house and I wound up back at Shady Pines.
LEADMALE:Hmm.
SUPMALE:This is a tough one.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, please don't send me back.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, I am not sending you back to Shady Pines.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God! She found a cheaper home.
LEADMALE:Blanche, please, please don't sell the house.
LEADMALE:What the hell is that holding up your stockings? Get out of there.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, listen.
OTHERMALE:I know I told Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Yakamora that I'd sell him the house, but I just don't think it's fair to make that decision by myself now.
LEADFEMALE:Give me some advice.
LEADMALE:Just tell me what to do.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's your house, Blanche.
LEADMALE:You have to make your own decision.
LEADMALE:Since when have you all been so shy? We always tell each other what to do.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, are you all right? I'll be fine.
LEADFEMALE:Is this about Arnie? No, Blanche.
LEADMALE:She's upset because they keep changing the taste of Coke.
SUPMALE:Arnie wants me to go away with him on a cruise to the Bahamas.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, and you're upset because he wants you to pay your own way? I'm upset because we'll be all alone.
LEADMALE:In the middle of the ocean.
SUPFEMALE:On a ship.
LEADMALE:In a stateroom.
LEADFEMALE:With a bed.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I don't know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't been with a man in that special way since Charlie died.
LEADMALE:Get out of here! It's true.
SUPMALE:Charlie was the only lover I ever had.
SUPFEMALE:And my first time was on our wedding night.
SUPMALE:Get out of here! Oh, back off, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Not all of us are classified by the Navy as a friendly port.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe it sounds strange but, without Charlie, I thought that part of my life was over.
LEADFEMALE:I never gave it a second thought.
OTHERMALE:Until now? Then I think you should go on the cruise.
LEADMALE:Honey, if the situation is right, you'll know it.
LEADFEMALE:But I'm not sure I'm ready.
SUPMALE:Oh, honey, I know what you're going through.
LEADMALE:The bottom line is, if you take a chance in life, sometimes good things happen, sometimes bad things happen.
LEADMALE:But, honey, if you don't take a chance, nothing happens.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna take a chance.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's wonderful! Oh, great, Rose! Oh, I have to look in my closet.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even know what to wear for the first night on the ship.
LEADFEMALE:A life jacket and a great big smile.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, I wonder what Rose is doing right now.
LEADFEMALE:You mean, you wonder if she's doing it right now.
LEADMALE:No, I just wonder if maybe we didn't push her into something too fast.
LEADFEMALE:What I can't understand is how in the world she managed to wait 15 years.
SUPMALE:How long did you wait after George died? Till the paramedics came.
LEADMALE:Ma! What about you, Dorothy? Who was the first after Stan, hm? Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Her divorce lawyer.
LEADMALE:How did you know? It's always the divorce lawyer.
SUPMALE:Oh, it was a terrible time for me.
SUPMALE:You know, I'd gone on an eating binge when Stan left and I put on quite a bit of weight.
OTHERFEMALE:Plus, I was not a 20-year-old.
SUPFEMALE:You know, when you're 20, no matter what you do, everything stays where it's supposed to.
SUPMALE:Now when you lean over, it looks like somebody's let the air out of your face.
LEADMALE:What? Honey, lean over a mirror some time and take a look at yourself.
LEADMALE:Where's a mirror? There's one in the tool drawer.
SUPFEMALE:I think you'd better take a sedative before you look.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be silly.
LEADFEMALE:I look at my face all the time.
LEADFEMALE:How different could it be leaning over? Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Dorothy, why didn't you tell me about this before? Only on your back, Blanche.
LEADMALE:That way everything slides back and you look like you just had a face lift.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gorgeous.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna have to meet men lying down.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you did.
SUPFEMALE:Of course, that way, not only does your face fall back but your chest does too.
SUPMALE:Unfortunately, it falls back and off to the side.
LEADMALE:Well, it's too late to do anything until morning.
OTHERFEMALE:We might as well get some sleep.
LEADMALE:I can't sleep.
LEADFEMALE:I'm wound up tighter than the girdle on a Baptist minister's wife at an all-you-can-eat pancake breakfast.
LEADMALE:Wow, that's tight.
SUPFEMALE:Back in St.
OTHERFEMALE:Olaf, when I couldn't sleep, I'd get into my pajamas and have a nice glass of warm milk and slip under the covers and count cows jumping over my bed.
SUPFEMALE:It'd usually work like a charm, except every once in a while there'd be a cow with a particularly low udder and it would brush across my forehead and wake me up.
SUPMALE:I just don't know what I'm gonna do.
LEADMALE:I'm just torn and confused.
LEADMALE:Guess I'll have to think about it all tomorrow.
LEADMALE:After all, tomorrow is another day.
LEADFEMALE:Calm down, Scarlett.
LEADMALE:There's no need to be so dramatic.
LEADMALE:Please.
LEADMALE:She can't help it.
SUPFEMALE:Everyone around here acts like a ham.
SUPFEMALE:There's been more bad acting, bad dancing and bad singing under this roof than a Suzanne Somers Special.
SUPFEMALE:Rose! Blanche! Dorothy! Go, Dorothy, go! Gosh, I didn't realize how long Dorothy's solo is.
SUPFEMALE:I sure hope the doctor says she's gonna be all right.
LEADMALE:I won't dance.
LEADFEMALE:Don't ask me.
LEADMALE:Pay attention.
LEADFEMALE:You're in for a treat.
SUPMALE:Oh, Ma, not another act! No, Dorothy, not just another act
SUPMALE:the act.
LEADFEMALE:I've taken a classic and reworked it Sophia style.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks for the medicare For Blue Cross and Blue Shield For a hip that finally healed Remember on prescriptions Generic is a steal We thank you so much OK, what do you think? Now, don't hold back.
LEADMALE:I can take the criticism.
SUPMALE:Depressing.
OTHERFEMALE:Awful.
LEADMALE:Stinky.
SUPFEMALE:Go to hell, all of you! I will not have that filthy beast in my house.
SUPMALE:It belongs in a barnyard.
LEADFEMALE:This is not a farm chicken.
OTHERFEMALE:Count Bessie is a show-biz chicken.
LEADFEMALE:Wait till you see this.
SUPMALE:A show-biz chicken.
LEADFEMALE:What does she do? Play the piano? She plays the piano.
LEADMALE:You just wait till you see this.
SUPMALE:OK, honey, come on.
SUPMALE:It's showtime.
SUPMALE:Yeah, come on, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Oh, I know.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:OK, Count, hit it!  Isn't she incredible? What do you say, girls? Can she stay? I guess so.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:Just be sure to keep her in her cage.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Maybe I can convince the count to give us some live entertainment with dessert.
OTHERFEMALE:Have you any requests? How about "Bye Bye Birdie"? Girls! Girls, Count Bessie is missing.
SUPFEMALE:I went out to the garage to feed her and her cage was empty.
LEADFEMALE:Where could she be? Aunt Angela Where did you get this chicken?  The garage.
LEADMALE:I guess this means no live entertainment with dessert.
SUPMALE:Oh, hello, there.
LEADMALE:How'd you do? We came in second.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's terrific.
LEADMALE:What'd you get? Treated badly.
LEADMALE:They told us to get out of the way when they took the winner's picture with Anita Bryant.
SUPMALE:Oh, what do those old judges know? I'd love to hear your song.
SUPMALE:Oh, forget it, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:The whole experience was too painful.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
LEADMALE:We want to put it out of our minds.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
OTHERFEMALE:Hit it, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I have to say what I feel Miami has so much appeal A great place to get a seafood meal Miami Miami, Miami You've got style Blue skies, sunshine, white sand by the mile When you live in this town Each day is sublime The coldest of winters Are warm and divine Miami, Miami You've got style Blue skies, sunshine, white sand by the mile Hit it!

The cream of the crop, it's the top of the line Miami, Miami You've got style Blue skies, sunshine, white sand by the mile Miami You've got style Look, you're all confused and upset about this house business.
LEADMALE:There's only one thing you can do.
LEADMALE:What is that, Sophia? Take the advice of a wise old Sicilian.
LEADMALE:You, Sophia? No.
LEADMALE:Charlie Callas.
SUPFEMALE:Many years ago, my father had a similar problem when he was selling real estate.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't know that Grandpa ever owned any real estate.
LEADFEMALE:He didn't.
SUPFEMALE:That was the problem.
LEADMALE:You see, it turned out he really didn't own the Vatican.
OTHERFEMALE:Although he did have a very close friend who swore he was there the night Pop won the deed in a card game from Pope Ronnie the Magnificent.
OTHERFEMALE:Sophia, you're not making any sense.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Kierkegaard, it's 4am.
SUPMALE:Ma, is there a point to this? And if there wasn't, what are you gonna do? Put decorative bars on my window? Yes, there is a point.
LEADFEMALE:If you're gonna sell real estate, make sure you own it.
SUPMALE:Sophia, I do own this house.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Is anybody else hungry? Now that you mention it, I could really go for a pizza.
SUPMALE:I've been thinking about Chinese.
SUPFEMALE:I could go for a burger and fries.
LEADMALE:Why don't we order it all? Oh, Sophia, that'd be crazy.
SUPFEMALE:So, this would be the first time we did something a little out of the ordinary around here? Ma, thank God you're here.
LEADMALE:Arrested for prostitution.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, we're innocent.
SUPFEMALE:I know that.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe these dumb cops would think anyone would pay money to sleep with you.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, did you come to bail us out? No, Rose, she's dropping off a manicotti with a file in it.
SUPMALE:Well, girls, we're gonna get to see Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Burt Reynolds after all.
SUPMALE:I thought these beautiful tickets were all gonna go to waste.
LEADFEMALE:So which one of you isn't going? Well, I'm the one who won the tickets.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, my mom's the one who's bailing us out.
LEADMALE:I lost Butter Queen.
LEADMALE:Haven't I suffered enough? We'll draw straws.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:We'll flip a coin.
SUPMALE:No! Sophia, we had this all settled.
LEADMALE:Now, try and be understanding.
OTHERFEMALE:Understanding? I came down here to bail you out and you're still not letting me go? Ma, will you stop complaining and get us out of here? Where are your roommates, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Petrillo? They're not here.
LEADMALE:Ma! Don't "Ma" me, you cheap floozie.
LEADMALE:Ma, Ma, you would do this to your own flesh and blood? You'll get over it, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:And if you don't, who cares? I'm on my way to see Burt Reynolds.
LEADMALE:And then
LEADMALE:you're gonna love this
LEADMALE:Dom DeLuise takes me by the arm and insists I tell Burt the story.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, I don't want to hear any more about it.
SUPMALE:Not even the part when Burt and Dom insisted I repeat the story to Loni Anderson? That's it.
LEADMALE:I don't want to hear another word.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Cinderella's back from the ball and her three wicked roommates are jealous.
SUPMALE:We are not jealous, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:We are angry.
OTHERFEMALE:You left us sitting in jail.
LEADMALE:Hey, I sent over the bail money.
LEADMALE:You were out an hour later.
SUPMALE:I think that was just about the time I was nibbling a giant shrimp out of Jerry Reed's hand.
LEADFEMALE:You're making this whole thing up just to rub it in.
LEADMALE:You have never met these people.
SUPMALE:Jealousy is a very ugly thing, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:And so are you in anything backless.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Is Sophia around? Oh, hi, Burt.
LEADFEMALE:How about a little lunch? Listen, if you're buying, how about a big lunch? Great.
LEADFEMALE:My God, you're Mr.
LEADMALE:Burt Reynolds.
SUPMALE:I hope so, otherwise I got the wrong underwear on.
LEADMALE:These the roommates you told me about? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Which one's the slut?  I am.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, it is not here! Look again.
LEADMALE:It has to be.
LEADMALE:Rose, I have read every want ad in the paper.
LEADFEMALE:Mine is not here.
SUPMALE:Are you sure you dropped it off at the newspaper office? Dorothy, you told me exactly what you wanted me to do a dozen times.
LEADFEMALE:Any idiot could have done it.
SUPMALE:I know, honey, but you were the only one going downtown.
SUPFEMALE:Are you sure that you dropped it off at the newspaper office? Yes! Six people already called while you were out.
LEADMALE:Give that to me.
LEADMALE:I'll try and find it for you.
LEADMALE:Dorothy? Have we met? Not yet.
LEADFEMALE:I'm here because of your ad in the 
LEADFEMALE:"Willing to do anything, $8 an hour, no job too big or small.
LEADMALE:" Yes, yes, of course.
LEADMALE:Please come in.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't expect people to actually come here.
LEADMALE:I just figured, you know, that I would be going to them.
SUPFEMALE:That's the way it'll work in the future, when my video camera gets back from the shop.
LEADFEMALE:So tell me, what type of work is it that you need done, Mr Toto.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Toto.
SUPMALE:Oh, no "Mr.
LEADMALE:" Just "Toto.
LEADMALE:" You're Dorothy, and I'm Toto.
LEADMALE:At least for the next $8.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, you owe me an apology.
LEADFEMALE:Your ad's right here.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose, this is the personals column.
LEADMALE:So what? So what? You put an ad in the personals column that said I will do anything for $8 an hour? Oh, look, it's right under an ad that 
SUPFEMALE:"History professor seeking nonsmoking Oriental woman who is into Wesson oil and bears a resemblance to Florence Henderson.
LEADMALE:" Is that signed "Doug"? Yes.
OTHERMALE:I know him.
SUPMALE:He's a sick man.
LEADMALE:I'm terribly sorry for this mix-up.
SUPFEMALE:Goodbye.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God, I don't believe this! I'm gonna call the cops if you don't get out of here right away, you pervert! Hi, Father Rossi.
LEADMALE:Here's the canned goods for the needy.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm I'm terribly sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I promise that I will say Hail Marys until Madonna has a hit movie.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Here's my $8.
LEADMALE:Let's get started, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I'm not Dorothy.
LEADMALE:She is.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll give you $4.
LEADMALE:Let's get started.
OTHERFEMALE:How would you like your rear end kicked across the street? Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:Here's the other $4.
LEADFEMALE:Girls.
LEADMALE:Girls, there is a busload of Greek sailors out front.
LEADMALE:They wanna know how many drachma there are in $8.
SUPMALE:Girls, guess what I found.
LEADMALE:Fernando! That's not Fernando.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean, that's not Fernando? How could you tell? All you have to do is look in his eyes.
SUPMALE:Or at the price tag stuck to his back.
SUPMALE:Oops! Thanks for trying, Blanche.
LEADMALE:It's nice to know I have a friend like you who cares.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, I have a confession to make.
SUPFEMALE:Rose didn't lose Fernando.
LEADMALE:I gave him to Daisy when she was helping out with the rummage sale.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, then there's no problem, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Just call Daisy and get Fernando back.
OTHERFEMALE:She's a very sweet kid.
LEADFEMALE:She'll understand.
LEADMALE:I tried that.
LEADMALE:She said no.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? She's not a sweet kid anymore.
LEADFEMALE:She's holding Fernando for ransom.
LEADFEMALE:Come on! Dorothy, she sent me one of his ears.
LEADMALE:You! Good morning.
SUPMALE:Well, kid, what do you want? I changed my mind.
OTHERMALE:I was wrong to ask for all those gifts.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, you see? I knew she'd come to her senses.
LEADFEMALE:I decided cash is better.
LEADMALE:That way I can buy exactly what I want.
SUPMALE:I'll get my purse.
SUPFEMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, I'm not gonna let you do that.
LEADFEMALE:I've been doing a lot of thinking.
LEADMALE:If, after all the years of love and companionship, Fernando and I are meant to part company, I'll just have to accept that.
SUPMALE:Time to time, life deals you an unfriendly hand.
LEADMALE:There's nothing you can do about it.
LEADFEMALE:I guess there's a lesson to be learned here.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes life just isn't fair, kiddo.
LEADFEMALE:I cannot talk about this anymore.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just gonna call Yakamora and give him my decision.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Make your call.
SUPMALE:We'll give you some privacy.
LEADFEMALE:We'll go in the other room.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:What do you think she's gonna do? I think she's gonna sell.
LEADMALE:It's just too much money.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche is too sentimental.
LEADMALE:I think she's gonna stay.
LEADMALE:What do you think, Ma? Ma! Quiet.
LEADMALE:Oh, this is just the operator.
LEADMALE:Your phone is working fine.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, what did you hear? You're never gonna believe what happened.
LEADMALE:You are never gonna believe what happened.
LEADMALE:Yakamora decided not to buy the house.
LEADMALE:What happened? Well, he went on a shopping spree and he spent all his money.
LEADFEMALE:He bought a department store in Fort Lauderdale and a condominium in Orlando, a baseball team in Tampa, and I think one of the Landers sisters.
LEADFEMALE:But what were you gonna tell him? What if he hadn't backed out? What difference does that make now? The important thing is we're staying together.
OTHERFEMALE:You were gonna sell, weren't you? Damn straight.
LEADFEMALE:But I was not gonna let it break us up.
SUPFEMALE:We are staying together.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care what happens.
LEADFEMALE:We are family.
LEADFEMALE:We are a team.
LEADMALE:Come on, everybody, group hug.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:Oh, girls, let me tell you this wonderful idea I had.
LEADFEMALE:When I was a little girl, my mama told me my destiny.
LEADFEMALE:She said, "Peacock"
LEADMALE:that was my nickname
SUPMALE:Peacock.
LEADMALE:"you are destined for great things.
SUPFEMALE:" Why "Peacock"? Because I was so beautiful.
LEADMALE:Anyway, she said I don't find peacocks so beautiful.
SUPMALE:They've got skinny necks.
SUPFEMALE:And they shriek.
LEADMALE:It doesn't matter, Rose.
LEADMALE:And they attack chickens.
SUPMALE:I don't care about chickens, Rose.
SUPMALE:She didn't call me "Chicken," she called me "Peacock.
LEADFEMALE:" You look more like a chicken.
LEADFEMALE:When you're angry, your neck sticks out like a chicken.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, it doesn't matter.
LEADMALE:I was beautiful.
LEADMALE:That was the point.
SUPFEMALE:I was breathtaking.
SUPMALE:Even more breathtaking than I am today.
SUPMALE:But my beauty was not everything, my mama said.
SUPMALE:My destiny was to be more than every man's passion.
LEADMALE:She said my destiny was to be great.
LEADFEMALE:She lied to you so you'd finish high school.
LEADMALE:Well, now I know what my destiny is, Rose.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna be a novelist.
OTHERFEMALE:A great romance novelist! That is my destiny.
LEADMALE:I shall become a great Southern writer, carrying on the tradition of the other great Southern writers like uh All those others so famous they need not be mentioned.
LEADMALE:Oh, girls, it's gonna be so exciting.
LEADFEMALE:I am gonna make a fortune.
LEADFEMALE:And I won't even have to use my imagination.
OTHERFEMALE:My life is a romance novel.
LEADMALE:Your life is a sports page.
LEADMALE:Listen.
SUPFEMALE:Tell me I can't do better than this in my sleep.
LEADFEMALE:"He grabbed her.
LEADFEMALE:"She could feel his fingers pressing into her moist flesh.
LEADFEMALE:"Her heart was pounding, her loins on fire.
OTHERMALE:As he spun her around, her dress ripping open" You know how many times I've experienced that? Your loins have been on fire? Yes.
LEADMALE:"She melted" Where exactly are your loins? Rose, it doesn't matter.
LEADFEMALE:Just listen.
SUPFEMALE:"She melted into his arms, faint now with the animal musk of him.
SUPFEMALE:" I didn't know people had loins.
LEADFEMALE:I've heard of loin of pork, but In her case, the same thing.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, you want to hear my idea? You won't believe it.
LEADMALE:Sorry, Blanche, I can't.
OTHERFEMALE:What's the matter, Dorothy? Oh, I don't know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I was in front of the class and I couldn't talk.
LEADMALE:I was too tired to talk.
SUPMALE:Not that they would have listened.
LEADFEMALE:They were too busy sniffing the whiteout they'd stolen from typing class.
LEADMALE:I had to excuse them early.
LEADMALE:I mean, I just cannot get rid of this flu.
LEADFEMALE:And it keeps getting worse, not better.
LEADMALE:But it's been months now.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it's not the flu.
LEADMALE:Flu doesn't last that long.
LEADFEMALE:You ought to go back to Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Raymond.
SUPMALE:I did, Blanche.
LEADMALE:He said I'm fine.
SUPMALE:Get a second opinion.
LEADMALE:She did.
LEADMALE:She went to Dr.
OTHERFEMALE:Schlesinger.
LEADMALE:Well, then, you are fine.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you want to hear my idea? She is not fine, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Look at her.
OTHERMALE:I didn't say she looks fine.
SUPFEMALE:I said she was fine.
LEADMALE:She looks like hell.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Oh, you know, I think in my novel, my heroine will be sick.
LEADMALE:Tragically sick, but snatched back from death by a doctor with the hands of a peasant and the soul of a poet.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my God, I'm writing already.
SUPFEMALE:Somebody take this down.
LEADMALE:What is she talking about? Forget her.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, you've got to see another doctor.
LEADFEMALE:Raymond is not a specialist.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but what kind of specialist do I need? Well, just call up Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Raymond and ask him.
LEADFEMALE:He'll refer you.
LEADFEMALE:You have to, honey.
SUPMALE:You're getting sicker and sicker.
LEADFEMALE:Just like my heroine.
LEADMALE:Sicker and sicker.
LEADMALE:Though, of course, my heroine doesn't look like you.
LEADFEMALE:This is a romantic novel, not science fiction.
LEADMALE:Remind me when I feel better to kick the crap out of her.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry to keep you waiting, Lorraine, but there was something I had to take care of.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm not Lorraine.
LEADFEMALE:You're not Lorraine Maslansky? No.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Because I have her chart here.
LEADFEMALE:Hand me my purse.
LEADFEMALE:I'll check my driver's license.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:Then you must be Oh, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Right, of course.
SUPMALE:OK, we have Dorothy here.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry to keep you waiting, Dorothy, but there was something I had to take care of.
LEADMALE:That's all right.
LEADMALE:A famous person
LEADFEMALE:very, very famous.
SUPFEMALE:But I can't tell you who it is.
SUPFEMALE:Ethics
SUPMALE:you know, we have to be quite careful about that.
LEADFEMALE:But if this was Win, Lose or Draw, I'd draw a crown.
LEADFEMALE:What? That was a hint.
LEADMALE:Oh, oh.
OTHERMALE:Do you have my test results? Sure do.
LEADFEMALE:And? A king.
LEADMALE:But that's it.
SUPFEMALE:No more clues.
SUPFEMALE:My lips are sealed.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Think about it.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't care who it is.
OTHERFEMALE:It could be the king of England.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't care.
SUPMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:England doesn't have a king.
LEADMALE:Try Saudi Arabia.
SUPMALE:Look, all I can think about are my test results and how to keep this gown closed.
SUPFEMALE:Well, don't worry about it.
LEADFEMALE:You won't be needing it.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, get dressed.
SUPFEMALE:You're fine.
LEADFEMALE:I beg your pardon? We've run every test known to man.
SUPMALE:They're all normal.
LEADMALE:You can get dressed, go home, enjoy your life.
LEADMALE:Dr.
SUPMALE:Stevens, I was always healthy, and then I came down with this flu.
LEADFEMALE:I can't get rid of it.
LEADFEMALE:I've been sick for five months now.
SUPFEMALE:I have a constant sore throat, swollen glands, fevers.
LEADMALE:My muscles ache and are weak.
LEADFEMALE:I am totally exhausted all the time.
LEADMALE:I know, I know.
SUPFEMALE:You told me.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, maybe it bears repeating.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you still think I'm Lorraine Maslansky.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Dorothy, can I ask you a personal question? Yes.
LEADMALE:You're divorced? Yes.
LEADMALE:How's your social life? Do you see men? What in the world does seeing men have to do with anything? Well, Dorothy, we know for a fact that if people are not happy
SUPFEMALE:and lonely people aren't
LEADFEMALE:they get all kinds of symptoms.
LEADFEMALE:Depression, fatigue Symptoms very much like the ones you describe.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Stevens, I don't think you understand, so I'm gonna tell you again.
SUPFEMALE:I am at a point now where I am so exhausted that sometimes I cannot speak, literally cannot speak.
OTHERMALE:There are days when I can't get out of bed.
LEADFEMALE:I Raising my arms to wash my hair in the shower is too exhausting for me.
SUPMALE:I can't even do that.
SUPMALE:I have heart palpitations.
LEADFEMALE:I can't concentrate.
LEADMALE:I forget things.
OTHERFEMALE:I I get confused.
SUPMALE:Look, Dorothy, I don't believe you're sick, but you do.
SUPMALE:You want to pursue this, you want to spend more money, that's fine with me.
OTHERFEMALE:So, go to New York and see the man I studied with.
LEADMALE:He's the best neurologist there is.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know anyone better.
SUPMALE:If you have anything, anything at all, he'll find it.
LEADMALE:Two and a half hours! I thought you'd died.
OTHERMALE:What's wrong with you? Nothing.
LEADMALE:Who are you? I'm the doctor.
LEADMALE:We'll see about that.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Mrs Petrillo.
SUPMALE:I'm Dorothy's mother, and I want to know what's wrong with her.
LEADMALE:And don't tell me nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I know there's something wrong with her.
OTHERMALE:Mothers know.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Ma, I'll talk to you about it later.
LEADMALE:Your daughter is fine, Mrs Petrillo.
LEADMALE:Tiptop? Tiptop.
SUPFEMALE:Then, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:100% Tiptop, why the hell does she feel like hell? Look, Ma Wait, I gotta hear this.
LEADFEMALE:It could be functional.
LEADMALE:Functional? Mental.
SUPFEMALE:Mental! Well, let me tell you something, Mr.
LEADMALE:100% Tiptop Mental.
LEADFEMALE:My daughter may be no spring chicken, and her jaw might crack when she chews and she may have noticeable trouble digesting raw vegetables, but one thing she's not is mental.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, Ma.
SUPMALE:Ribs, great.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you just kick the dentures out of my mouth? We never had a barbecue in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf after the tragedy.
OTHERMALE:I guess we have to ask.
SUPFEMALE:No, we don't.
LEADMALE:She'll work it in anyway.
SUPFEMALE:What tragedy, Rose? I can't talk about it.
LEADMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:But it had to do with barbecuing elk, a big fire and someone who lost his balance.
SUPMALE:Got it.
LEADMALE:Clear as a bell.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now I know why Hemingway killed himself.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, girls, I have writer's block.
LEADFEMALE:It is the worst feeling in the world.
LEADFEMALE:Try ten days without a bowel movement sometime.
SUPFEMALE:You just sit there hour after hour after hour.
SUPMALE:Tell me about it.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't know what to do.
SUPMALE:I don't think there's any worse feeling in the world than facing that blank piece of paper.
SUPMALE:Tell me, how much have you written so far? Well, that's just it.
LEADMALE:Nothing.
LEADMALE:That's how I know I have writer's block.
SUPMALE:Blanche, you have to have written to have writer's block.
LEADFEMALE:Otherwise, all of us have it.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, maybe I ought to go to New York with you.
LEADMALE:New York is a writer's city.
LEADFEMALE:I could hang out at the Algonquin, talk to my colleagues, get the juices going.
LEADMALE:Honey, I'm going just for two days to see a doctor.
LEADMALE:I've asked Rose to go with me.
LEADFEMALE:Rose? Why her? She's comforting.
LEADMALE:And I'm not? You told me you were having a pedicure when your husband was dying.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course I was, Sophia.
LEADMALE:It was the third Thursday of the month.
SUPFEMALE:If I'd cancelled, that would have been it for July and August when I'd be wearing open-toed sandals.
SUPMALE:Angel of mercy.
LEADMALE:Well, I didn't know he was gonna pick that precise hour to die.
LEADFEMALE:How could I know that? Well, he was in a coma.
SUPMALE:Oh, he'd been in a coma for days.
LEADFEMALE:The fact is, I happen to be very good with sick people.
LEADMALE:I was once a candy stripper.
OTHERMALE:That's "striper.
LEADFEMALE:" Whatever.
LEADMALE:You know, a volunteer.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dorothy, I want to go to New York.
LEADMALE:How come Rose gets to go? Blanche, whenever I don't feel well, Rose makes me feel OK.
SUPFEMALE:What is she? Your best friend? Rose knows I'm sick.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I know you're sick.
SUPMALE:God knows you tell me all the time.
OTHERMALE:What a waste.
LEADMALE:Rose Nylund in New York.
SUPFEMALE:It's gonna be a great trip.
LEADFEMALE:You wait and see.
SUPFEMALE:You're gonna be cured.
SUPFEMALE:And I'm gonna get to see the Big Potato.
SUPFEMALE:I said she was comforting.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't say she was smart.
LEADFEMALE:So, what are you doing here? You've seen everybody.
LEADMALE:Nobody found anything wrong with you.
LEADFEMALE:And between their workups and mine, there are no more tests to run.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but I know Look, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Zbornak.
SUPMALE:Your main complaint is you're tired.
LEADMALE:I get tired too.
OTHERMALE:It's called getting old.
SUPFEMALE:Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Budd, that's not what this is.
SUPFEMALE:I am sick.
LEADFEMALE:I've had to give up my job because I was too tired to do it.
LEADMALE:How'd you get here? I flew.
SUPMALE:No, to my office.
SUPMALE:A taxi.
OTHERMALE:And from the taxi? What, how did I get from the taxi to your office? Not a hard question.
LEADMALE:I walked.
SUPFEMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:You walked.
SUPFEMALE:You're not sick, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:The people I see can't walk.
LEADFEMALE:They can't swallow.
OTHERMALE:Some of them can't breathe.
LEADMALE:Look, don't take this the wrong way, but have you ever thought about seeing a psychiatrist? I have seen two.
OTHERFEMALE:Here are their letters.
OTHERMALE:They both say there is nothing psychologically wrong with me.
SUPMALE:They believe it is physical.
LEADMALE:What the hell do they know? Psychiatry's not a science.
OTHERFEMALE:Then why did you suggest I see one? Because what you have is not scientific.
LEADMALE:What else was I going to do? Send you to New Mexico to a shaman? There's nothing wrong with you, Dorothy, except what happens to all of us.
LEADMALE:In case you haven't noticed, you're not 30.
LEADFEMALE:Take a cruise, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Go to a hypnotist.
LEADMALE:Change your hair color.
OTHERMALE:My wife became a blonde.
LEADFEMALE:She's a new woman.
LEADMALE:Yes, room service? Hello, this is Rose Nylund, and I'm staying here in your lovely hotel.
LEADMALE:Well, I think I need a new menu.
LEADMALE:Mine seems to be full of mistakes.
SUPFEMALE:For example, it says a small glass of tomato juice is six dollars.
SUPMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, room service, I'll have to call you back.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, what happened? Tell me, what did he say? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:He said exactly what everyone else did.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERMALE:That's terrible.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, I am so sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I thought surely he'd find something, so that you'd at least have a name for this thing.
SUPMALE:Oh, let's not talk about that.
SUPFEMALE:Tell me about your day.
LEADMALE:Oh, forget about my day.
OTHERMALE:He didn't say anything new? Nothing.
LEADMALE:Come on, now.
OTHERMALE:What did you do? You've never been here before.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think? I don't know how people live here, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it's all very interesting, and everything in the world is here, but it's so tall and so crowded and so noisy and so much.
LEADFEMALE:I've never seen so much of everything in my whole life.
SUPFEMALE:I went to Bloomingdale's
LEADMALE:the store.
LEADMALE:I swear St.
SUPMALE:Olaf could fit into it.
LEADMALE:I went to the top of the Empire State Building.
LEADMALE:You know what I don't understand? How come the fall didn't kill King Kong instantly? I mean, sure, he was big, but that's 102 stories.
SUPFEMALE:You look down  I know, it was a sad movie.
LEADMALE:I cried too.
OTHERFEMALE:Every time I see it I hope, "Maybe this time it'll be different.
LEADMALE:Maybe this time he won't die.
LEADMALE:" But he always does.
LEADMALE:It was only a movie, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:That was really a fake gorilla.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Rose, that's not it.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, what is it, Dorothy? What happened? Oh Maybe I am crazy.
OTHERFEMALE:Nobody believes me.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody thinks I'm crazy.
OTHERMALE:Maybe I am.
LEADMALE:Maybe I'm really crazy.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dorothy, you are not crazy.
LEADMALE:I mean, you are absolutely not crazy.
LEADMALE:I've seen the way you walk.
SUPMALE:I've seen how wiped out you get.
LEADMALE:You're not crazy, honey.
SUPMALE:You're sick.
SUPMALE:I think so too.
OTHERFEMALE:I really do, but nobody believes me.
LEADMALE:Doctors don't know everything, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, they think they do, but they don't.
OTHERMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, after all, Dr.
LEADMALE:Seuss was a doctor too.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna finish it tonight.
LEADMALE:I don't care if I never sleep a wink.
OTHERMALE:It's just like giving birth, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Once you get started, you can't stop.
LEADMALE:Actually, you can, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Ingrid Thurman stopped.
LEADFEMALE:What was she writing? She wasn't.
SUPMALE:She was giving birth to Hans and Franz, the twins.
LEADMALE:And she stopped right in the middle, right after Hans.
OTHERMALE:Well, what happened to Franz? He stayed in.
LEADFEMALE:For how long? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:A long time.
LEADFEMALE:They were a year apart in school.
OTHERMALE:That's impossible, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:No, it isn't.
LEADMALE:How is she? Wiped out and depressed, even though she tries to hide it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Sophia, she's gonna be OK, I know it.
LEADMALE:She will be, Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:Now, she's tough.
LEADMALE:You know, there are all sorts of things that people get that they can't diagnose.
LEADMALE:And then they disappear just as mysteriously as they came.
OTHERMALE:Gustav Ljungqvist got sick from something mysterious, and he nearly died.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he did die, in fact.
SUPFEMALE:Then at the cemetery, Beatrice Ljungqvist
LEADMALE:his wife
LEADMALE:kept screaming, "He's alive, he's alive! I can hear him from the grave!" Well, everybody thought it was the hallucinations of a grieving widow, so they sedated her.
LEADFEMALE:But when she woke up from her sedation, she told them that he said, from the grave, "We never paid our '78 through '86 income taxes.
SUPFEMALE:" And his partner said, "Only Gustav would know that.
SUPMALE:He must be alive.
LEADFEMALE:" So they all raced to the cemetery, and the entire town started digging like crazy
LEADFEMALE:kneeling by the grave, using their hands even, dirt flying and Beatrice screaming
OTHERFEMALE:and when they opened that coffin, there he was, dead as a doornail.
LEADFEMALE:What is the point of that ridiculous story, Rose? The point is Gustav didn't die from his mysterious disease at all.
LEADMALE:He lived and recovered.
LEADMALE:Trouble was, he recovered while he was buried, so by the time they got to him, he'd died of suffocation.
LEADMALE:I just don't believe these stories you tell, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:The other tragic aspect was the IRS was waiting at the cemetery to arrest Gustav's partner, Bergstrom.
LEADFEMALE:So Bergstrom killed himself right then and there, by grabbing the gun from Sheriff Tokvisten and shooting himself.
LEADFEMALE:What they did then was, since the grave was still open, and everybody was right there, and Gustav and Bergstrom had been partners, so they put Bergstrom in with Gustav and had a double burial.
SUPFEMALE:Unfortunately, later they found out that Bergstrom wanted to be cremated.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, shut up, Rose! I think the worst thing in the world is if your child dies before you do.
OTHERFEMALE:Sophia, Dorothy is not going to die.
OTHERMALE:I know that.
SUPMALE:She'll be fine.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you do that, Rose? Why do you make up stories? It wouldn't feel right to live anymore, you know? If a kid dies, it wouldn't feel fair to live.
OTHERFEMALE:Sophia, Dorothy's not dying.
OTHERMALE:How do you know, Rose? I know.
SUPMALE:Oh, now, honey, she's right.
OTHERFEMALE:I know too, and I'm a writer.
OTHERFEMALE:I see things more clearly than the average person.
LEADMALE:My perceptions are keener.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, knock it off, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Sophia, we have all seen our husbands die.
LEADFEMALE:We know what that is.
SUPMALE:Except for her.
LEADMALE:She was getting a manicure.
LEADMALE:Pedicure.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'm 80-something, and I've seen more death and dying than any of you.
LEADFEMALE:Over the past five months, we've seen a perfectly healthy, energetic woman waste away.
LEADFEMALE:She can't do anything anymore.
LEADMALE:So what difference does it make that they don't have a name for it yet? It's still something.
LEADMALE:There were lots of diseases they didn't have a name for.
LEADMALE:You think they had a name for the Black Plague when one guy had it? Thousands had to die before they knew what it was.
SUPMALE:Dorothy could be dying, and they just don't know it.
LEADMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:I have heart palpitations.
LEADMALE:I can't concentrate.
OTHERMALE:I forget things.
SUPMALE:I I get confused.
SUPMALE:Well, now I know what my destiny is, Rose.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna be a novelist.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I don't believe you're sick, but you do.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, I have writer's block.
LEADMALE:It is the worst feeling in the world.
LEADFEMALE:Try ten days without a bowel movement sometime.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody thinks I'm crazy.
LEADMALE:Maybe I am.
LEADMALE:There's nothing wrong with you, Dorothy, except what happens to all of us.
LEADFEMALE:In case you haven't noticed, you're not 30.
LEADMALE:Dorothy could be dying and they just don't know it.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Don't smash the Play-Doh.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:Well, as far as doctors go, you've certainly seen the best.
OTHERMALE:The best don't exist anymore.
OTHERMALE:The best are dead.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't know about that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:You're the exception, Harry.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't mean you.
SUPFEMALE:So do you think I'm crazy too? Dorothy, I think you're very sane.
LEADMALE:Just because a doctor hasn't found something doesn't mean there isn't something there.
OTHERMALE:Are you serious? How come you know that and they don't? First of all, I know you.
LEADFEMALE:You're a stable person.
LEADMALE:If you say you're sick, you probably are sick.
LEADMALE:Now, I want you to see Michael Chang.
SUPFEMALE:He's a virologist on staff here at the hospital.
LEADMALE:There are all kinds of diseases we didn't know about before.
SUPMALE:Look at Lyme disease.
LEADMALE:Harry, am I gonna die? I'm afraid so.
LEADMALE:Do you really think so? Sooner or later, I guarantee it.
SUPMALE:Unless, of course, the Japanese come up with something.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Here's his name and number.
LEADFEMALE:My God, what handwriting doctors have.
SUPFEMALE:I can't even read this, and I just wrote it Here it is.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Oliver.
LEADMALE:How are you gonna know it's not chicken soup? We don't keep chicken soup here.
SUPFEMALE:We only have vegetable soup.
LEADFEMALE:If that looks like vegetable soup, you're in a lot of trouble.
LEADFEMALE:How are you gonna know it's mine? Because I'll put your name on it.
LEADFEMALE:How old are you? Too old for you.
OTHERMALE:Has he been your doctor ever since you were little? He's not my doctor.
SUPMALE:He's my friend.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh, Oliver, Oliver! The bottle, please.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Listen, Harry.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:I can't tell you what it means to have someone like you believe me.
OTHERMALE:Give me that.
OTHERMALE:That's not his.
SUPFEMALE:He had Buddy Kline do it for him.
OTHERMALE:This is a proxy? He'll do it in his own bed, but there's something about doing it in a public place.
SUPFEMALE:Kinda like sex.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe where you come from.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, what the hell are you doing? I'm making omelets for us without yolk so we don't get too much cholesterol.
LEADMALE:That leaves these yolks, which I hate to throw out, so I thought we'd give them to the homeless.
SUPMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Give them egg yolks.
LEADFEMALE:They'll die of heart attacks.
LEADFEMALE:They won't need homes.
LEADFEMALE:Your heart's in the right place, Rose, but I don't know where the hell your brain is.
LEADFEMALE:Morning.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dorothy, you look terrific.
SUPMALE:Where are you going? To see that specialist that Harry recommended.
SUPMALE:Wipe off your makeup.
SUPMALE:What? You look too healthy.
LEADMALE:Maybe that's why they don't believe you.
SUPFEMALE:You don't look sick.
SUPFEMALE:She should go.
SUPFEMALE:They'd believe her.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, you look terrible.
LEADMALE:What day is this? I've been up for 72 hours.
LEADFEMALE:I had a breakthrough.
OTHERFEMALE:I discovered a new form of writing.
SUPFEMALE:I will go down in history.
OTHERMALE:First I wrote all day, then I tore it all up, and then that night it came to me, and the words poured forth like liquid from a stream.
LEADMALE:It was almost a mystical experience.
LEADMALE:Somebody else was writing this.
SUPFEMALE:Who? Everyman.
LEADFEMALE:This is everyman's work.
OTHERMALE:It's all gold.
LEADFEMALE:Just open it anywhere and the magic will touch you.
LEADMALE:But I'm so tired.
SUPMALE:I must sleep.
SUPMALE:And I cannot sleep.
LEADMALE:I am too tired to sleep.
SUPFEMALE:I will never sleep again.
SUPFEMALE:I may die from this.
SUPMALE:What am I gonna do? My God, I'm hallucinating.
LEADFEMALE:I see little balls of sunshine in a bag.
LEADMALE:Does this mean something? Those are egg yolks, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:My brain's gone.
LEADFEMALE:My body is limp with exhaustion.
LEADMALE:I suppose all the greats knew this feeling.
LEADFEMALE:And the thing is, after all this I've decided not to sell my book.
LEADFEMALE:It's too good to sell.
SUPMALE:They can publish it after I'm dead, like Vincent van Gogh.
LEADMALE:Van Gogh was a painter, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Whatever.
LEADMALE:It's all the same thing.
SUPFEMALE:We're all artists.
LEADFEMALE:We're all misunderstood.
LEADMALE:He cut off his hair.
LEADMALE:Maybe I'll cut off mine.
LEADMALE:He cut off his ear.
SUPMALE:I have too many earrings.
LEADMALE:We gotta go.
LEADFEMALE:I hate to leave.
LEADMALE:I've never seen a show like this before.
LEADMALE:Good luck, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I hope he finds something wrong with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I don't mean something wrong wrong.
LEADFEMALE:I mean something wrong so you know you're right when you know there's something wrong and you haven't been wrong all along.
LEADFEMALE:My God, I can't even understand people when they speak anymore, I'm so tired.
LEADMALE:What'd she just say, Dorothy? Was that a poem? Rose, make her lie down.
LEADFEMALE:I do try.
LEADFEMALE:I try, but I just pop right up again like one of those clowns you hit.
OTHERMALE:I'll never rest.
SUPMALE:I'll never rest again.
LEADMALE:Have a good time, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Buy me a present.
SUPMALE:I'll make you some nice hot milk and then we're gonna pile you into bed.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, you're my friend so I'm gonna let you read a few pages, but you have to give me your word you won't tell anyone.
LEADMALE:Your word.
LEADFEMALE:Of course.
LEADFEMALE:And then will you sleep? Whatever.
LEADMALE:I can trust you, I know I can.
OTHERMALE:You're from Minnesota.
OTHERMALE:People from Minnesota are honest.
LEADFEMALE:They don't lie.
LEADMALE:What could you possibly find to lie about on a farm? Must be some state.
LEADMALE:Lots of lakes and nice, pale people.
LEADMALE:I'd drown myself.
OTHERFEMALE:Read, Rose.
SUPMALE:Don't talk.
LEADFEMALE:I must publish a guide to go with my book.
LEADFEMALE:It's too full of references people could not possibly understand.
SUPMALE:It will be taught in universities.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, what is this? Yellow eyeballs are staring at me.
LEADMALE:Those are egg yolks, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, you are exhausted.
LEADMALE:You have to sleep.
LEADMALE:To sleep, perchance to dream.
SUPFEMALE:My God, what a wonderful line.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! I'm getting so good I can't stand it.
LEADMALE:I ought to write that in my book, that line.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think, Rose? What page are you on? To tell the truth, I don't understand any of this.
OTHERFEMALE:It doesn't seem to make any sense.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't make sense? Since when are you a literary critic, Rose Nylund? I'm not.
SUPFEMALE:You're from Minnesota.
LEADMALE:What have you read, for God's sake? Silas Marner? Paul Bunyan? Nothing.
LEADMALE:You know nothing.
SUPMALE:People from Minnesota are considered well-read if they get through the Sears catalog.
LEADFEMALE:Give me back my book.
OTHERMALE:This is why Hollywood won't get it either.
LEADMALE:I will not have my words coming out of Glenn Close's mouth.
LEADMALE:I'd rather die.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Blanche.
LEADMALE:We're gonna get you to bed.
LEADMALE:But it's my duty to the public.
OTHERMALE:No, I must have it published.
LEADFEMALE:It's my duty.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my God, I'm so tired.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, you can sleep right here, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me a story, Rose.
LEADMALE:That always puts me to sleep.
LEADMALE:It works every time.
LEADMALE:Just tell me one of your boring stories.
OTHERMALE:OK.
LEADMALE:I want you to know I'm crazy about Chinese people.
LEADMALE:Ma.
SUPMALE:It's a compliment.
LEADFEMALE:I am.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Mrs.
SUPMALE:Petrillo.
SUPFEMALE:Chinese people revere the elderly.
LEADMALE:In this country we throw away anything that's old.
OTHERMALE:But you people don't.
LEADMALE:That's a beautiful thing.
SUPFEMALE:You also have the most gorgeous hair in the world.
SUPFEMALE:Even when it's humid.
LEADMALE:Ma, please, let Dr.
LEADMALE:Chang read.
LEADMALE:It's OK, Mrs.
SUPMALE:Zbornak.
LEADFEMALE:I'm finished.
OTHERFEMALE:You've seen some wonderful doctors, but I really can't agree with their findings.
LEADMALE:There are new diseases arising all the time
LEADMALE:things we don't necessarily have tests for
LEADMALE:but that doesn't mean the diseases don't exist.
LEADMALE:See how terrific the Chinese are? With the most terrific food.
SUPMALE:Tasty, but not fattening.
SUPMALE:I don't care what anyone says.
LEADMALE:I don't get hungry an hour later.
SUPMALE:Ma, let Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Chang finish.
LEADFEMALE:I love Chinese checkers.
OTHERMALE:It's much better than plain checkers.
LEADMALE:And chopsticks
LEADFEMALE:what a great idea.
LEADMALE:Who knows what fork to use at a dinner party? Chopsticks, you don't feel like an idiot.
LEADMALE:Ma, enough! Dr.
LEADMALE:Chang, please.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I think that you are sick.
LEADFEMALE:I think you have something called chronic fatigue syndrome.
SUPMALE:It's fairly recent.
SUPMALE:There are many theories, but most of us believe it's a virus.
SUPFEMALE:It just has not been identified yet.
LEADMALE:The man's a genius.
LEADMALE:By the way, I loved Flower Drum Song.
LEADFEMALE:Doctors just kept telling me I was depressed.
SUPFEMALE:Depression can make a person feel tired, but it doesn't start suddenly, give you swollen glands, sore throat and all the other symptoms.
OTHERMALE:Now, there are certain blood tests, which we'll do, and if those results are abnormal that combined with the exclusion of the other diseases will compose a profile that actually thousands of people fit.
SUPMALE:So I really have something real? I would say you most certainly do.
SUPMALE:We should have our answers in a couple of weeks.
LEADMALE:How long will it last? I mean, will it go away? Does it get worse? Does anyone die from it? Well, no one has died from it.
SUPMALE:We don't know how long it lasts.
SUPMALE:Some people recover in months, some still have it after ten years, but that happens in other diseases as well.
OTHERFEMALE:You take multiple sclerosis.
LEADFEMALE:Some people have 20-year remissions, others wind up in wheelchairs.
OTHERMALE:There are variations.
LEADFEMALE:You're a genius.
SUPMALE:All your people are brilliant.
LEADFEMALE:The Chinese invented pasta, you know.
LEADFEMALE:We take credit for it, but we just added oregano.
LEADFEMALE:Well All I can say at this point is try to adapt to it.
OTHERMALE:Rest when you need to, eat well, eliminate stress if you can.
OTHERFEMALE:Right now there is no cure, and no one thing that relieves symptoms in everyone.
OTHERFEMALE:Right now I'm afraid you'll just have to live with it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, why didn't they tell me, all those doctors I saw? I'm sure some of them weren't familiar with it.
LEADFEMALE:The ones who have heard about it sometimes have trouble believing it exists, since they're not able to see it under their microscopes just yet.
LEADMALE:Those colleagues of mine, unfortunately, tend to blame the victim.
SUPMALE:I can't tell you what a relief this is.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure.
SUPMALE:Are there any other questions that I could answer for you? Not now, not that I can think of.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe later.
LEADFEMALE:Right now I can't even think straight.
LEADFEMALE:If there are no more questions, I'll order some blood work I have a question.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Petrillo.
OTHERMALE:When I order at Fung Chow's and say no MSG, do they really put it in anyway? I don't believe it.
SUPMALE:Another rejection.
LEADFEMALE:And this one isn't even personal.
SUPMALE:It's a form letter.
LEADFEMALE:They just filled in my name at the top, see? Oh, I'm so upset.
LEADFEMALE:I put everything into this, Rose, all of me, I held nothing back.
SUPFEMALE:Then to have some snotnosed little kid from Harvard send me a form letter, oh! I'm so mad I could scream.
OTHERFEMALE:That's the first time I ever heard anybody say "I'm so mad I could scream" and actually do it.
SUPMALE:It's like saying, "I laughed all the way to the bank.
LEADMALE:" I never saw anybody do that either.
OTHERMALE:I did all this work, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:I worked so hard.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I know you did, Blanche.
LEADMALE:All I ever wanted was to be special.
SUPMALE:I thought this would do it.
LEADMALE:I thought I'd publish a novel and I'd be special.
LEADFEMALE:'Course, I've always been special because of my looks, but they won't last forever.
SUPFEMALE:I have to be realistic
OTHERMALE:another 20 or 30 years.
LEADMALE:My face and body might start to go and then I'll have nothing to make me special.
LEADMALE:That's not what makes a person special, Blanche.
LEADMALE:You're special because you're a kind, decent, loving individual with a wonderful heart and a beauty that comes from your soul.
LEADFEMALE:That's that Minnesota crap again about the meaning of life.
LEADMALE:Well, Blanche, what else is there besides love and kindness? How about fame and fortune? That doesn't bring happiness.
LEADFEMALE:Like hell it doesn't.
OTHERMALE:You know, I'm getting sick of you knocking Minnesota.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we're not as sophisticated as Miami, maybe we don't have French boutiques and valet parking and face-lifts for Christmas vacation, but we have friends and family and a sense of community and caring, and that's pretty special.
SUPFEMALE:And our people are special too.
LEADMALE:And if we have farms, that's great.
LEADMALE:Without farms, you couldn't eat, and without eating, you wouldn't be able to go on a diet, and if you couldn't do that, what would you do for the rest of your life? Was I harsh? Ladies, drinks? Champagne.
LEADFEMALE:The best you have.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, that's so expensive.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up, Rose.
LEADMALE:This is my treat.
LEADFEMALE:It is a celebration.
SUPMALE:What are we celebrating? My daughter found out she has a debilitating disease.
SUPMALE:Oh! And it has a name.
SUPMALE:I am thrilled.
SUPFEMALE:We all are.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, of course.
SUPMALE:Congratulations.
SUPMALE:Champagne it is.
SUPMALE:I can't tell you what a relief it is to just be sick, not sick and crazy, and to know what I have, and that a lot of other people have the same thing.
SUPMALE:I don't like the name.
LEADFEMALE:I think it ought to have a better name.
LEADMALE:That's what Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Chang said.
LEADMALE:Chronic fatigue syndrome makes it sound like I'm just a tired person when it is so much more than that.
OTHERMALE:I think they should name it after you.
SUPFEMALE:Zbornak syndrome.
LEADFEMALE:Zbornak syndrome.
LEADFEMALE:That sounds like a chess move.
LEADMALE:Devereaux's disease has a nice ring to it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
SUPMALE:Oh, it was just a thought.
SUPMALE:It's him.
LEADMALE:Who? I can't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:I saw him first.
LEADFEMALE:Who is it? Where is he? It's Dr.
OTHERMALE:Budd, the neurologist I saw in New York.
LEADFEMALE:The one who told me I was just getting old and to go see a psychiatrist.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, don't make a scene.
LEADMALE:Order without me.
LEADMALE:Dr.
OTHERFEMALE:Budd? Yes.
SUPMALE:You probably don't remember me, but you told me I wasn't sick.
LEADFEMALE:Do you remember? You told me I was just getting old.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I really don't Remember.
LEADMALE:Maybe you're getting old.
SUPMALE:That's a little joke.
LEADMALE:Well, I tell you, Dr.
LEADMALE:Budd, I really am sick.
LEADMALE:I have chronic fatigue syndrome.
LEADMALE:That is a real illness.
SUPFEMALE:You can check with the Center for Disease Control.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, I'm sorry about that.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm glad.
LEADFEMALE:At least I know I have something.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure.
OTHERMALE:Well, nice seeing you.
SUPMALE:Not so fast.
LEADMALE:There are some things I have to say.
LEADFEMALE:There are a lot of things that I have to say.
SUPMALE:Words can't express what I have to say.
LEADMALE:What I went through, what you put me through I can't do this in a restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:But I will.
SUPFEMALE:Lewis, who is this person? Look, miss Sit.
SUPMALE:I sat for you long enough.
SUPMALE:Dr.
OTHERFEMALE:Budd, I came to you sick
LEADFEMALE:sick and scared.
LEADFEMALE:And you dismissed me.
LEADMALE:You didn't have the answer.
LEADFEMALE:Instead of saying, "I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what's wrong with you," you made me feel crazy, like I had made it all up.
LEADMALE:You dismissed me.
LEADMALE:You made me feel like a child, a fool, a neurotic who was wasting your precious time.
LEADMALE:Is that is that your caring profession? Is that healing? No one deserves that kind of treatment, Dr.
OTHERMALE:Budd, no one.
LEADMALE:I suspect, had I been a man, I might have been taken a little bit more seriously and not told to go to a hairdresser.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I am not going to sit here anymore-- Shut up, Lewis.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know where you doctors lose your humanity, but you lose it.
SUPMALE:If all of you at the beginning of your careers could get very sick and scared for a while, you'd probably learn more from that than anything else.
LEADFEMALE:You'd better start listening to your patients.
SUPFEMALE:They need to be heard.
SUPFEMALE:They need caring, they need compassion.
SUPMALE:They need attending to.
LEADMALE:Someday, Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Budd, you're gonna be on the other side of the table, and as angry as I am, and as angry as I always will be, I still wish you a better doctor than you were to me.
SUPMALE:Are you all right? I feel better than I have felt in a long time.
SUPFEMALE:To my friends who made being sick a little easier because they cared.
LEADMALE:Oh! This is the best champagne I've ever tasted.
SUPFEMALE:It should be.
LEADFEMALE:It's $430 a bottle.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, I can't afford that! You did say the best.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, for heaven's sake, you should have told me what it was.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, what am I gonna do? Just calm down.
LEADMALE:I'll show you an old Sicilian trick.
SUPFEMALE:This is how I grew up poor and managed to eat in the best restaurants in all of Italy.
OTHERMALE:Watch.
SUPFEMALE:Look, learn.
SUPMALE:It's awful! Swill! Is there a problem? You're supposed to take off your socks before you step on the grapes.
LEADMALE:Taste this.
SUPMALE:Oh, dear.
LEADMALE:Ladies, I'm terribly sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get you a new bottle.
SUPMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:It lingers on the palate.
LEADFEMALE:We won't be able to drink champagne for weeks.
LEADMALE:Well, at least let us pay for your meal.
LEADFEMALE:If you insist.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Now it's a celebration! 
LEADMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Morning.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you've already got breakfast ready.
LEADFEMALE:Becky and I were up till all hours talking.
LEADMALE:You know, my daughter and I haven't had a talk like that since ever.
LEADMALE:It must've been fun.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:We did each other's hair and laughed and laughed.
SUPFEMALE:I can see why.
LEADMALE:Ma, why are you still here? You were supposed to have your checkup with Dr.
SUPMALE:Siegel this morning.
LEADMALE:Oh, you didn't hear about Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Siegel.
SUPFEMALE:Hear what? I'm not going.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, you are impossible.
LEADFEMALE:Now, this is the third appointment you've missed.
LEADMALE:At my age, checkups can be dangerous to your health.
LEADFEMALE:You know Sam down the block, the one who thinks he's hiding his stomach by wearing Hawaiian shirts? Yeah, Sam is fine.
LEADMALE:His brother went for a checkup seven years ago.
LEADFEMALE:The doctor said he was great.
LEADFEMALE:Three days after the exam, he was dead.
LEADMALE:Ma, he owed money to a guy named Face and got thrown off a pier.
SUPFEMALE:That was one of the causes.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going.
OTHERFEMALE:You're going.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, could you give me a hand? Oh, sure.
LEADMALE:If you will excuse me, Becky and I are having breakfast on the lanai.
LEADMALE:We're still bonding.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, how come we never bond? We're from before bonding and quality time.
LEADMALE:We're from when people stayed together because they had no choice.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, would I be insisting on this checkup if I didn't care about you? Why can't we just do each other's hair like Blanche and her daughter? Oh, look, Ma.
LEADMALE:I know you're scared.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go with you.
LEADFEMALE:Look, when I was little, didn't you make me go and get all my shots? I had to lie to you and tell you we were going on the pony rides, and you fell for it time after time.
LEADMALE:Just like Pavlov's dog, only dumber.
LEADFEMALE:OK, OK, Ma, if you don't wanna go to the doctor, you don't have to go to the doctor.
LEADFEMALE:All right? I'll tell you what.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we spend tomorrow afternoon together? We'll work on our bonding.
LEADMALE:I'll take you to Wolfie's for an egg cream.
OTHERMALE:A chocolate egg cream? You betcha.
OTHERMALE:Oh, boy! A chocolate egg cream! Forget it, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I smell a pony ride.
SUPMALE:Oh, you know, I think this is the best visit we've ever had.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's because you've realized I'm a grown woman.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I never thought the day would come, but we are finally the same age.
SUPMALE:Why don't you stay longer? Oh, Mama.
LEADMALE:I can't stay because We're telling each other everything, right? Everything.
LEADMALE:No more secrets.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, good.
SUPFEMALE:Mama Mm-hmm? I'm getting impregnated on Monday.
SUPFEMALE:I've decided the best thing for me is to go to a sperm bank and get artificially inseminated.
LEADFEMALE:Why would you do something like this? Just to hurt me? Mama, try to understand.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't pass a carriage without looking in.
LEADFEMALE:I heard my biological clock ticking so loudly, it was keeping me up at night.
LEADFEMALE:A baby should be doing that.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why don't you wait till you get married? I don't wanna get married.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then at least wait until I'm dead.
OTHERMALE:You really mean that? Yes, I do.
LEADFEMALE:And wait until all my friends are dead, too.
LEADFEMALE:The last thing I need is whispering at my funeral.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you're reacting like this.
SUPFEMALE:We got so close this past week, I thought I could tell you anything.
LEADFEMALE:Anything but this.
LEADMALE:Well, Mama, I'm gonna do this whether you like it or not.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I see, missy.
OTHERMALE:So, this is the thanks I get for all those cold nights when you were a baby crying and I'd have to get up out of bed and grope around in the dark for my slippers and robe, make my way all the way downstairs and scream for the governess? Hungry or suicidal? It's not easy being the mother of a child with her own free will.
OTHERMALE:I knew I felt the refrigerator open.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong? You've been upset all day.
LEADMALE:It's Rebecca.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't understand.
LEADMALE:Why didn't somebody tell me it was dinnertime? Ma, it's not dinner, it's the middle of the night.
LEADFEMALE:Good, then I'm dressed for it.
SUPMALE:Blanche is upset.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you would be too, if your daughter Oh, I can't even say it.
LEADFEMALE:What could have happened? The two of you were getting so close.
LEADMALE:My little girl is gonna have a baby by artificial insemination.
LEADMALE:I just can't bear to think about it.
LEADMALE:I'm just being silly, aren't I? For God's sake, somebody say something! Eww.
LEADMALE:Big help.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, what about you? You're always the sensible one around here, the free, modern thinker who keeps up with the times.
SUPFEMALE:Now, what do you think? Eww.
SUPFEMALE:No wonder I'm up in the middle of the night working my way through the cheese keeper.
LEADMALE:Thank God I don't have the thighs of a normal woman.
OTHERFEMALE:I tried to talk her out of it.
SUPMALE:She says she has thought it through and there is no changing her mind.
LEADMALE:Well, it might not be so bad.
SUPMALE:In fact, just last week I was reading that you can buy the sperm of Nobel Prize winners.
SUPFEMALE:Or was it Star Search winners? Buy? Well, sperm used to be free.
SUPFEMALE:It was all over the place.
LEADMALE:On the farm a lot of the animals got artificially inseminated.
SUPFEMALE:Once Harry the bull went through a whole spring unaroused and the cows and my father were out of their minds with grief.
LEADMALE:I mean, you haven't seen anything till you've seen a frustrated cow.
LEADFEMALE:They can get this crazed look in their eye and you know they're thinking, "Where's mine?" "Where's mine?" Cows have feelings, too.
LEADMALE:Anyway, when Harry really got lazy Dad had to bring in Mr.
LEADMALE:Hoffenheisen to spread the seed.
LEADMALE:He did it in the most unusual way.
LEADFEMALE:He'd put on this really long rubber glove.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, that's a terrific story and surprisingly on-subject but I don't think that Blanche wants to hear about uncontented cows right now.
LEADMALE:It's not that I mind becoming a young grandmother again.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody believes it anyway.
OTHERMALE:Please.
LEADMALE:It's just that it seems so unnatural.
LEADMALE:No daddy for the baby.
LEADMALE:And no fun trying.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna have to agree with Blanche on this one.
LEADFEMALE:Half the fun is in getting there.
SUPFEMALE:And boy, did your father and I have fun trying for you.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, I don't think I wanna hear this.
LEADMALE:I wasn't gonna tell you until you're 60, but I think you can handle it now.
SUPMALE:We lived in New York at the time and there was the San Genarro festival every year.
LEADMALE:And your father, may he rest in peace until I get there, got so turned on by the festivities one year he couldn't wait till we got home.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Ma So he took me right there behind the sausage and pepper stand.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, we were behind the garbage cans.
OTHERMALE:It's not like we were in front of everybody.
LEADFEMALE:I can relate to the festivities part, Sophia.
LEADMALE:All our children were conceived on special St.
SUPFEMALE:Olaf holidays.
LEADFEMALE:Adam was conceived on the Day of the Princess Pig when they had the pig crowning, and Jeanella was conceived on Hay Day.
LEADFEMALE:That's the day we St.
OTHERMALE:Olafians celebrate hay.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, do you think you could wrap this up before Rebecca goes into labor? Then there was the Day of the Wheat when everybody came to town dressed as sandwiches.
SUPFEMALE:Charlie and I forgot to put cheese between us and before I knew it, there was Kirsten.
LEADMALE:Look, Blanche, what Rebecca is doing is really not so terrible.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, look, among the four of us, each of us conceived our children in a different way.
SUPMALE:I was totally unconscious.
LEADFEMALE:When I came to, there was Stan, carving a notch in his dashboard.
SUPMALE:I never bought that unconscious story.
LEADFEMALE:I swear.
LEADFEMALE:He must've slipped me something.
LEADMALE:Apparently.
SUPFEMALE:But at least what we all did was natural.
LEADFEMALE:Well, not all the time.
LEADMALE:There's some other stuff, but I probably shouldn't tell you till you're 70.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, Becky.
OTHERFEMALE:Have you seen my mother? She mentioned something about having a headache.
OTHERMALE:I think she's in her room.
LEADMALE:Hanging herself.
SUPMALE:Oh, hi, everybody.
LEADMALE:Oh, how are you feeling? Oh, much better.
LEADFEMALE:Say, how about going out to dinner? Have some fun.
LEADFEMALE:Mama, can we talk for a minute? I'll make the reservations.
LEADFEMALE:Where would you like to eat? I want you to be part of the process.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Becky.
LEADMALE:Honey, I think you are headed for trouble, going off by yourself like this.
SUPMALE:No man is gonna want to marry you with a baby.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, there are a lot of people who are single parents and they're doing just fine.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, look at me.
LEADMALE:The right man could be just around the corner.
LEADMALE:And he may not be.
LEADFEMALE:I may turn around a dozen corners and not find anyone.
LEADMALE:So, instead of trying, you're just gonna give up and do this crazy baby thing? "Crazy baby thing"? What I am doing, Mother, is taking control of my life and having the family I need.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I would certainly never have a baby artificially and I do not approve of you doing it either! Well, if that's the way you want it, Mama, then you're gonna lose me and your grandchild.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, there you are.
SUPMALE:Ma, I scheduled the appointment for your checkup.
OTHERMALE:Ma, you know you have to have a physical.
SUPFEMALE:What do you want me to do? Take you to court? Have you declared incompetent? I'm not incompetent.
LEADFEMALE:Once when I laughed too hard, I had a little accident.
LEADMALE:Can I fix you some breakfast, honey? No, thanks.
LEADMALE:Oh, I just feel terrible.
SUPFEMALE:If I'm gonna spend the night tossing and turning at least I wanna wake up smelling like aftershave.
LEADFEMALE:Morning.
LEADMALE:Good morning, Rebecca.
LEADMALE:I got up early and did some research.
LEADFEMALE:There's a sperm bank not far from here.
SUPMALE:How convenient.
LEADFEMALE:No kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Do they have a drive-up window? I thought, Mama, that we could go down there and once you see these places are legitimate, you won't be so upset.
SUPMALE:I don't want to go to a place like that.
SUPFEMALE:It's too embarrassing.
LEADFEMALE:What if one of the neighbors saw me going in? What would they think? That you're picking something up for a much younger person.
OTHERFEMALE:Mama, please.
OTHERFEMALE:It's really important to me.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, would it help if I were to go with you? Well I'll come too.
SUPMALE:I'll bring my camera.
LEADMALE:It's never too soon to start a baby book.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy, we're going to a sperm bank.
LEADFEMALE:I can't think of a better way to pep up a slow day.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you're not going.
SUPMALE:Why not? I don't think you should be doing anything as strenuous as going to a sperm bank until you've had that checkup.
LEADMALE:Too bad.
SUPMALE:All right, I'll go to the doctor, but this better be a great sperm bank.
LEADFEMALE:So, I guess we're going? Oh, I guess.
OTHERFEMALE:What does one wear to a sperm bank? Something attractive in rubber.
LEADFEMALE:I have that.
LEADFEMALE:Did you see the way those people on the elevator looked at us when you pushed "5"? I'm so embarrassed.
LEADFEMALE:Mama, they didn't look at us at all.
OTHERMALE:They didn't want to make eye contact with anybody going to the fifth floor
LEADFEMALE:the sperm floor.
OTHERMALE:I think you're overreacting.
SUPFEMALE:Perverts looked at us like we were perverts.
SUPMALE:I know that look.
OTHERMALE:I thought it'd be more bank-like.
LEADFEMALE:What did you expect, Rose? I hardly think they have a Christmas club.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I'm Rebecca Devereaux.
LEADMALE:We have an appointment with Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Manning.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:He'll be with you in just a few minutes.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you have a seat and I'll call you when he's ready.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not here for me.
LEADMALE:It's for a friend.
LEADMALE:How did things go at the doctor's, Sophia? He said I have the body of a 40-year-old.
OTHERFEMALE:A dead 40-year-old.
LEADFEMALE:The doctor's gonna be a little while.
LEADMALE:I guess we oughta sit down.
SUPMALE:I suppose it's safe.
SUPFEMALE:Mama, you're acting silly.
SUPMALE:Sperm can't live outside the human body.
LEADMALE:Does your mother know you're doing this for a living? You know, I'm not so sure sperm can't live outside the body.
SUPFEMALE:Back during World War II, my best friend Claire Osterhaus's husband was in the army and stationed in France.
LEADFEMALE:Well, five months after he left St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf, she got pregnant.
LEADMALE:A lot of people thought she was fooling around, but she told me that sperm must have swum from Normandy.
SUPMALE:Across the Atlantic, up the St.
SUPMALE:Lawrence Seaway, into the Great Lakes and then over to Minnesota.
LEADMALE:And what did you think, Rose? Well, I know those little guys are supposed to be good swimmers but I think it had to come over by mail.
SUPMALE:I bet this is more fun than giving blood.
SUPMALE:I've waited long enough.
SUPMALE:That doctor has wasted enough of my time.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Miss Devereaux, the doctor will see you now.
SUPMALE:Through that door, end of the hall.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mama.
OTHERFEMALE:Eyes straight, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, no opening doors.
LEADFEMALE:And that's pretty much the procedure.
LEADMALE:Rebecca will be taken care of by her own doctor after selecting a donor from thousands of acceptable possibilities.
LEADFEMALE:Any questions? Plenty.
LEADMALE:Can just anybody walk in off the street and make my daughter pregnant? We screen the applicants very carefully.
LEADMALE:We know everything about them.
LEADFEMALE:We know their body type, their IQ, their eye color Any more questions? Yes, just one.
LEADMALE:What in hell are we doing here? I feel like I'm in the middle of some awful dream, yet I know it can't be a dream 'cause there are no boy dancers.
LEADFEMALE:Mother! I just cannot believe you are actually gonna give money to someone like this sperm pusher.
OTHERFEMALE:You are a Devereaux.
SUPMALE:A Devereaux has never had to pay for it.
LEADFEMALE:I certainly haven't.
OTHERFEMALE:She's always depended on the kindness of strangers.
SUPMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Make jokes.
SUPFEMALE:I'd just like to know how you-all would feel if you thought you were gonna have a test tube for a son-in-law.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, Doctor.
SUPFEMALE:I thought my mother was open enough to understand.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you for your time.
LEADFEMALE:Ladies.
SUPFEMALE:Just outta curiosity, you don't have any Tony Bennett socked away, do you? Blanche, your daughter is about to leave for the airport.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell are you doing out here? Well, there's still some sun.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I might get a little color.
SUPMALE:Blanche, this has to be absolutely the dumbest thing you could possibly do.
LEADMALE:Dorothy's right.
LEADMALE:The sun's rays can be dangerous now there's a hole in the ozone layer.
LEADMALE:If you-all are out here to try to get me to patch things up with Rebecca, you can forget it.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, there comes a time when you have to let your daughter make her own decisions.
LEADMALE:I remember, Dorothy, when you were deciding what you wanted to be.
SUPMALE:Ah, yeah.
LEADMALE:I wanted to go to college and be a schoolteacher.
LEADMALE:Pop wanted me to be a cosmetician in a funeral parlor.
SUPFEMALE:He always liked looking at dead people.
LEADMALE:Dead people and the Dodgers.
OTHERFEMALE:That was it for him in the good-time department.
SUPFEMALE:Sometimes, just to make him happy, I used to lie in bed with a baseball hat on.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, the point is, she let me make my own choices.
SUPMALE:Now, this argument that you're having with Rebecca is not about artificial insemination.
SUPMALE:Like hell it isn't.
SUPMALE:Well, part of it is, but the bigger part, Blanche, is about control.
LEADMALE:You refuse to see your daughter as an adult with the right to make her own decisions.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, you're gonna have to learn to let go.
OTHERMALE:Yes, and the more you try to make her see things the way you see things, the more she'll resist, and then you run the risk of never seeing her again.
OTHERFEMALE:And never seeing your grandchild.
OTHERFEMALE:Never.
LEADFEMALE:Think about it, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, damn, I don't want that to happen.
SUPMALE:Then I suggest you apologize.
OTHERMALE:I know Rebecca is a grown woman, but to me she's still just a little girl.
LEADFEMALE:How do you say "I'm sorry" to your own child? Especially after all those years of sending them to their room until they were ready to apologize to you.
LEADFEMALE:Now all of a sudden everything's just all topsy-turvy.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know if I can do it.
LEADMALE:Maybe it'd help if I sent you to your room.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Rebecca.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, honey Oh I'm  I'm I Oh, come on, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Say it.
LEADFEMALE:"I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:" There.
LEADMALE:What she just said.
LEADMALE:Oh, there.
LEADMALE:I knew you could do it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I've just been so dumb about this whole thing.
LEADFEMALE:I should've respected what you wanted to do.
OTHERMALE:You really mean that? Yes, I do.
LEADMALE:Let me drive you to the airport and we'll think up baby names on the way.
LEADMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:I'll go get rid of the cab.
OTHERMALE:Oh Blanche, Blanche, you did the right thing.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:You girls were right.
OTHERMALE:And, hey, listen.
LEADFEMALE:If my daughter wants to get herself artificially inseminated, I guess that's not so bad.
SUPFEMALE:Eww.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, your father's on the phone.
LEADMALE:Ma, Pop's been dead for 15 years.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're right.
LEADMALE:I'm getting old.
OTHERMALE:I meant, what's for dinner? Mail call.
LEADMALE:Rose.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Here you go, Sophia.
SUPMALE:Oh, I finally got my membership card from the Shoppers Warehouse store.
LEADMALE:Gloria at the museum shops there, but don't you have to buy everything in large quantities? So what? They give you great bargains.
SUPFEMALE:Wow, look at this.
LEADMALE:If you buy ten boxes of adult diapers, they're only eight dollars a box.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, you don't wear diapers.
SUPFEMALE:A lot of my friends do.
LEADMALE:I'll load up now and keep them for stocking stuffers.
LEADFEMALE:This is terrible.
LEADFEMALE:Trick move from your checkers-by-mail partner? No, it's from the company Charlie worked for.
SUPMALE:They've gone bankrupt and so has their pension fund.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not gonna be getting pension checks anymore.
SUPMALE:I can't afford to live without that pension.
SUPFEMALE:Well, honey, now, let's not panic.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sure they can't just cut you off.
OTHERFEMALE:She's right.
OTHERMALE:There has to be a good explanation.
LEADMALE:Honey, you'll call them tomorrow, everything will be fine.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what if it's not? What if I can't pay my own way? What if I can't afford food? What if I have to sleep outside in some park? You know, there's an old Italian saying for times like 
LEADMALE:"Scapa, tu si mal fortuna.
LEADMALE:" What does that mean? Get away from me, you're bad luck.
LEADMALE:Rose, you're home early.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I called Charlie's company today and it turns out they have a legal right to cut off the pension.
SUPMALE:Well, I don't make enough at the counseling center to live without that pension, so I figured I'd better get a new job.
SUPFEMALE:I'm helping her look.
LEADFEMALE:We're going through the classifieds and cutting out ads that might be of some interest to her.
LEADMALE:"Single white male seeks traveling companion.
OTHERFEMALE:" "Tour of European cathedrals.
LEADFEMALE:No prudes.
SUPMALE:" That's my pile.
LEADFEMALE:What a day.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this.
LEADMALE:Toothbrushes, 39 cents each.
OTHERFEMALE:I bought four gross.
SUPFEMALE:Anybody in the mood to remove some plaque? Oh, Ma, you have almost 600 toothbrushes here.
LEADMALE:People don't use that many in a lifetime, and at your age Please, I'm way ahead of you.
LEADMALE:I bought half pink, half blue, so after I'm gone, you and your brother Phil won't fight to see who gets them.
LEADFEMALE:So that's what it feels like to be an heiress.
LEADMALE:You're not cutting up the obituaries, are you? I wanna make sure my canasta game is still on for tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:I'm looking for a job.
SUPMALE:They cut off Charlie's pension.
LEADMALE:He's dead.
LEADMALE:How much does he need? You know what gets me mad about this whole thing? All those years Charlie put into that job just for the pension.
SUPFEMALE:He used to say, "Rose, I hate selling horseshoes, but if I do it long enough, you'll be set for life.
SUPFEMALE:" Your husband sold horseshoes? I thought he sold insurance.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, he sold insurance for a while, but Charlie wasn't very good at it.
LEADMALE:As soon as people said no, he'd give up.
LEADFEMALE:Insurance salesmen have to keep going till they get a yes.
LEADFEMALE:They have to keep talking and talking and talking, even if people aren't listening.
SUPFEMALE:He should have taken you with him.
LEADMALE:Anyway, after he was fired, he worked for an iron company.
LEADFEMALE:He sold other things, but horseshoes were his specialty.
SUPMALE:He had a sense of humor about it.
LEADFEMALE:We couldn't pass a horse without Charlie 
SUPFEMALE:"Can I show you something in an Oxford?" Ah, then he'd laugh and I'd laugh.
LEADMALE:Sometimes, even the horse would laugh.
LEADFEMALE:With them or at them? Ma! You know what you should do? Call what's-his-name.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, could you narrow that down a bit? The what's-his-name on TV, on the news, the one who glues his head to the ceiling.
SUPMALE:Oh, I think she means that consumer reporter on Channel 8.
SUPFEMALE:Enrique Mas.
LEADFEMALE:That's the guy.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, that's not such a bad idea.
SUPMALE:He helps a lot of people.
OTHERFEMALE:I believe he must be the best consumer reporter ever.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't realize you were such a fan.
SUPMALE:Oh, my.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Enrique Mas is a great champion of the people.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, he has all that gorgeous black hair.
OTHERFEMALE:And those swarthy Latin good looks and the sexy way he rolls his r's.
SUPFEMALE:Enrique.
LEADMALE:Boy, I'd love to get him on a couch made out of Corinthian leather.
SUPFEMALE:The woman has such lofty ambitions.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for the suggestion, Sophia, but there's really nothing Enrique Mas can do.
SUPFEMALE:They have the legal right to cut off the pension.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'll just have to get out there tomorrow and start looking for a job.
LEADMALE:Be sure you dress youthfully.
LEADFEMALE:How come? You're old.
LEADFEMALE:Let's face it, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Companies are not falling all over themselves to hire women your age.
SUPMALE:I wonder why it is people don't like to hire older women? Probably makes them feel uncomfortable.
LEADFEMALE:You know, they feel like they're bossing their mothers around.
SUPMALE:Ma, stop that! It's understandable.
SUPFEMALE:Pussycat, can you lend me $20? Ma, this is the second time this week that you've come to me for money.
SUPMALE:Now, what happened to your allowance? Something's come up.
SUPMALE:A medical emergency.
OTHERMALE:Can I have the money? What medical Ma, what's wrong? I think I'm pregnant.
SUPFEMALE:What happened? The rabbit died laughing? What do you need the money for? They're having a special at Shoppers Warehouse.
LEADFEMALE:It's something I really need.
LEADMALE:What? Tube socks.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, you know, this is how Imelda Marcos got started with that shoe thing.
SUPMALE:Now, Ma, what is going on? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:It makes me feel good.
LEADMALE:In a strange way, shopping there makes you feel immortal.
OTHERMALE:I don't follow.
LEADFEMALE:Let's say you buy 20 cases of sardines.
LEADMALE:This better be just an example.
LEADFEMALE:Of course.
SUPFEMALE:You get 20 cases of sardines, you 
LEADFEMALE:"God doesn't want me to waste good sardines.
LEADMALE:" "He's gonna wait till I finish the 20 cases.
LEADFEMALE:" That could take five, six years.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, why couldn't you just eat one case slowly? Silly, isn't it? What in the hell are all those sardines doing in the kitchen? Oh, Ma! Wait till you're my age.
LEADFEMALE:We'll see what kind of straws you clutch at.
LEADMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADFEMALE:How did it go? Not so good.
LEADMALE:I looked all day and came up with nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I'm beat.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey.
LEADMALE:Come on, sit down.
LEADMALE:Relax.
LEADFEMALE:Can I get you a sardine sandwich? Maybe later.
LEADMALE:I knew it would be rough looking for a job, but not this rough.
LEADMALE:You didn't find anything? Oh, I found one job I wanted.
LEADFEMALE:I would have been perfect for it, but they told me I was too old.
LEADMALE:What kind of job? Assistant manager in a pet store.
SUPMALE:I don't know why they didn't hire me.
SUPFEMALE:I worked in a pet store in St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf for ten years.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I was the one who thought up big, squeaky toys for cows.
LEADMALE:You didn't tell them that, did you, Rose? I didn't have a chance.
LEADMALE:Before I could tell them my qualifications, they told me I was too old.
LEADMALE:Well, they can't do that.
LEADFEMALE:That is age discrimination.
SUPMALE:Rose, you can fight this.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean? What should I do? I don't wanna make a fuss.
LEADMALE:Well, then, call Enrique Mas and let him make your fuss for you.
SUPMALE:Right there on television.
SUPFEMALE:You gotta stand up for your rights, Rose.
LEADMALE:All right, maybe I'll call.
LEADMALE:Rose.
OTHERMALE:Well, I just feel overwhelmed.
LEADMALE:How could this have happened? Charlie and I were so careful with our money.
LEADMALE:We saved.
LEADMALE:We never splurged.
LEADMALE:OK, one year, we went to Chicago to tour the stockyards.
LEADFEMALE:But it was our 20th anniversary.
SUPMALE:We had a romantic trip coming.
LEADMALE:You must have been the envy of every woman in St.
OTHERFEMALE:Olaf.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it was more than the stockyards.
LEADMALE:We even got to see where Crisco is made.
LEADMALE:The point is, we thought I'd have enough money for the rest of my life, as long as I had his pension.
SUPMALE:Now the reality is I probably have enough for only a couple of months.
OTHERMALE:What's with the sardines? Ma, how are we going to get rid of all of this? Don't worry.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow, we're getting five cases of pickled onions.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, life sure has a way of throwing you curve balls.
LEADFEMALE:When I was younger, I never would have imagined that I'd be worrying about money at this stage of my life.
LEADFEMALE:I used to think Stan would take care of me.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we didn't have much saved, but he was a darn good novelty salesman.
LEADMALE:Sounds naive now to think that I placed my hopes for the future on a bald pinhead with the morals of a maggot who made his living selling plastic dog-doo.
LEADFEMALE:Well, at least I'm not bitter.
LEADFEMALE:I always assumed I'd be kept by a younger man.
LEADMALE:It's not too late.
LEADMALE:They get younger every day.
SUPMALE:I don't know what I'm gonna do.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know how much longer I'll be able to pay the rent.
SUPMALE:I can't live here anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I won't hear any more of this.
SUPMALE:You will call Enrique Mas and you will get that job at the pet store that you deserve.
LEADFEMALE:And you will stay here with us as long as we can afford it.
LEADFEMALE:She's right.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, you have to fight this.
SUPMALE:You know, every morning, when I leave the house, I see this bag lady going through the garbage over on 135th Street.
SUPMALE:She has everything she owns piled in one of those old shopping carts.
LEADMALE:Well, the other day, for the first time, I noticed she's about our age.
SUPMALE:You know, you always feel sorry for someone like that, but I wondered, what did she do to get herself into a fix like that? I thought, well, she must be lazy.
LEADFEMALE:Or she must be pretty stupid to let something like this happen to her.
LEADFEMALE:But the truth is she's me.
LEADMALE:God, what am I gonna do? Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Can I help you? Rose Nylund, to see Terry Franco.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Nylund.
LEADMALE:I'm Terry.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:It was so nice of Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Mas to see me on such short notice.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Maybe you misunderstood me on the phone.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be helping you.
LEADFEMALE:Enrique will get involved and put you on TV only if your age discrimination case gets really ugly and the company tries to discredit you, drag your name through the mud and make you look stupid.
LEADFEMALE:I guess we can only hope.
LEADMALE:OK, I'll need to get some information from you.
LEADMALE:Terry, are there any applicants for the new production assistant's job coming in this afternoon? They'll be here at two.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:How do you do, madam? I am  Enrique Mas.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Nylund is here on an age-discrimination complaint.
OTHERMALE:I can assure you, I will try very hard to help you.
LEADFEMALE:Could I ask you something? I heard you mention you're gonna be hiring a new production assistant.
SUPMALE:Could I apply for that job? I'm a big fan of yours and I respect your work.
LEADFEMALE:I know I'd be terrific.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:But I'm afraid you're just not the right type.
LEADFEMALE:The job requires someone with great energy and drive and quite frankly, someone of your advanced age Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:I'm here on an age-discrimination case and you're telling me I'm too old? Oh, it is not me.
SUPMALE:It is  Enrique Mas.
LEADMALE:I'm confused.
LEADFEMALE:Please, let me explain.
OTHERFEMALE:You see, there are two mes.
LEADFEMALE:There is Enrique Mas, the dedicated consumer advocate, fighting for justice and equality.
LEADMALE:And then there is  Enrique Mas, the television personality who wants to get out of this local station and onto the networks so he can become a really big fish in a big pond.
LEADMALE:It is  Enrique who has  reservations.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:You're a fake.
SUPMALE:I am not a fake.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Nylund, ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to be on TV.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know what that's like for a Hispanic kid? Who were my role models? Zorro and Ricky Ricardo.
LEADMALE:A gay caballero and a man who couldn't recognize his own wife in a fake mustache.
LEADFEMALE:I swore that if I ever got on TV, I would maintain the highest standards.
LEADMALE:Enrique Mas demands the best.
LEADFEMALE:Well, hold it right there! You can't write me off just because I'm not 30-something.
LEADMALE:I have experience.
LEADFEMALE:And wisdom.
LEADFEMALE:And insight.
LEADFEMALE:I'd be perfect for this job.
LEADMALE:You see, I am the battered consumer.
LEADMALE:I drive a Gremlin, for God's sake.
SUPFEMALE:I tell you what I'll do.
SUPMALE:Will you accept a test? You bet.
SUPMALE:One of the most important parts of this job is product testing.
LEADFEMALE:I will give you a test to do at home.
SUPFEMALE:You will bring in the results, and I will see how you do.
SUPFEMALE:But I must warn you, both Enrique Mas and  Enrique Mas demand that the results be accurate in every detail.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you very much, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Mas.
SUPFEMALE:You can call me  Enrique.
SUPMALE:No, I don't think I can.
LEADMALE:I don't know how to thank you all for helping me with this test.
LEADMALE:Pay us.
LEADMALE:Ma! It's our pleasure, Rose.
LEADMALE:OK, what we have to do is try these different hair-removal products, evaluate their advantages and disadvantages and see which one gets our legs the smoothest.
SUPMALE:Sophia, why don't you try the regular razor? Dorothy, would you like to try this thing? What is it? Well, that wire vibrates and it's supposed to whisk hair away from below the skin line.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know whether I wanna use this.
OTHERMALE:It says it's gonna hurt.
LEADMALE:Well, you can try it on your right leg and then use the hot wax on your left one.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't we just set each other on fire? Dorothy.
LEADMALE:All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see if they sent a bullet to bite on.
LEADFEMALE:Your choice, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Razor or cream remover? Cheesecake.
LEADMALE:This reminds me of the first time I ever shaved my legs.
SUPFEMALE:It was at a slumber party when I was 11 years old.
LEADFEMALE:What's a slumber party without snacks? Instead of cheesecake, let's have oatmeal cookies.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Because we have so many of them.
OTHERMALE:Ma, you didn't.
LEADMALE:I did.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:That's it! No more! Now, I know that you feel that shopping at Shoppers Warehouse is some kind of a religious experience for you, but I absolutely forbid you to ever go there again.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Does this mean no cookies? Well, as long as we own them Blanche, did you really start shaving at 11? That seems so young.
LEADMALE:Oh, I did it on a dare.
SUPFEMALE:You know, back where I come from, everybody thought that once you started shaving your legs, why, you'd become loose.
LEADFEMALE:So I shaved 'em.
LEADMALE:What happened? Oh, it was an old wives' tale.
LEADMALE:I didn't become loose for another year and a half.
SUPMALE:I remember when I started shaving.
OTHERMALE:I was 13, and I wanted to shave because I was going to a movie with Alan Steckler.
LEADMALE:You remember him, Ma? Small head, enormous lips.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, Ma told me that, once I started shaving, I'd never be able to stop.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, she said I'd regret it for the rest of my life because my legs would have bristles.
OTHERFEMALE:I was right.
LEADMALE:By the time you were 16, I could grate cheese on your knees.
LEADMALE:When did you start, Sophia? Oh, late.
LEADFEMALE:Not till I came to this country.
LEADMALE:In my village, hairy legs were a sign of beauty.
SUPMALE:How do you account for that? Dumb men, hairy women.
OTHERMALE:Actually, that's not such a big surprise.
LEADMALE:You know, a lot of those European girls don't shave under their arms.
LEADMALE:Is that true? They just let it all hang out.
OTHERMALE:Really? Bushy as can be.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what do they look like in a strapless dress? Like Milton Berle, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:There's nothing wrong with it.
LEADMALE:It's perfectly natural.
LEADMALE:Well, it's a little too natural if you ask me.
LEADFEMALE:I prefer to be smooth under my arms and from my ankle to the top of my thigh.
SUPMALE:Get outta here.
LEADMALE:What? You shave above the knee? Well, of course.
LEADMALE:Get outta here.
LEADFEMALE:Surely, Rose, you have heard of women shaving above the knee? Get outta here.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, you say that one more time and we will.
LEADMALE:I never heard of anything like that before.
LEADFEMALE:When men see that you shave your legs above the knee, what does that say to them? Hopefully, it says, "Touch my leg.
LEADFEMALE:" That's in case they miss the tattoo that says the same thing.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, my mother would kill me if I ever did that.
LEADFEMALE:She never wanted me to shave at all.
LEADMALE:By the time I got to high school, the kids had made up this really mean nickname for me just because I had hairy legs.
OTHERFEMALE:What did they call you? Rose with the hairy legs.
LEADFEMALE:Kids can be so cruel.
LEADMALE:It's almost dinnertime.
LEADFEMALE:Now, what could be taking Rose so long at that job interview? I mean, if she's taking this long, that's a good sign, isn't it? I mean, how long does it take to say no? What are you asking her for? She never said no in her life.
LEADFEMALE:You know, just to be on the safe side, when she gets home, we shouldn't ask her what happened.
LEADFEMALE:We should just keep the conversation in a positive direction.
LEADFEMALE:That is a very good point.
LEADMALE:I mean, she might be totally devastated.
LEADMALE:So no matter how bad the news, let's just smile and show her that we believe in her.
LEADFEMALE:Guess what.
SUPFEMALE:Aw.
SUPFEMALE:No, I got the job.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, that's wonderful! I don't know how to thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Enrique Mas said my report was accurate and concise and very professional.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's so exciting.
OTHERMALE:Tomorrow, I start comparing artificial sweeteners.
LEADFEMALE:And next week, I get to test crash helmets.
LEADFEMALE:You will leave us out of that one, won't you, Rose? Oh, that's wonderful, honey.
LEADMALE:That's just wonderful.
LEADMALE:You know what the best part is? I get to stay here.
LEADFEMALE:That's what worried me most.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I don't think I ever really doubted that somehow I'd wind up on my feet, but what worried and scared me was that I'd have to leave my friends and my family.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey.
SUPFEMALE:It scared me too, but I told you you were welcome-- OK, OK, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Get washed up.
SUPMALE:Rose, I knew you'd get that job, so I made a special dinner to celebrate.
LEADMALE:Sophia, that's so nice.
LEADFEMALE:Don't mention it.
LEADFEMALE:When I was shaving my legs last night, it really made me feel good.
OTHERFEMALE:That you were helping Rose? That I can still touch my ankles.
LEADFEMALE:What did you make that's so special? Sardine casserole with kind of an oatmeal cookie crust.
LEADMALE:I hope you like it.
LEADFEMALE:There's a lot.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I tell you, there is nothing more invigorating than spending a little time on a boat.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? Not when I sailed to America.
LEADFEMALE:Picture it.
LEADMALE:There we were
LEADMALE:a tired, poor, huddled mass eating marinara sauce out of a can.
SUPFEMALE:It was hell.
LEADFEMALE:And the entertainment? Some guy from Palermo forgot his accordion, so he sat around singing "0 Solo Mio" while squeezing a monkey.
LEADMALE:Sophia.
SUPMALE:Sophia what? It was the worst time of my life.
SUPFEMALE:If it weren't for pin the tail on the French, we would've gone stir-crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, I was just telling Sophia what a wonderful day we had.
LEADMALE:Wonderful, my foot.
LEADMALE:Blanche, you saw that dolphin.
SUPFEMALE:All tangled up in that tuna boat's net.
LEADFEMALE:Thousands of them die that way each year.
LEADMALE:We have to do something.
SUPMALE:You are absolutely right.
LEADMALE:From this moment on, no more tuna fish.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, you hate tuna fish.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Then no more tuna fishermen.
LEADMALE:Hi, girls.
OTHERFEMALE:Do these pearls look OK with this? Honey, pearls look fine with everything, from the fanciest dress to that.
LEADFEMALE:You have another date with Ken.
LEADMALE:Oh, Sophia, do you believe it? And I thought my head was spinning from the splash of vino in my lemonade.
OTHERMALE:Sophia, you don't put wine in your lemonade.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:I don't.
LEADFEMALE:It was a joke.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha.
OTHERFEMALE:Your Ken is quite a catch, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:For once I'm a bit jealous.
SUPFEMALE:What's not to be jealous about? The man's gorgeous.
LEADMALE:He's got money and class.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't be happier for you, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:I just want to give you a loving mother's 
SUPFEMALE:Don't blow it! Ma, I have no intention of blowing this.
LEADFEMALE:No, Ken is perfect.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, aside from being one of Miami's most successful lawyers Thank you, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:The man is caring.
LEADMALE:He's sensitive.
SUPMALE:Do you know that on weekends, he actually puts on a clown's costume and entertains sick kids at the hospital?  I mean, what more could I want from a man? Get it out of the gutter, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:How was your day? My ulcer didn't flare up and I'm having dinner with you.
LEADFEMALE:So I guess it's perfect.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Ken.
LEADMALE:Hey, Kenny.
SUPMALE:What's a nice boy like you doing with ulcers anyway? You got a job and a girl who'll do anything for you.
LEADMALE:Anything.
SUPMALE:You will, won't you, Dorothy? I'll take that as a "Have a good time.
SUPFEMALE:" Don't worry, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Petrillo.
SUPFEMALE:I'll have your little girl home at a reasonable hour.
LEADFEMALE:Don't bother.
SUPFEMALE:You kids have fun.
OTHERFEMALE:I won't wait up.
OTHERMALE:Have her back by Tuesday.
LEADMALE:No questions asked.
SUPFEMALE:She's gonna blow it.
LEADMALE:OK, Paul, we'll see you at the rally on pier five.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, the dolphin will really appreciate it.
LEADMALE:Oh, isn't this exciting? Taking part in a protest.
LEADMALE:Standing up as free Americans and exercising our right to 
SUPFEMALE:"We're mad as hell and we're not gonna take it anymore!" I'm out of spit.
LEADFEMALE:Can I go now? and you're ready to quit? Blanche, we joined the Friends of Sea Mammals for a reason.
OTHERFEMALE:You are so unmotivated.
SUPFEMALE:Well, when I joined this Mammals with Blowholes thing, I didn't expect to be carrying picket signs on some grungy dock.
LEADMALE:I was hoping more for a fundraiser cocktail party with Chinese lanterns and Portuguese, no, Hispanic waiters in tight black pants.
SUPMALE:And we hire a band to play fish songs in pirate suits with muscles bulging.
SUPFEMALE:Your mouth is watering now, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Keep licking.
LEADMALE:Hi, girls.
LEADMALE:You two are back early.
SUPMALE:Of course we're back early.
OTHERFEMALE:Ken called before.
OTHERFEMALE:He says he needs to talk to Dorothy about something very important.
LEADMALE:Dorothy! My God, Dorothy, he's gonna pop the question.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I don't know that.
LEADMALE:Of course you do.
SUPMALE:What else could it be? Honey, congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:You're more excited than I am.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why not, Dorothy? Just think of it.
LEADFEMALE:Life with a successful attorney.
LEADMALE:The summer homes, the glamorous social circles, those impulsive little trips to Europe with rascally Romans pinching your bottom.
SUPFEMALE:You're a lucky girl, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:I hate you.
LEADFEMALE:This is just crazy talk.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we've only been seeing each other for three months.
LEADMALE:I've never even thought of what it would be like if I were Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Kenneth Whittingham.
LEADMALE:Has a nice ring to it.
LEADFEMALE:Go get 'em, pussycat.
SUPMALE:Just remember, you and I come as a package.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma! Hi.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart, I am so excited.
LEADMALE:Oh? It's just that I've come to a major decision.
LEADFEMALE:Oh? And it's a decision that affects both of us.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh? Sit down.
SUPFEMALE:Close your eyes and I'll give you a hint.
LEADMALE:Okey-dokey.
SUPMALE:Well? Can you guess what my decision is? You're becoming Irish? No.
SUPMALE:I'm becoming a clown.
LEADMALE:A full-time circus clown.
OTHERFEMALE:Ken, isn't this a bit sudden? Odd and a bit sudden? No.
LEADMALE:I've been doing it for years at children's hospitals.
LEADFEMALE:It's been the one bright spot in my life.
LEADFEMALE:That and you.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, I've been lawyering Can change a man.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but you're so successful.
SUPMALE:I'm also 60 and I'm miserable.
LEADMALE:Ah, I went to law school so I could fight for the little guy.
LEADFEMALE:Now I'm fighting for multinational corporations.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so frazzled, I find myself sneaking into the washroom to make balloon giraffes.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I really need for you to understand this.
LEADFEMALE:I've been thinking a lot lately.
LEADFEMALE:I think we're in this for the long haul.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I think this is going to be a very serious relationship.
LEADFEMALE:I feel like a virgin.
SUPMALE:Where do the noses go? I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:What do you say? You with me? Of course.
OTHERMALE:Oh, great.
SUPMALE:How about a celebration? I'm dining with friends from the circus.
OTHERMALE:Join me? Might as well get my feet wet.
SUPMALE:Oh, Ken.
OTHERMALE:There won't be, like, a dozen tiny dogs, hopping on hind legs, wearing funny hats? Oh, I wish.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, tell me.
LEADMALE:How big a disaster was last night? It wasn't a disaster, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:It was just uncomfortable.
LEADMALE:I tried to find common ground, something I could talk to Ken's circus friends about.
LEADFEMALE:But it turns out the Human Cannonball doesn't do that much reading.
LEADFEMALE:Does Ken know how you feel? He asked me how I felt, if I had a good time, and I had to tell him the truth.
LEADFEMALE:I just didn't fit in with the other clowns' wives.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I've been thinking.
LEADMALE:It might help you get your mind off this Ken thing for a while.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you join us at the rally? Oh, no-- Oh, yeah, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, do.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, get out of yourself.
SUPFEMALE:It's for a noble cause.
OTHERFEMALE:Or are you so self-centered that you'd rather wallow in self-pity? You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll do it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, Dorothy's taking my place.
SUPMALE:There you are, pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:What's this news about Ken? He gave you a ring, didn't he? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Three of them.
OTHERMALE:Look, Ma, I don't know how to say this, so I'll just give it to you straight out.
SUPMALE:Ken is becoming a clown.
LEADFEMALE:Scusi? Ma, he's tired of being a lawyer, so he's joining the circus.
LEADFEMALE:What did you do to him? I didn't do anything.
LEADMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:One day the man's a lawyer, the next he's a clown.
LEADFEMALE:Perfectly natural.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, please! This is hard enough as it is.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:I just tend to get a little upset when people ruin my life! Sophia, I don't know what all the hullabaloo is about.
SUPMALE:Dating a circus clown would be a dream come true for me.
LEADFEMALE:Reach for the stars, Rose.
SUPMALE:No, it would.
LEADMALE:Think about it.
LEADFEMALE:Seeing him push those little pigs around in a baby carriage.
LEADFEMALE:Getting hit with a bucket of confetti any time you want.
SUPMALE:And sitting up there in the stands, watching him sweep that spotlight into a little circle and thinking, "That's my man!" It's getting hot in here.
SUPMALE:Why did this happen? Just when I meet someone that I feel I have a future with, Ken does this.
OTHERFEMALE:I know I should be more supportive, but the fact is, I'm embarrassed.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be ridiculous, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:You love the man for who he is.
LEADFEMALE:It's not like he's driving you around in a tiny car with a giant key on the back.
LEADFEMALE:Is he?  Hi, sweetheart.
OTHERFEMALE:You are driving the Lincoln tonight? Sure.
SUPMALE:Oh, two things.
LEADFEMALE:We're doubling with Phil and Nancy tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Two things you have to 
LEADMALE:Call them "little people.
LEADFEMALE:" And they hate to be patted on the head.
LEADFEMALE:I found out the hard way.
LEADFEMALE:Kenny.
LEADMALE:Come here.
LEADMALE:What's with this clown business? Couldn't you be a lawyer and just hang out with clowns? I know it sounds a little odd, Mrs.
SUPMALE:Petrillo, but right now I'm just burned out on law.
LEADFEMALE:Frankly, I think I can contribute more to the world in big red shoes and a spinning bow tie and carrying a little umbrella that rains on me.
LEADFEMALE:I see.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy? Here.
LEADFEMALE:What did you do to him? We may not agree with the fishermen, but we want this demonstration to be peaceful.
SUPMALE:In the tradition of you know, the short, bald Indian fellow with the glasses and the diaper.
LEADFEMALE:You know, the one who didn't eat and won an Oscar.
SUPMALE:Your sign's drooping again.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, what's the matter? It's Ken.
SUPMALE:I don't know which end is up.
SUPFEMALE:He called me this morning.
LEADFEMALE:He wants me to travel with the circus.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid we're gonna have to call it quits.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, I'd think twice before I cut that guy off.
SUPFEMALE:At your age, how many chances at the brass ring do you have left? All creatures must learn to coexist.
LEADMALE:Back where I come from, they do.
OTHERMALE:That's why the brown bear and the field mouse can share their lives and live in harmony.
OTHERMALE:'Course, they can't mate, or the mice would explode.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know what I mean.
LEADFEMALE:I think Rose needs to work on her metaphors.
LEADMALE:I know you're down in the dumps, but I'm so glad you came.
LEADMALE:I really want us to make a difference today.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I am impressed.
SUPFEMALE:You have really changed your tune.
LEADMALE:It's funny how that happened.
LEADMALE:There I was, staying up last night, coming up with excuses to get out of this.
SUPMALE:And then it occurred to me.
LEADMALE:I said, "Water Lily" That's what I call myself sometimes.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:"Water Lily, you've never done anything like this in your life.
LEADFEMALE:Now, this is important.
SUPMALE:"For the love of mother earth and the love of mother nature, commit yourself to this, Blanche Devereaux!" Isn't that exciting? Caught a rerun of Flipper on cable, did you? A particularly touching one.
LEADMALE:Where Flipper comes to the rescue.
LEADFEMALE:It was only after that I picked up Rose's pamphlets and read about these magnificent creatures.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that's beautiful.
SUPFEMALE:Water Lily? Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:All right, you dolphin people, get away from the gate.
SUPMALE:Watch it.
OTHERMALE:What are you Why can't you people see the light? Why can't you people see that there's another point of view? Get away from here.
OTHERFEMALE:Take your hands off me! Let her go! Sweetheart, I came as soon as I could.
LEADMALE:Things got out of hand down at the dock.
SUPMALE:I'm fine.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:I called Ken.
LEADMALE:He's parking the car.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Did you hear that? Did you hear that? Ken is going to save us.
LEADMALE:Everybody, did you hear that? We'll be out of here in no time.
LEADMALE:My mother called my boyfriend, a top Miami lawyer.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing to worry about.
SUPMALE:We are in good hands.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Dorothy, sweetheart, there you are.
LEADFEMALE:My God! Ma, you didn't tell me he was in a clown suit! Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Ken, how could you? Sophia called me at rehearsal.
LEADMALE:I'll change.
SUPMALE:I just wanted to make sure you were all right.
SUPFEMALE:Is counsel for the demonstrators present? Here, Your Honor.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, God.
LEADFEMALE:Will the clown approach the bench? Dorothy, I can do this.
LEADFEMALE:Can you do it without the nose? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell are you trying to do? I know this looks odd.
LEADMALE:But I am a registered member of the bar.
LEADFEMALE:I have a card here to prove it.
LEADMALE:We're going to jail.
LEADMALE:I believe you, counselor, I believe you.
SUPMALE:Just proceed.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Your Honor.
LEADFEMALE:Make it quick.
SUPMALE:Your Honor, this may be my very last appearance before the bar.
SUPMALE:Would you indulge me just a little? Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I have been practicing law for many, many years, and it's always amazed me how little my job actually had to do with justice.
LEADMALE:This stuff sounds a little better when you've got lapels and a vest.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, my clients are charged with trespass.
LEADFEMALE:But the only real crime they committed was their overzealous championing of the defenseless dolphin.
SUPMALE:The dolphin, Your Honor, that for centuries has rescued men lost at sea, guided ships back to port.
LEADFEMALE:No, my clients were not trespassing.
SUPMALE:My clients were returning the favor.
LEADFEMALE:They simply wanted to protect some of nature's best creations from extinction.
SUPMALE:Your Honor you have the opportunity today to make a very disillusioned lawyer happy.
LEADMALE:Please answer to a law higher than this state's, and dispense some real justice here.
SUPFEMALE:Please, let's have a little quiet here.
LEADFEMALE:That was a great speech.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Your Honor.
SUPFEMALE:But help me out here.
LEADMALE:How about something from a law book? OK.
OTHERFEMALE:The fracas occurred on a seaside dock abutting navigable waters.
LEADMALE:I don't believe that this court has any jurisdiction.
LEADMALE:That sounds legal to me.
LEADFEMALE:Counselor, your last day has been a good one.
LEADMALE:Case dismissed.
LEADFEMALE:I want you two jailbirds to feel at home.
SUPFEMALE:Dinner's at six.
LEADFEMALE:Pass it on.
LEADMALE:Rose, honey, what is the matter? We didn't accomplish anything today, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Those tuna fishermen will be out there again tomorrow doing the same thing.
OTHERFEMALE:I swear, I feel like a failure.
LEADFEMALE:You can't change the world in one day.
LEADFEMALE:But just think about what we did do.
LEADMALE:I bet we saved a few dolphin by keeping that boat off the water, and the next time you're walking along the beach and you see a school swim by, why, you can think, "Maybe I saved those gorgeous creatures from those horrible nets.
LEADMALE:" You still think we were a failure? You're right.
LEADMALE:I just wish we could save 'em all.
LEADMALE:You wanna do more? Fine.
LEADMALE:Let's go back down to the dock.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:I know a waterfront bar where a lot of foreign fishermen hang out.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you think they'd listen to me? Well, sure, they will, honey.
SUPFEMALE:They don't speak English and they're horny.
LEADMALE:Where are you going? To demonstrate.
LEADMALE:To celebrate.
LEADFEMALE:So, anything special you want to do tonight? Ken There is something.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, you know you have the most beautiful eyes? And a quarter in your ear.
SUPFEMALE:We really have to talk.
SUPMALE:What's the matter? I don't know whether this is harder to say or harder to hear.
OTHERMALE:Ken, you're a lovable man, with a lot of lovable qualities, but I don't love you.
SUPFEMALE:It's this clown thing, isn't it? I thought that's what was bothering me.
LEADMALE:But, Ken, if I loved you, I'd follow you anywhere.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I see.
SUPFEMALE:I think we were both trying too hard to make this work.
LEADMALE:You on your terms, me on mine.
OTHERFEMALE:But I know that I am not prepared to give up my life.
LEADMALE:And, Ken, could you give up the circus for me? Could you give up the laughter? The smiles on those children's faces? Do you know something, Dorothy? I don't think I could.
SUPFEMALE:Could I give up the fat lady for you? No.
OTHERMALE:Could I give up the elephants for you? No.
SUPMALE:The chimps? The sword-swallower-- Ken.
LEADMALE:I think I have a grip on this.
LEADMALE:I guess at our age, we do a lot of wishful thinking.
SUPMALE:We did come close, though.
SUPMALE:If the circus is ever in town, I'll leave the tent flap open for you.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna miss you.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Oh Blanche, what are you doing lining shelves on a Friday night? I'm workin' off all my excess sexual energy.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't we just hook you up to the toaster and make Pop-Tarts? Don't make fun, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:This is the fifth Friday night in a row I haven't had a date.
LEADMALE:Honey, you're just in a little slump.
LEADMALE:Is that what this is? I never been in one before.
SUPMALE:Well, it feels like hell.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, how do you go through this for years at a stretch? I have compassionate friends around me.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I guess eventually this was bound to happen.
LEADFEMALE:I can just feel my femininity slippi" through my fingers.
SUPFEMALE:And in the past there's always been a man there to catch it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh Blanche, you're being ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:You are as attractive and desirable as you always were.
LEADMALE:But a lot of men can be frightened by that.
SUPMALE:They don't know if they can handle that much woman.
SUPMALE:So every once in a while this'll happen.
SUPMALE:No, Blanche, it takes a strong, confident, sophisticated man to appreciate you.
SUPFEMALE:But, honey, they're out there wanting you as much as you want them.
OTHERFEMALE:I knew it had to be something like that.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:There really is one born every minute.
LEADFEMALE:Ha ha.
SUPMALE:Thanks for seeing us home, Miles.
LEADMALE:It's my pleasure, Rose.
LEADMALE:Well, hello, there.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I didn't know you had company.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, Blanche, I'd like you to meet Miles Webber.
LEADFEMALE:How do you do, Miles? Nice to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:A real delight.
SUPMALE:Miles is my dancing partner at the ballroom.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes, and tonight we were the king and queen of the rumba.
LEADMALE:OlÃ©.
LEADMALE:Ma, did you have a good time? Great.
LEADFEMALE:I even made a few bucks.
SUPFEMALE:How did you do that, Sophia? The place was packed with old geezers ripe for the picking.
SUPFEMALE:I charged them Ma, you didn't! Please.
LEADFEMALE:I worked hard for that money.
SUPMALE:Half the time they'd fall asleep in the middle of a song.
OTHERFEMALE:How would you like to hold Mr.
LEADMALE:Morelli up for two choruses of "Jeepers Creepers"? Ma, you did all that for 10 cents? I know.
LEADMALE:It's worth a buck.
LEADMALE:But all these guys lived through the Depression.
LEADFEMALE:For a buck they expect a good time, a shoe shine and a full tank of gas.
SUPMALE:Listen, Rose, I'm having a little get-together over at my place tomorrow night.
LEADFEMALE:Someone I work with is retiring, and I was hoping you'd come.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I'd love it.
LEADFEMALE:Around 8:00, then? Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good.
LEADMALE:Well, good night, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:Nice meeting you.
OTHERMALE:Come back and see us some time.
LEADMALE:Good night, Rose.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:As they say in St.
SUPMALE:Olaf, helderbargenberg gefloefen wurterberg.
LEADMALE:You wanna help us out here, Rose? Well, there's really no English word for gefloefen.
SUPFEMALE:Loosely translated, it means, "I hope you have a license to carry that gefloefen.
SUPFEMALE:" And, uh, this is a quality that you look for in a man? Yes.
SUPMALE:Oh, maybe I'm crazy to be so attracted by someone I hardly know, but I can't help it.
LEADFEMALE:I've been dying for him to ask me out, but we never really talk, we just dance.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what do you know about him? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Except he's a wonderful dancer.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, what's that? All that proves is he has rhythm.
LEADMALE:I see what you mean.
LEADMALE:You know, you can learn a lot about a man just by the way he holds you in his arms.
LEADMALE:Whether he's kind, sensitive, caring He dipped you, didn't he? All evening.
LEADMALE:Oh, Lord.
OTHERFEMALE:So long since I've been dipped.
LEADMALE:I can't even remember which end of a gefloefen is up.
SUPMALE:Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Well, come on in.
LEADMALE:You're missing all the fun.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet you probably thought that a party full of college professors would be stuffy, but not this one.
SUPFEMALE:You're a college professor? Well, what did you think I meant when I said I taught Hemingway? I thought you were old.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:I want you to meet some people, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Gale, Lillian, this is my friend Rose.
LEADMALE:How do you do? Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Miles, we were just hypothesizing.
SUPFEMALE:If you were to invite any two people, living or dead, to dinner, who would they be? Well, Lillian picked Winston Churchill and Browning without his wife.
LEADMALE: Rose, whom would you pick? Just two? Well, that's tough.
SUPMALE:I Well, I'd feel guilty if I didn't invite my two best friends, Dorothy and Blanche, but would it be OK if Jesus stopped by for dessert?  Didn't I tell you she was something special? Rose, why don't I get you something to drink? What would you like? Ginger ale if you have it.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, but first I want to introduce you to two of my closest friends.
OTHERMALE:Harv, Elise, this is my friend Rose.
SUPMALE:Take good care of her.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:We were just having a little disagreement.
LEADMALE:Now, Harv, Moby Dick is about self-fulfilling prophesy.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Elise.
SUPFEMALE:The whale represents coming to terms with the self-hatred that's in all of us.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think? Uh I-I was just having a conversation with two people over there speculating on if you could have any two people in the world, living or dead, to your house for dinner, what would you eat? Blanche, I didn't know you went out.
LEADFEMALE:Are you coming back from a date? You know, Dorothy, sometimes you can be so cruel.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, If you didn't have a date, how come you're so dressed up? Well, I sat down and tried to think of a surefire place to meet men.
LEADMALE:It was so obvious I couldn't believe I hadn't thought of it before.
LEADMALE:The hardware store.
LEADMALE:I mean, hardware stores are alive with sexual energy.
OTHERFEMALE:Tools, plugs, sockets, nude furniture, dirty stuff like that.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you home so early? Well, I saw a very attractive man in power tools.
LEADMALE:I piqued his interest with the usual hardware questions.
LEADFEMALE:"Where does this go?" "What does this do?" And he followed me to plumbing, where I bought a see-through shower curtain.
OTHERMALE:And, uh, where is he now? Tied to the roof rack of your car? No, there was something about him that turned me off.
LEADMALE:I think it was the way he cleaned his ears with his keys.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:You're home early.
LEADFEMALE:Did you enjoy yourself? Not really.
LEADFEMALE:Miles' friends are all college professors.
LEADFEMALE:I don't get it.
LEADFEMALE:When we're on the dance floor, it feels like we're made for each other.
LEADFEMALE:But tonight, with all his brilliant friends at the party, I felt like a fish out of water.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sure I didn't flop around on the floor with my eyes bulging out gasping for air.
OTHERFEMALE:I haven't done that at a party in years.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you know, anybody would feel out of her league in a room full of college professors.
OTHERMALE:You should have a home field advantage.
LEADMALE:Why don't you invite him over here? Dorothy's right.
LEADFEMALE:We can create the illusion that you're interestin'.
OTHERFEMALE:That's a hell of an illusion.
SUPMALE:Maybe we should just saw her in half.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get the coffee.
OTHERMALE:Dinner was delicious, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:What was it? It's a Scandinavian specialty
LEADMALE:kuldomar.
SUPMALE:I've never heard of that before, but it's marvelous.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you just throw together some ground pork and cabbage.
LEADMALE:Cabbage, she serves me.
LEADFEMALE:In ten minutes I could be sky-writing.
OTHERMALE:You girls were right about getting Miles on my turf.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, and I'm really grateful for you steering the table talk to things I know about.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you ought to be.
SUPMALE:It wasn't that easy working natural fertilizer into the dinner conversation.
LEADMALE:What are you planning next? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think it's too soon to put on the bloopers tape? Just a tad.
SUPFEMALE:So the existentialist says to the psychiatrist, "Just because you don't see a parrot on my head"  Eh? You see?  Ooh, listen.
SUPMALE:Rose, I was wondering.
LEADMALE:If you're not busy Saturday afternoon, the university is playing Shostakovich.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'd love to go.
OTHERFEMALE:And I'll bet we beat 'em.
LEADMALE:Rose, honey, it's not a team.
LEADMALE:It's a composer.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I better get the dessert.
SUPMALE:She sure left in a hurry.
LEADMALE:Hey, who told her to feed me cabbage? I thought I'd give you a hand with the dessert.
LEADMALE:What's wrong, Rose? "It's not a team, Rose.
LEADMALE:It's a composer.
LEADFEMALE:" Couldn't you pretend it was a team and make him look stupid? Honey, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going back out there.
LEADMALE:He'll never miss me.
OTHERMALE:Of course he'll miss you.
LEADMALE:Rose, you're the one he came to see.
LEADFEMALE:But he can talk to you.
LEADMALE:Why should he care about what I'd have to say? I'm just not smart enough to keep up.
SUPMALE:Oh, now, Rose, that is not true.
OTHERMALE:It is and you know it.
SUPMALE:I've never felt like this before.
LEADMALE:I was one of the smartest people in St.
SUPMALE:Olaf.
SUPMALE:I was a fool to think we could have a relationship.
SUPFEMALE:Please apologize to him for me.
SUPMALE:I'd do it, but it would just sound stupid.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:I will tell her.
SUPFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi, Rose.
LEADMALE:Rose, Miles called again.
LEADMALE:He wants you to meet him outside the concert hall.
SUPFEMALE:I asked you to tell him I'm not going.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not gonna do your dirty work for you, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't wanna talk to him.
LEADMALE:He makes me feel foolish.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even feel comfortable telling him St.
SUPFEMALE:Olaf stories.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna know exactly what he's said to make you feel that way.
SUPMALE:Look, I'm not going out with him.
LEADMALE:You go, Blanche.
LEADMALE:What? Well, you like him.
OTHERMALE:I know you do.
LEADFEMALE:So you go.
LEADMALE:Why, I couldn't.
LEADMALE:Of course she couldn't.
OTHERMALE:You stay outta this, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Well, why not? It's all over between us.
LEADMALE:He'll know that tonight.
OTHERMALE:It's impossible.
SUPMALE:I'd
OTHERMALE:I'd feel like a I'd feel like a A backstabbing slut? No.
SUPMALE:Then please go, for me.
LEADMALE:I'll feel better knowing this thing is finally over with.
LEADFEMALE:Well, since you put it that way But only as a personal favor to you, honey.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess I'd better go get dressed.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Can you believe that backstabbing slut? Oh, Ma, you going to the ballroom again? No.
LEADFEMALE:I was thinking of wearing this when I die.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think? Come on, Rose, why aren't you ready? I'm not going.
LEADFEMALE:How come? Miles might be there, and I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, now, Rose, don't say you're going to feel stupid.
OTHERMALE:You are not stupid.
SUPMALE:You just march to a different drummer.
SUPMALE:Yeah, the little windup monkey banging on the snare drum.
SUPFEMALE:Ma I was agreeing.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, how was the concert? It is amazing how music that loud can be so boring.
LEADFEMALE:And Miles? Oh, even more boring than the music.
OTHERFEMALE:All he did all night was talk about you.
SUPMALE:How sweet Rose is.
OTHERFEMALE:How attractive Rose is.
LEADFEMALE:How much fun Rose is.
LEADMALE:I might as well have worn a bra.
OTHERMALE:Did he really say that? You're not just making that up? I never make up stories where I come out lookin' bad.
SUPFEMALE:He also said he's going to the ballroom tonight, and he hopes you'll be there.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I couldn't.
SUPMALE:Oh, I mean, I want to, but I can't.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? What if Miles and I are dancing and I say something idiotic? Just breathe it in his ear.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing sounds idiotic if it's wet enough.
SUPFEMALE:Will you come with me for moral support? Oh, not tonight, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna get to bed early, curl up with a good book.
LEADFEMALE:That's all you ever do.
LEADMALE:No, it isn't.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, it is, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:That's all you've done lately, and it's pathetic.
SUPMALE:What's even more pathetic is that I've been home to watch.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, I really need you there.
LEADFEMALE:I need your shoulder in case he takes his away.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, all right, I'll go.
SUPMALE:Ma, where are my dancing shoes? In the Smithsonian, right next to Fred Astaire's.
SUPFEMALE:How the hell would I know? Blanche, you coming with us? Oh, you're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Of course.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you'll love it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh! Nothing personal, honey, but those places are meant for desperate, hopeless people who can't find someone any other way.
SUPMALE:Well, if you're sure.
SUPMALE:I'd rather be tied to a tree covered in honey and have a family of grizzlies lick it off.
LEADFEMALE:Why do I torture myself like this? Girls, wait for me!  Ma, this-this place is fantastic.
SUPFEMALE:I feel like I did when I was 20.
OTHERFEMALE:You mean unmarried and pregnant? Blanche, look around.
LEADMALE:Isn't this wonderful? Aren't you suddenly the life of the party? This place gives me the creeps.
OTHERMALE:But look, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:See how much fun everybody's having? Yeah, right now, but wait till they hear Glenn Miller's dead.
SUPMALE:He's not dead.
SUPFEMALE:He's missing! Stop complaining, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Look at all the available men here.
SUPMALE:You shouldn't have any problem.
SUPMALE:Are you kiddin'? This is gonna be just like fishin' in one of those trout farms.
LEADMALE:May I have this dance, Sophia? I got the time if you got the dime.
LEADMALE:I'm all yours.
LEADMALE:I don't see Miles here anywhere.
SUPMALE:Maybe he didn't come tonight.
SUPMALE:He almost didn't.
LEADMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Miles.
SUPMALE:You left my party as soon as you arrived.
SUPFEMALE:You invite me to dinner, you disappear into the house.
SUPMALE:You send Blanche to the concert.
SUPMALE:I was beginning to take it personally.
LEADFEMALE:Shall we? Go on, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I am going to keep one arm around your waist to make sure you don't disappear again.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, this is Alfred.
OTHERMALE:He's an ear, nose and throat specialist.
SUPMALE:He says he's been lookin' for love in all the wrong places.
LEADMALE:I was happy to see you here tonight, Rose.
LEADMALE:I was starting to wonder how you felt about me.
LEADMALE:Rose, is there something wrong? You've hardly said a word.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:I'm glad to hear it.
SUPMALE:Would you care to dance? Oh, I I don't think so.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I'm usually not this forward, but Glenn Miller has such an effect on me.
SUPMALE:You don't like Glenn Miller, do you? Are you kidding? I was in the search party.
LEADFEMALE:Let's dance.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, listen to that music.
SUPMALE:Who says you can't go home again? Canute Trollsted.
SUPFEMALE:You see, he took Ilse Frickerdeller up to Smooch Point to play hide the fingerborg.
LEADMALE:That's a thimble.
LEADMALE:Well, Ilse sat on his compass, and they got so lost they walked to Finland, and that's when Canute said, "You can't go home again.
LEADFEMALE:" Well, that's very, uh Stupid! Rose.
LEADMALE:Rose.
LEADMALE:Is something wrong? I don't know what you see in me, Miles.
SUPMALE:I see you.
LEADFEMALE:But why me? I thought you'd like Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I like Blanche very much.
SUPFEMALE:So does Blanche.
LEADMALE:Ha ha ha.
LEADMALE:That's better.
SUPFEMALE:I feel so dumb around you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, never say that, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:But you're a teacher.
LEADMALE:You you think for a living.
SUPMALE:Well, don't be so impressed.
LEADMALE:I have summers off.
LEADFEMALE:How you can stand listening to me and all my ridiculous stories Your stories are very refreshing, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:It's like driving in the country and getting lost.
LEADMALE:You may not know where you are, but you always have a good time finding your way out.
LEADFEMALE:That was a compliment, wasn't it? Come on.
SUPFEMALE:I like you very much, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you're you're very special.
LEADMALE:I'm just lucky to be smart enough to see it.
LEADMALE:You know, life's a ballroom, Rose, if you'll pardon the metaphor.
LEADFEMALE:If you hear something you like, don't analyze it, just just dance to it.
SUPFEMALE:You understand? I think so.
SUPFEMALE:Except what a metaphor is.
LEADMALE:Who needs metaphors? Come on.
LEADMALE:Let's dance.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Rose, what are you doing? I'm diapering a turkey.
LEADFEMALE:It's been so long since I changed a diaper, I figured I'd practice before the baby gets here.
OTHERMALE:Ma! Hello, Martha.
SUPFEMALE:Where were you? I'll give you a hint.
LEADFEMALE:The guest of honor had lipstick on her teeth and didn't give a damn.
LEADFEMALE:Who died? My best friend, Lydia.
SUPMALE:I'm so sorry.
LEADMALE:She suffered so.
LEADMALE:It was a blessing in disguise.
LEADFEMALE:I always wondered why blessings wore disguises.
LEADFEMALE:If I were a blessing, I'd run around naked.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that must be the baby.
LEADMALE:There's a baby coming? A couple from my church are going camping over the weekend, and we get to take care of the baby.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe now you'll get some food I can chew.
LEADMALE:How about a cup of tea, Martha? A little.
LEADMALE:I made a pig of myself at the funeral.
OTHERMALE:It was nice.
OTHERFEMALE:Everybody had a good time.
LEADMALE:I'm going to miss her so much.
SUPMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:But you said yourself, the last few weeks were so hard on her.
LEADFEMALE:At least now she's resting peacefully.
LEADMALE:I feel so bad.
LEADMALE:Hey, I'm the one who should feel bad.
LEADMALE:Lydia and I were wearing the same dress.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, can we go now? I've been planning this for months
SUPFEMALE:a weekend alone in the woods.
LEADMALE:It's going to be perfect.
LEADFEMALE:It sounds romantic.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you'll have another baby.
LEADFEMALE:I'd better make sure we packed everything.
OTHERMALE:Well, thanks again.
SUPFEMALE:Goodbye, Francis.
LEADFEMALE:You be good now.
LEADFEMALE:Now, don't you worry about a thing.
OTHERFEMALE:What a beautiful little thing.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:What is it, Rose? A boy or a girl? Of course! I mean, is it Frances as in Francie, or Francis as in Frank? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:It's wearing yellow.
SUPFEMALE:We could find out, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:How? Put on the Dolphins game and see if it watches.
OTHERFEMALE:By looking, Rose! We could change its diaper, and see if it has a winky.
LEADFEMALE:A "winky"? That's the scientific term for it, when it's little.
SUPMALE:But the baby isn't wet.
SUPFEMALE:We'll change it anyway.
LEADMALE:Here you go.
LEADMALE:Here I go? The best time to change a diaper is when there's nothing in it.
OTHERMALE:I'll do it.
SUPMALE:You can help me.
LEADMALE:OK.
SUPMALE:Ready? One, two, three  Frank.
SUPMALE:May I help you, madame? How d'you know I'm not a mademoiselle? Because what man in his right mind would leave you to languish on the vine? If this was Sicily, you wouldn't have any lips left.
SUPFEMALE:Take me to my friend Martha Lamont's table, and try not to fall in love.
LEADFEMALE:Miss Lamont is waiting for you at the bar.
LEADMALE:Oh, good.
OTHERMALE:With luck, she found somebody who'll pay for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Martha! You look terrific.
LEADFEMALE:Are those new knee-highs? It's a new attitude
LEADMALE:eat, drink and be merry.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Jacques.
LEADMALE:Gimme a hand, and watch where you put it.
LEADFEMALE:That was better than I thought it would be.
SUPMALE:Now I can't wait to get down.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Can I get you ladies drinks? I'll have a Manhattan.
SUPFEMALE:And don't slip me any of the cheap stuff.
LEADMALE:I'll have another Harvey Wallbanger.
LEADMALE:You've seen quite a bit of Mr.
SUPMALE:Wallbanger tonight.
SUPMALE:I'm celebrating, because I've just had an idea that will change my life.
SUPFEMALE:Order anything you like.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to have the shrimp cocktail, the cream of mushroom soup, asparagus with hollandaise sauce, and the filet mignon.
OTHERFEMALE:I like cholesterol as much as the next guy, but you're never gonna get blood to your feet again.
SUPFEMALE:I'd like to drink a toast.
SUPMALE:To Sophia, whom I hope I can count on.
SUPMALE:For what? Get your lips off Harvey and tell me what you want! Since you mentioned it, I want you to do something for me.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to come over to my place tomorrow night.
LEADMALE:What, is it your birthday? Sophia, there aren't going to be any more birthdays.
LEADFEMALE:What are you telling me? I have so many things wrong with me
SUPFEMALE:arthritis, high blood pressure, angina, just to mention a few.
OTHERFEMALE:Who doesn't? You can't get into a canasta game unless you have at least two debilitating diseases.
OTHERFEMALE:Your table is ready, mesdames.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, for me it was better the first time.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think? Right this way, please.
LEADMALE:So why do you want me to be at your house tomorrow? I want you to be there when I kill myself.
LEADMALE:What is it, Blanche? I can't quite make it out.
LEADMALE:I think my eyes are tired.
SUPFEMALE:Your eyes are old.
SUPMALE:Blanche, when are you gonna admit you need glasses? I do not need glasses.
LEADFEMALE:My mother didn't need glasses till the day she died.
LEADFEMALE:And then it seemed silly.
LEADMALE:What is his temperature, Blanche? I do not know, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Even with perfect eyesight, nobody can read one of these things.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:It's 103.
LEADMALE:2! The poor baby! We'd better contact his parents.
SUPMALE:They're out in the woods somewh- We'd better call Harry.
SUPMALE:We're very lucky we have a pediatrician right down the street.
LEADMALE:No, that's a bad idea.
LEADMALE:Why? Because by the time I get my hair done and my face on, that baby could be in serious trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Let's call his real pediatrician.
SUPMALE:OK.
SUPFEMALE:Pediatrician.
SUPFEMALE:Pe Here it is.
OTHERMALE:Dr.
SUPMALE:Harry Weston.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, God! Oh, come on, Blanche, he's a doctor.
OTHERFEMALE:He's used to seeing people at their worst.
LEADFEMALE:And if you comb your hair, you can be right in that ball park.
LEADMALE:Harry? Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Listen, I'm so sorry I have to call you at home, but we're taking care of the Lillistrand baby, and he's running a very high fever.
LEADMALE:Could you come over right away? No, this is not Blanche playing a joke.
SUPMALE:Thanks, Harry.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks very much.
SUPFEMALE:He's coming? Right away.
LEADFEMALE:I'd better freshen up.
LEADMALE:Blanche, he is not coming over to look at you.
LEADFEMALE:He's coming over to look at the baby.
OTHERFEMALE:I will be holding the baby, next to my bosom.
LEADFEMALE:What a magnificent picture.
LEADMALE:God, I wish that thing didn't look so sickly.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care if you are paying for dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:What you wanna do is crazy.
SUPFEMALE:It's time to go, Sophia.
SUPMALE:I don't want to see another Monday.
LEADMALE:I don't want to wait, and end up going like Lydia.
SUPMALE:I'm going to decide when it's over.
LEADFEMALE:I always thought somebody named God did that.
LEADMALE:You don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid of the pain, of the hurting.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid of being alone, of dying alone.
OTHERFEMALE:I can take the pills myself, but I want you to be there and hold my hand.
LEADFEMALE:You're right, I don't understand.
OTHERMALE:I'd do anything to stay alive.
OTHERFEMALE:If my heart stopped beating, I'd want every doctor in town jumping up and down on my chest.
LEADMALE:You say that now, but I don't have the courage to die by inches.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to do it, whether you're there or not.
SUPMALE:I don't want to die alone.
SUPFEMALE:Please, help me.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, do you think this looks alluring and yet nurselike? I don't know, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe the earrings put it over the top.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, I did that for the baby
LEADFEMALE:they love shiny things.
LEADMALE:Listen, maybe you two oughtta wait in the kitchen with the kid.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Freeze! Don't go near that door.
SUPFEMALE:Gimme that thing.
LEADMALE:Hello, Frank, darling.
SUPMALE:How do I look? It's all wrong, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:The baby doesn't match your shoes.
LEADMALE:Hello, ladies!  Oh, Harry, thanks so much for coming over.
LEADMALE:Frank! Frank, talk to me.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on here? He isn't feeling very well, so we thought we'd have you over for a drink.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, why don't we just forget the baby and go dancing? Oh! Blanche, that is some outfit! What do you call that? A negligee.
LEADMALE:Brings back fond memories.
OTHERFEMALE:My mother used to have one just like it.
LEADMALE:Here, take him
SUPMALE:he's wet.
LEADFEMALE:Well, somebody better change him, or he'll get a rash on his winky.
LEADFEMALE:We're sorry we had to disturb you, Harry, but he's running a fever of 103.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think it is? He could be teething, it could be the flu.
SUPMALE:Maybe he's just a hypochondriac.
OTHERMALE:Really? Well, let's take a look.
LEADFEMALE:So, you've been keeping these ladies busy, have you? Oh, I didn't mind.
LEADFEMALE:I have such a highly developed maternal instinct.
LEADMALE:Uh, I was talking to the baby, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Any other symptoms? Rash or? No, he was fine one minute, and running a fever the next.
LEADMALE:Is it the usual? Huh? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Frank tends to get ear infections from time to time.
OTHERFEMALE:Is he gonna be all right? He'll be fine.
LEADFEMALE:We'll keep a close watch on him.
OTHERFEMALE:Give him four drops of this right now, and then once every two hours.
LEADFEMALE:Give him plenty of fluids so he doesn't get dehydrated.
OTHERFEMALE:And I'll check back on you tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:When are we supposed to sleep? Not that I mind.
LEADFEMALE:I was born to heal.
SUPMALE:Heel, Blanche! Welcome back to motherhood, ladies.
OTHERMALE:I'm sure you were good mothers and you remember what to do.
LEADMALE:Blanche, watch the others.
OTHERMALE:You look like you pick up things quickly.
LEADMALE:Gotta go.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:What is wrong with this baby? Honey, darling, please shut up for Aunt Blanche! You know, back in St.
SUPMALE:Olaf, we had a surefire method for getting babies to sleep.
OTHERFEMALE:If herring, elk, or anyone named Sven figures in this, I don't wanna hear it.
LEADMALE:OK, I've got another one.
SUPMALE:Whenever my kids couldn't sleep, we always sang to them.
OTHERFEMALE:A lullaby? Sort of.
LEADMALE:"Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Sandman.
SUPFEMALE:" Oh, I don't know, Rose Dorothy, come on.
SUPFEMALE:It's worth a try.
LEADFEMALE:It's either we sing or he sings.
LEADMALE:Oh, all right.
OTHERMALE:Boom Boom Well? Well what? After my "boom" comes your "boom," and then yours
SUPMALE:until we're all "boom"ing.
SUPFEMALE:How complicated is that herring thing? Boom Boom, boom, boom Boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom Mr.
LEADMALE:Sandman Bring me a dream Boom, boom, boom, boom Make him the cutest that I've ever seen Boom, boom, boom, boom Give him two lips like roses and clover Boom, boom, boom, boom Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over    Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Sandman  Yes? Bring me a dream Make him the cutest that I've ever seen Give him the word that I'm not a rover Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over Mr.
OTHERMALE:Sandman I'm so alone Boy, you guys really stink.
LEADFEMALE:We were just singing the baby to sleep.
SUPFEMALE:It was waking me up.
LEADMALE:Maybe we ought to go out in the kitchen.
SUPMALE:So we can talk.
LEADFEMALE:So we can eat.
LEADFEMALE:Better.
OTHERMALE:Ma, we're sorry our singing woke you.
OTHERFEMALE:It wasn't you.
LEADFEMALE:I had a horrible nightmare.
LEADMALE:I dreamt my Uncle Giuseppe came down from heaven and was pointing a finger at me.
LEADFEMALE:I think it was a finger.
LEADFEMALE:And he was warning me
SUPFEMALE:if I did a certain thing, I wouldn't get into heaven.
LEADMALE:What thing? Try murder.
OTHERFEMALE:It was just a dream, Sophia.
SUPMALE:It's not just a dream for me.
LEADFEMALE:Martha wants to commit suicide, and she wants me to be there with her.
OTHERMALE:And what did you say? I said I'd think about it.
SUPMALE:You can't say no to somebody who pops for a $75 dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell them, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Ma, I can't believe that you're seriously considering getting involved in this! Martha's a sick woman.
LEADFEMALE:And she doesn't wanna get any sicker.
SUPFEMALE:She's gonna do it anyway, so why should she die alone? This is wrong, Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:Forget about whether this is right or wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, I'm worried about you! When Martha takes those pills or whatever and the life drains out of her, you're gonna be in that room, alone.
SUPFEMALE:What are you gonna do, Ma? How are you gonna feel? I don't know, but I'll deal with it.
LEADMALE:When my time comes, I sure want somebody to put me out of my misery if something tragic happens
SUPMALE:like I get a fatal illness, or I've lost my looks.
LEADFEMALE:Tell us when, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, I forbid you to do this.
LEADMALE:Sometimes you forget
LEADFEMALE:I'm the mother here.
LEADFEMALE:That has nothing to do with this.
LEADMALE:It has everything to do with this.
LEADMALE:In the 25 years I have on you, I've learned something.
LEADMALE:I just wish I could remember what it is.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, I got it.
OTHERMALE:It's not whether you agree or disagree with somebody.
OTHERFEMALE:It's whether you can be there for that person when they need you.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, I can't believe you're doing this.
LEADMALE:You know, this reminds me of the story of Gunilla Ulf's daughter, St.
OTHERFEMALE:Olaf's very own angel of death.
LEADMALE:Tell it, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Tell it.
SUPFEMALE:Really? All the way through? All the way through.
SUPMALE:But please try to make the end come as close to the beginning as possible.
LEADMALE:Well, Gunilla Ulf's daughter was a nurse at Cedars of St.
LEADMALE:Olaf Hospital.
LEADFEMALE:One night she was taking care of Sven Bjornsson, and he asked her if she would get him some more mouth moisteners and then kill him.
LEADFEMALE:Gunilla brought the mouth moisteners right away, but the killing thing seemed to go against everything she'd been taught.
LEADFEMALE:You're doing beautifully, Rose.
LEADMALE:He begged and he begged, and by her coffee break, she couldn't stand it anymore, so she pulled the plug and he died.
LEADMALE:Well, she was racked with guilt that night.
SUPFEMALE:Not only had she parked her car in a doctor's spot, but she was never sure whether Sven's pleading was the pain talking, or the medication talking, or the guy in the next bed talking! You see, the guy in the next bed was Ingmar von Bergen, St.
LEADMALE:Olaf's meanest ventriloquist.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, we are going somewhere with this, aren't we? I mean, if not, I'm gonna cut out your tongue.
LEADFEMALE:Yes! Sven came back to haunt Gunilla
SUPFEMALE:since then, every Tuesday night at ten.
OTHERFEMALE:Nine, Central time.
LEADMALE:Oh! She hears noises.
LEADFEMALE:Some say it's the wind, but some say it's Sven's voice whispering back from the other side, saying, "Turn around quick
LEADMALE:his lips are moving.
LEADMALE:" You see that, Ma? You kill someone, you end up being a Rose story.
OTHERFEMALE:Is this what you want? Dorothy, I'll worry about me later.
LEADMALE:I gotta do this.
LEADFEMALE:Goodnight, pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:You came.
SUPMALE:I said I would.
SUPMALE:Come in.
LEADFEMALE:Come in and sit down.
LEADFEMALE:I have something to show you.
LEADFEMALE:Look, ten carats, and not a flaw.
LEADMALE:I bought it today, on time.
SUPFEMALE:Very nice.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, I was thinking, maybe you shouldn't go through with this No, I have to go.
LEADFEMALE:I've never felt so happy.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you like the ring? Reminds me of a doorknob I had back in Brooklyn.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing? Just my way of saying thank you.
LEADMALE:Well, I think I've taken care of everything.
LEADMALE:Now, you'll see to it that they don't put lipstick on my teeth.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:I'll take them out and check them personally.
LEADFEMALE:Well I guess it's time to go.
LEADMALE:You will hold my hand? Sure I will.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm so glad I don't have to go alone.
LEADMALE:Uh d'you remember how we met? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:About eight years ago.
SUPFEMALE:We shared a room in the hospital.
LEADMALE:You had the heart scare, I was the gall bladder.
LEADFEMALE:They gave you my sponge bath by mistake.
LEADMALE:You ate my Jell-O.
LEADFEMALE:It was a horrible little room.
SUPMALE:We couldn't wait to get out of it.
LEADFEMALE:Because we wanted to live.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:I remember.
LEADFEMALE:Remember better.
SUPFEMALE:Remember life.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't have much of one.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not like you.
LEADMALE:You live with friends and family, holidays and warmth.
LEADFEMALE:I hear the silence.
OTHERMALE:We'll talk.
SUPMALE:We'll talk all the time.
SUPFEMALE:You can come over Thanksgiving, Christmas, every Friday night.
LEADMALE:I may not be there, but you could always talk to Rose.
LEADFEMALE:No, I want to go.
SUPMALE:Lydia looked so peaceful.
SUPMALE:We're not in this life for peace! You're crying! No, I'm not.
SUPFEMALE:I don't cry.
LEADMALE:I can see your tears.
SUPMALE:I can see yours.
SUPFEMALE:Know what that tells me? What? You're not as ready to die as you think you are.
LEADMALE:You still wanna live, kid.
LEADFEMALE:Some kid! I don't know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:That's the point.
LEADMALE:If you're not sure, you can't change your mind tomorrow.
OTHERMALE:You wanted me to be here for your death.
LEADMALE:How about letting me be here for your life? Like a friend? Like a best friend.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, honey, sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Pacing isn't gonna help.
OTHERFEMALE:I just can't stop thinking about Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Look at that! Perfect
SUPFEMALE:98.
OTHERFEMALE:6.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's what it looks like to me.
LEADMALE:Thank God! That means he's better.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:I'm pooped.
LEADMALE:I guess there must be a reason why women have babies when they're 20ish instead of 40ish.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, the only thing in this room that's 40ish is your hairdo.
SUPFEMALE:Ma.
SUPMALE:It's OK.
SUPFEMALE:She changed her mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Ma, Thank God! I know, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:That must be the Lillistrands.
LEADFEMALE:Frank, we love you, but you are out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Gimme a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, you.
OTHERMALE:You're just starting out.
LEADFEMALE:You're in for the long haul.
LEADFEMALE:Keep your seat belt on
SUPMALE:there are lots of twists and turns.
SUPMALE:Stop that, or they're gonna come in here and sing again! 
SUPFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:Mmm! Morning! Morning.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, taste this.
SUPFEMALE:Mmm! Oh, Ma, that's wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, smells fine to me.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know why they're recalling it.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning.
SUPFEMALE:Morning, Rose.
LEADMALE:Wait, there's something different about you.
LEADMALE:Didn't you used to have a neck? It's tension.
SUPMALE:It always goes to the same place.
LEADMALE:My shoulder's tight and my neck gets stiff and I can't turn my head.
LEADFEMALE:You mean you can't move your neck at all? No.
LEADFEMALE:Look out, behind you! Hey, you gotta make your own fun around here.
LEADMALE:Honey, what's making you so tense? It's my job, all the pressure.
SUPFEMALE:What's the big deal? You're just working for a consumer reporter
LEADFEMALE:you're not actually on TV yourself.
SUPMALE:Well, it is a big deal.
LEADFEMALE:All those consumers are depending on me to do a good job.
SUPFEMALE:If I'm not careful, people could get hurt or cheated.
LEADFEMALE:Look, it's Jimmy Smits! Ma, stop that.
SUPMALE:Rose, you're gonna have to learn how to take care of that stress.
LEADFEMALE:You can't walk around in agony.
LEADFEMALE:She's right.
SUPFEMALE:For a bad neck, you get into bed, lie perfectly still and wait until it's over.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:That's not a bad neck, that's bad sex.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Michael! Michael! I can't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey, it is so good to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody, Michael is here.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Rose, it's Michael.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not falling for that again.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Grandma, you look more beautiful than ever.
LEADMALE:Relax, you're already in the will.
LEADMALE:Now come give me a hug.
LEADMALE:Honey, Michael, I thought you were touring with that band.
LEADFEMALE:Great news, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:I quit.
LEADMALE:You quit? You just got the job two weeks ago.
LEADMALE:I know, but I feel like I'm in a rut.
SUPMALE:Michael, how are you gonna support your wife? More good news
SUPFEMALE:Lorraine and I separated.
LEADFEMALE:Sep-- What do you mean? He means he and Lorraine aren't living together.
LEADMALE:I know what he means.
SUPFEMALE:It's just a breather
SUPMALE:give each other space.
LEADMALE:She threw you out, didn't she? She changed the locks and everything.
SUPMALE:I mean, she even tossed all my clothes out the window.
LEADMALE:You can't imagine what it's like, searching for underwear in the back of a convertible.
LEADMALE:Tell me about it.
LEADMALE:Michael, couldn't you have tried to make it work before you just walked away? I tried
LEADFEMALE:God knows, I tried
LEADMALE:but Ma, she didn't understand who I am.
SUPFEMALE:She didn't understand I'm a free spirit.
SUPMALE:And that's why I like to come home
SUPFEMALE:'cause you understand me.
LEADMALE:It's not just because I do your laundry? Michael, we were just having breakfast.
SUPFEMALE:Would you join us? That's the best offer I've had all morning.
LEADMALE:You know, it wouldn't hurt if you backed your kid up more.
SUPMALE:Oh, Ma, it's just that I hate to see Michael making all the wrong choices.
SUPFEMALE:You know what I mean? How could I know? My children made all the right choices.
LEADMALE:My son was a cross-dresser, my daughter was unmarried and pregnant.
OTHERMALE:Hell, I was the Rose Kennedy of Brooklyn! Rose! Honey, it's three in the morning! Why are you staring at those light bulbs? I'm running a consumer test for work.
LEADFEMALE:I have to see which one of these lasts longer.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, you ninny, don't you know staring at light bulbs for hours is bad for your eyes? Hey, instead of worrying about my eyes, I'd be more concerned with those purple spots all over your face.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I'm frazzled.
SUPMALE:Not only is this due tomorrow, but I have to make sure this watch really is waterproof.
LEADMALE:Honey, why don't you take the watch off your wrist? Come on, Blanche! Then I'd have my hand in a bucket of water for nothing.
LEADMALE:Rose, listen.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want you to take this the wrong way but you are driving us crazy.
SUPMALE:Now, you've got to get some sleep.
LEADMALE:How? There is no way I can relax when I'm so anxious about these work deadlines.
OTHERMALE:Learn to relax.
OTHERFEMALE:I learned how to relax in any situation on that meditation retreat.
SUPFEMALE:You went on a meditation retreat? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Was it successful? Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:By the end of the week 17 men were using my name as a mantra.
LEADFEMALE:OK, how do you meditate? Well, just shut your eyes.
SUPFEMALE:Now breathe deeply.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Mm-hm.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hm.
SUPMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:I can't.
OTHERMALE:I'm too wound up.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche! Which one went out first? Beats me.
LEADMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Now what am I gonna tell Enrique Mas tomorrow? You are going to tell him that you are overworked.
LEADFEMALE:I can't tell him that.
LEADMALE:He'll think I can't do the job.
LEADFEMALE:You can't do it, Rose
SUPMALE:not like this.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you talk to him and tell him you have too much to do.
LEADMALE:If it means your job, it means your job.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you can't go on like this
LEADFEMALE:you'll die.
SUPFEMALE:Or we'll kill you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll think about it, Blanche.
SUPMALE:But I'm telling you, I'm not ready to give up the most challenging, exciting job I've ever had.
SUPMALE:Ma, Ma, listen to this.
LEADMALE:"Saxophone player wanted at the Hacienda Hut cocktail lounge.
OTHERFEMALE:" What do you think? I guess I could learn.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, not for you
SUPMALE:for Michael.
LEADMALE:For the past week all he's been doing is hanging out at the beach and having a good time.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe this job at the Hacienda Hut will get him on the right track again.
LEADFEMALE:You don't want Michael working in a place like the Hacienda Hut.
SUPFEMALE:It is full of people just looking for easy sex and cheap thrills.
LEADFEMALE:But if it'll help, I could write a letter of recommendation.
LEADFEMALE:Why push Michael into a job? Give him time to breathe.
OTHERFEMALE:Let him find himself.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Ma, I'm a little concerned.
LEADMALE:He just doesn't take commitment seriously.
LEADMALE:Ma, he quits jobs, he leaves relationships.
LEADFEMALE:It's like they don't matter.
LEADFEMALE:He is 30 years old.
SUPFEMALE:When's he gonna grow up? Why should he, when you make it so easy for him not to? Are you saying it's my fault? All I'm saying is, you have to do something, or you're gonna end up with a 60-year-old kid who can't hold a job or have a meaningful relationship, who keeps running to you all the time for emotional support.
LEADMALE:Can you imagine a man like that?  No, I can't.
LEADMALE:Yes, I can.
SUPMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:It's me, Stan.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in, Stanley.
LEADFEMALE:We were just talking about you.
SUPFEMALE:I thought I felt my ears burning.
LEADMALE:Maybe that cheap toupee you're wearing retains heat.
LEADMALE:Stanley, why are you here? Michael and I made plans for tonight.
SUPFEMALE:You know, a real father-son evening, where we can rap and share our feelings and create good vibes.
LEADMALE:I can dig it.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you taking him? The Hacienda Hut.
OTHERMALE:I'll show him the town, give him some quality time.
SUPMALE:Maybe it'll make up for never teaching him how to ride a bicycle.
LEADMALE:Stanley, how come I've never seen you at the Hacienda Hut? I never have to stay long.
OTHERMALE:I'm a chick magnet.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why they call me Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Lucky.
LEADFEMALE:You mean, for 38 years I was Mrs.
LEADMALE:Lucky and never knew it? What about the present Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Lucky? Does she know what a maggot you are? Magnet, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:Magnet.
LEADMALE:Hey, Dad.
LEADMALE:I'll be with you in a second.
LEADMALE:Ma, could I see you in the kitchen? Look, Ma, I'm picking up the tab for dinner tonight and I feel kind of bad because I've never treated you.
LEADMALE:I mean, I love Dad, but you've always been there for me.
LEADMALE:Honey, don't worry.
LEADMALE:I'll always be there for you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad to hear that, Ma, because I ran out of cash.
LEADMALE:I need to borrow $30.
SUPMALE:$30? Michael, you're an adult.
LEADFEMALE:Do you really wanna beg your mother for $30? All right, fine.
LEADMALE:Forget it.
OTHERFEMALE:I hate this.
LEADMALE:Whenever I need money you make me feel like I'm asking.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, all right, all right.
LEADMALE:Oh, but look, all I have are two twenties.
LEADMALE:Great.
OTHERFEMALE:We can get appetizers.
SUPFEMALE:OK, let's jam.
LEADMALE:That's my boy.
LEADFEMALE:That's my dad.
SUPFEMALE:That's my money.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, you gave him money again? Oh! When are you gonna realize that you will never have a good relationship with your children until you stop doing all the things for them they should be doing for themselves.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, I finished your blouse.
LEADMALE:And the socks? Get right on it.
SUPFEMALE:So what am I supposed to do? You have to make him stand on his own two feet.
SUPFEMALE:If I were you, I'd kick him out.
SUPMALE:You really think I should do that? Kick him out.
SUPMALE:I know it sounds hard and cruel, but I've been reading about that very thing.
LEADMALE:It's called "rough love.
OTHERFEMALE:" No, I think it's "tough love.
LEADFEMALE:" Well, see there? We've both come up with something we oughta try.
LEADMALE:Michael? Hi, Ma.
LEADMALE:What are you doing up? Waiting up for you.
SUPFEMALE:I brought you something.
SUPFEMALE:Change for my 40? No, these little bamboo umbrellas.
LEADMALE:These are mine to keep, right? I stayed up because I want to talk to you.
LEADMALE:I want to know how the job hunt is going.
SUPFEMALE:There's not much out there right now.
OTHERMALE:You're sending out rÃ©sumÃ©s? Come on, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Musicians don't send out rÃ©sumÃ©s
LEADFEMALE:it's not like a job job.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're right.
SUPMALE:A job job is when you go to work regularly, bring home a paycheck and support yourself.
SUPFEMALE:OK.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:What's this all about? Michael, you are 30 years old.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to find your own place, cook your own food, and take responsibility for your life.
LEADMALE:But, Ma, that takes money.
LEADFEMALE:That's where the job job comes in.
SUPMALE:So what are you saying? You're kicking me out? No.
LEADFEMALE:I'm forcing you to grow up.
LEADFEMALE:Fine, I'll pack my things now.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Since I sprung this on you out of the blue, let's say you can stay here for another week.
SUPMALE:What, and put off growing up? Nah.
SUPMALE:I'm outta here.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, what the hell are you listening to? It's a relaxation tape.
SUPFEMALE:The rain is supposed to relax me.
SUPMALE:Is it working? Not really.
LEADMALE:I keep worrying that I left my car windows down.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dorothy, I feel so helpless.
SUPFEMALE:I get upset every time I think about it.
LEADMALE:Now, look, Rose, stop whining.
LEADMALE:You're going to have to speak to your boss about your workload.
LEADMALE:Wallowing in self-pity is not going to help.
LEADFEMALE:How are you feeling, Dorothy? My life is falling apart.
SUPMALE:And now Rose is bothering me.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, I'm sorry I bothered you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry I snapped at you, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that I'm upset.
SUPFEMALE:I am very upset.
LEADMALE:It is because you threw Michael out? No, it's because I can't make any sense out of those commercials for Obsession.
SUPMALE:Of course it's because of Michael.
SUPMALE:You just did what you had to.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, knowing that does not help.
LEADMALE:I am going crazy wondering where he is.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, he could be sleeping under a pier, for all I know.
LEADFEMALE:Or in some flophouse.
LEADFEMALE:Or out on the street.
SUPFEMALE:Michael called.
LEADFEMALE:He's staying with Stan.
OTHERMALE:Oh, God, it's even worse than I thought! At least he can depend on one of this parents.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Ma, I told you why I know, and you're wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Your brother Phil is much older than Michael and I still send him money.
LEADMALE:And do you know why? Where I was brought up, you never turn your back on family.
SUPFEMALE:Never.
SUPFEMALE:I know, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:When your crazy cousin Nunzio started living with his pet goat, did the family turn its back on him? No.
LEADMALE:And after a couple of nights neither did the goat.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, this really isn't your problem anymore.
SUPMALE:It's Michael's.
SUPMALE:He just has to learn the things we need to know to be an adult.
LEADMALE:Like how to earn a living, how to pay the rent, how to be courteous to your Friday-night mistake on Saturday morning.
LEADFEMALE:I still have to work on that last one myself.
LEADMALE:Why does it have to be so hard? The hardest part for me was explaining to my Kirsten the difference between boys and girls.
LEADFEMALE:I knew the time had come, but I kept putting it off.
OTHERFEMALE:Finally, I decided it was time to take the bull by the horns.
OTHERFEMALE:So you told her? No, I took the bull by the horns, turned him around and showed her what makes a bull a bull.
LEADMALE:You are kidding, Rose? No! That's how my mother taught me.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, didn't that give you a false impression about what a man would look like? It sure did.
SUPFEMALE:Can you imagine my surprise on my wedding night with Charlie?  Boy, that bull would have been jealous.
LEADFEMALE:I just wish somebody could tell me I've done the right thing.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, you've done the right thing.
LEADMALE:Rose, tell me more about Charlie.
LEADMALE:Not now, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, I know you've done the right thing.
OTHERMALE:In the animal kingdom, the whole idea is to teach offspring to fend for themselves.
LEADMALE:Humans are the only ones who think it's their duty to care for children their entire lives.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Rose, sometimes you really say some wise things.
LEADMALE:We're also the only species who use corn holders that look like corn on the cob when we eat corn on the cob.
SUPMALE:Oops! Spoke too soon.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Rose, is your neck bothering you again? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:And I'm gonna do something about it.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you've come to your senses.
LEADFEMALE:There is nothing worse than a pain in the neck.
SUPMALE:I must be psychic.
LEADMALE:Stanley, why are you here? We need to talk.
LEADMALE:Let's go in the kitchen.
OTHERMALE:Is this private? No.
LEADFEMALE:I'm hungry
LEADMALE:you got any bagels? Hello, Rose.
LEADMALE:OK, Stanley, what do you wanna talk about? It's about Michael.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong? What happened? Why do you have so many cheesecakes? What about Michael? He's fine.
LEADFEMALE:He's living the life of Riley.
LEADMALE:I cook his meals, I change his sheets, I pay his bills.
SUPFEMALE:He's making my life miserable, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Stanley, pull yourself together.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:It's not just the disruption to my life, it's seeing him do nothing with his.
LEADFEMALE:Stanley, you took him in.
LEADFEMALE:Now it is your problem, and you have to deal with it.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:There's only one thing I can do, and it's the hardest thing.
SUPFEMALE:You're going to ask Michael to leave your home.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna ask you to ask Michael to leave my home.
LEADFEMALE:He already resents you.
OTHERMALE:Why should he be mad at me too? I've heard enough.
SUPFEMALE:Get out.
LEADMALE:See? You're great at throwing people out.
LEADMALE:Stanley, you're going to have to throw your own son out of your own house.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I can't.
LEADFEMALE:How can I sit in judgment of how Michael lives his life? Here I am, a middle-aged man selling novelties for a living.
SUPFEMALE:Things could've been different if I'd applied myself You could have invented plastic vomit, instead of just selling it.
LEADFEMALE:Exactly.
LEADFEMALE:But Michael's different
SUPMALE:he's got real talent.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want to see him waste it.
LEADMALE:Then help him, Stan.
SUPMALE:How? Set an example.
SUPFEMALE:Show him that it's never too late to grow up.
SUPMALE:You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:It is time for me to show some maturity.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna be strong, Dorothy
SUPFEMALE:not just for Michael, but for myself.
LEADMALE:You know something, Stanley? This is a side of you I rarely see.
SUPFEMALE:And I must say, it's very attractive.
SUPFEMALE:Really? You wanna fool around? Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:More than anything.
SUPFEMALE:What is that? Sarcasm? I'm leaving.
LEADFEMALE:More around the eyes.
LEADMALE:I'm blending, Enrique.
LEADFEMALE:I want my public to trust me.
LEADMALE:Enrique Mas must have honest eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Try number 34.
LEADMALE:I heard Ted Koppel uses 34 around the eyes.
SUPFEMALE:Enrique.
LEADFEMALE:Rose.
LEADMALE:Do my eyes look honest enough? I, uh See? The lady hesitates.
LEADMALE:More around the eyes.
SUPFEMALE:Make me Cronkite.
OTHERMALE:Enrique since I've been working here I can't move my head anymore, my back hurts, I can't sleep, I have trouble digesting food, I see spots before my eyes I'm not a doctor, but I think it could be stress.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
LEADMALE:This sounds very important.
LEADFEMALE:We should discuss this over coffee.
LEADFEMALE:Cream and sugar? And a treat.
LEADMALE:Surprise me.
LEADMALE:You see, that's part of it.
SUPFEMALE:I can't possibly handle all the things you give me to do.
SUPMALE:Oh, I feel like such a failure.
LEADMALE:Here you've trusted me with a really important job, and I'm just not doing it.
LEADFEMALE:I know how hard your job is, and how good you are at it.
LEADMALE:Until you started working for me, my neck was like that.
LEADMALE:Well, no wonder I'm cracking.
LEADMALE:I don't want you to crack, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I need you.
LEADMALE:Do you believe that? Yes.
LEADMALE:Enough 34.
LEADFEMALE:Really, Rose, speaking from the heart and not from the makeup, you're the best.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I work you like a dog
LEADFEMALE:out of respect.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:But I don't want to kill you.
LEADMALE:So I'm going to hire an assistant for you, Rose.
SUPMALE:An assistant for me? I can't believe it! You can't? I must be fading.
SUPFEMALE:More 34.
SUPMALE:Rose, first thing tomorrow you get your assistant.
SUPMALE:I want you to know that Dad asked me to leave.
LEADMALE:He said he agreed with you.
OTHERMALE:I don't get it
LEADFEMALE:you two never agreed about anything.
LEADMALE:I guess we both agree that we love you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you have a funny way of showing it.
SUPMALE:Because of this, I had to call the band and beg for my job back.
LEADFEMALE:You got it? Michael, that's wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:Wonderful? It's humiliating.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Michael.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I gotta catch a bus.
LEADFEMALE:You got my laundry? Michael, I want you to know I think what your mother did was right.
LEADMALE:You may not see it now, but you'll realize it later.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess this is goodbye.
LEADMALE:See? I came around to your side.
SUPFEMALE:You gave him money, didn't you? It's not like it's my money.
SUPFEMALE:I took it from your purse.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma, I don't know if he'll ever forgive me.
OTHERMALE:The day you left me at Shady Pines, do you remember what I told you? Of course.
LEADMALE:You told me you'd never forgive me.
LEADFEMALE:But look at us now.
LEADMALE:Everything's fine.
SUPMALE:You're saying no matter how bad things are between Michael and me, they'll change? No.
LEADFEMALE:I'm saying that when Michael is 83 and his retirement home burns down, your Oh.
OTHERMALE:That's right
SUPFEMALE:you'll be dead.
LEADFEMALE:See you, pussycat.
OTHERFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Blanche.
OTHERMALE:Your picture's in the paper.
SUPMALE:And there's a big article about the Citrus Festival.
SUPMALE:What's it say, what's it say? "Miami will be busy this weekend with ten major conventions.
SUPFEMALE:" Listen to this.
LEADMALE:"The highlight being the Citrus Festival Ball, "which is being chaired this year by 35-year-old Blanche Devereaux.
SUPFEMALE:" How much did that cost you? I don't have to pay for my compliments.
OTHERFEMALE:You went to bed with him? Twice.
SUPMALE:But it's not like I wouldn't have anyway.
LEADMALE:Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:The newspaper's here.
LEADFEMALE:Gimme the classifieds.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma, Ma, you're not gonna answer ads in the personals again, are you? We got a lot of complaints last time.
LEADMALE:Hey, he asked for a single white female who likes to party, and he got one.
LEADMALE:No, I need to make some extra money.
SUPMALE:What for? When you get to be my age, the quality of your life changes.
LEADFEMALE:While you're at work, I'm here by myself all day, and it gets lonely.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I could stay home more.
OTHERFEMALE:Or we could get a giant-screen TV.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Ma, we can't afford that.
SUPFEMALE:That's the thing.
OTHERMALE:The classifieds are filled with ads from people who couldn't find a hotel this weekend, and want to rent a room anyplace they can.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not opening my home to boarders.
LEADMALE:Oh, they usually just turn out to be lowlife trash who'll make a mess, and half the time you can't get your money from 'em.
SUPFEMALE:Which reminds me, Rose, your rent check is late.
LEADMALE:Hello? Yes, she is.
LEADFEMALE:It's for you, Leona.
LEADFEMALE:Who is it? Your father.
LEADMALE:Big Daddy? Is that you, Big Daddy? Hello, darling, how are you? Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Well, darling, I can't come see you this weekend.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, I mean it.
LEADFEMALE:If it had been any other weekend I know, but I'm queen of a ball.
SUPFEMALE:Ain't that something? Here, listen to this.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:"The highlight being the Citrus Festival Ball, "which is being chaired this year by 35-year-old Blanche Devereaux.
SUPMALE:" Twice.
LEADMALE:I probably would have anyway, though.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry I can't come see you this weekend, but I'll check in with you on Monday.
LEADMALE:I love you too.
LEADMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:How is Big Daddy? I think he's just missing me.
SUPMALE:He's a little blue.
LEADMALE:But when this festival is over, I'll fly up and spend a few days with him.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this, look! Here's a couple that's willing to pay $400 a night for a room.
OTHERMALE:$400? Back in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf, the most expensive room was $18.
LEADFEMALE:50.
LEADMALE:And that includes the cow.
SUPFEMALE:All right, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Why would you want a cow in the room? It's the law.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you so much.
LEADMALE:Oh, everybody get in here! Come and see what I just got.
SUPMALE:What is it, Blanche? My commemorative plate from the Citrus Festival just arrived.
LEADFEMALE:Can I see it? Oh, no, darling, don't touch it.
SUPMALE:Nobody must touch it.
LEADMALE:It is very rare.
OTHERMALE:Only the five people on the committee get these each year.
SUPMALE:Oh, look.
SUPFEMALE:Have you ever seen a more moving piece of art? Only at Graceland.
SUPFEMALE:See what it says?  Hello? Who's calling? Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:Hang on.
LEADMALE:Blanche, it's your sister, Virginia.
OTHERMALE:Oh, for goodness Virginia, honey, is that you? I swear the whole family's coming out of the woodwork.
LEADMALE:Guess what? I'm queen of a ball.
OTHERMALE:Twice.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but I probably would have anyway.
SUPMALE:What? I spoke to Big Daddy just yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:I see.
SUPFEMALE:All right, I'll be there as soon as I can.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, what is it? Oh, it's Big Daddy.
SUPMALE:He's dead.
SUPMALE:Well, if you're as friendly as your skies are, I'd sure love to get together sometime.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:I have a flight to Atlanta first thing tomorrow morning.
LEADMALE:Blanche, honey, are you sure that you don't want one of us to go with you? Don't be silly, I'm fine.
SUPFEMALE:I'll just fly up to Atlanta tomorrow morning, tell Big Daddy I love him, and be back here in time to be queen of the ball.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, you can't do that.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? Big Daddy isn't dead.
SUPMALE:I think Virginia's playing a little practical joke.
OTHERMALE:What kind of a person plays a joke like that? You want to play a joke, you ring somebody's doorbell and run away.
LEADMALE:Or you shorten the leg on somebody's walker so it wobbles.
LEADMALE:Or you arrange for somebody to go on a long car trip with Rose.
SUPFEMALE:You don't tell them their father's dead.
LEADMALE:Now, look.
LEADMALE:Big Daddy didn't sound sick when I talked to him.
LEADFEMALE:He was just missing me.
OTHERFEMALE:That Virginia's always accusing me of not being there when the family needs me.
LEADFEMALE:This is just her way of getting me to rush home.
OTHERFEMALE:Believe me, everything's fine.
LEADMALE:Well, just the same, Blanche, I think I'd better go to Atlanta with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Whatever you want to do.
SUPMALE:Ketchup to go on my lima beans.
LEADMALE:Why? Oh, he sometimes ate 'em that way.
SUPMALE:He'd make up stories about how that's the way the kings and queens of Europe ate 'em.
SUPMALE:He always made it sound so special.
LEADMALE:He always made everything sound so damned special.
LEADMALE:Oh, God, why didn't I go when he called? Why didn't I go? And this is the living room.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, it's a lovely home.
SUPMALE:I better go check and see if the water for our tea is boiling.
SUPMALE:There's so many memories connected to this room.
LEADMALE:We used to have our big family reunions in here.
LEADFEMALE:Generations of Hollingsworths would gather round Big Daddy with his bourbon.
LEADFEMALE:While he sat there in front of a roaring fire regaling everybody with stories of the Old South, I'd sneak away up to my room and make out with cousin Abernathy.
SUPMALE:The room has that sense of tradition.
LEADFEMALE:Virginia.
LEADMALE:Hello, Blanche, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Virginia, so sorry about your father.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Nice of you to come.
LEADMALE:I was just going to make tea.
LEADFEMALE:Anybody want anything else? Oh, not me, thank you.
SUPMALE:I'm too upset to eat.
LEADMALE:I may never eat again.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you're right, I should keep up my strength.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, something with frosting.
LEADMALE:Come here, sister, and give me a big hug.
LEADMALE:It's just a little late to be sharing a beautiful moment, don't you think? Where were you, Blanche? He wanted you.
LEADMALE:He did not sound that sick on the phone.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, I told him I'd be here to see him soon.
OTHERMALE:And don't you get so righteous with me.
LEADFEMALE:Plenty of times you weren't there for him.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? Always trying to make me out to be the inconsiderate one.
LEADFEMALE:I remember when you were 16 and didn't come home for Father's Day.
LEADFEMALE:I was away at school.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes.
SUPMALE:The Good Samaritan Academy for the Knocked-Up.
LEADMALE:Two, four, six, eight, all us girls are three months late.
LEADMALE:That was wonderful for him.
LEADMALE:Didn't hurt him half as much as when you were 18, went off to Europe with that guy, Phil.
OTHERFEMALE:It was Philippe.
SUPFEMALE:And Big Daddy understood how romantic it was to go live in Copenhagen with a tortured painter.
OTHERMALE:He painted houses, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:You are the one who has never been here for the family.
LEADMALE:You.
LEADFEMALE:I have always been here for this family, and how dare you say otherwise.
SUPMALE:Everything you do is for Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:To tell you the truth, I am surprised that you even made it to the funeral at all.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you would have been happier if I hadn't.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe not happier.
LEADFEMALE:But at least this family would be able to grieve for Big Daddy without wondering what is in it for Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, fine.
LEADMALE:You don't have a thing to worry about.
LEADFEMALE:You won't have to think about Blanche.
LEADMALE:Because if you're gonna be at that funeral I refuse to go.
LEADFEMALE:OK, I want to go over a few of the house rules.
SUPFEMALE:You share the bathroom with Dorothy's room.
SUPMALE:The people across the street are out of town so you can use their pool.
LEADFEMALE:They're friends of ours, so try and pick up after yourselves.
OTHERMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Oh! Oh, I'm sorry, but you're not supposed to eat off that plate.
LEADMALE:That's Blanche's Citrus Festival plate.
SUPFEMALE:Are you staying here too? We're in the room at the end of the hall.
LEADMALE:I'm Peter, this is my wife, Maddy.
LEADFEMALE:What room are you in? I'd better check.
LEADMALE:Sophia, who are Peter and Maddy and why are they staying in Blanche's room? Because Dorothy's room and your room are already rented.
LEADFEMALE:Well, where am I gonna sleep? I could rent you half of my room.
OTHERMALE:Sophia, you can't do this.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy said-- Forget about what Dorothy said.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want me to do? Kick them out? There's not a room in town.
LEADMALE:These people come from a small town in Iowa, much like St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf.
OTHERMALE:Really? I don't lie about stuff like this, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:The good people in that town saved and sacrificed so that Peter and Maddy could have one weekend of fun before his operation.
SUPFEMALE:Well, he looks fine.
SUPMALE:Oh, tell him that.
LEADMALE:Look, call me crazy.
SUPMALE:I don't see anything wrong with giving a veteran his last wish, and making some dough.
SUPMALE:Well, I guess they can stay.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Here, take this out there, make sure they pay.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I don't think it's right to charge them.
SUPFEMALE:Neither do I, but he hates pity.
LEADMALE:I understand.
LEADMALE:What a tool.
LEADMALE:Blanche, if you want to change your mind, there's still time to get to the funeral.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, come look at these old pictures.
LEADFEMALE:I'm about ten years old in this one.
SUPMALE:Big Daddy just taught me how to ride a horse.
OTHERFEMALE:You were quite a little porker back then, weren't you? I was a little chunky, that's all.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, the horse's eyes are crossed.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:You were fat.
LEADMALE:Every little girl goes through that ugly stage.
SUPMALE:Ugly, yes.
SUPMALE:But this is ugly and fat.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:You seem to be getting a little bit too much pleasure out of all this.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:It's just that you've always described yourself as being a great beauty.
LEADMALE:It's interesting to see that you were Plump.
LEADMALE:fat.
LEADMALE:Enough.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Fat, fat, water rat, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I'll stop.
SUPMALE:I'll stop.
SUPMALE:But could I have a copy of this? All right, I was fat.
LEADMALE:I can say it.
LEADMALE:But only because I blossomed into the extraordinary woman I am today.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Big Daddy didn't care.
OTHERFEMALE:He always said I was beautiful.
LEADMALE:He was so proud.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, there's nobody to be proud of me anymore, you know what I mean? Yeah.
LEADMALE:You know, when anything good happens to me, I still can't wait to tell Ma.
SUPMALE:Listen, Blanche, I think you have to go to the funeral.
LEADFEMALE:You wanted to be there for him, be there for him now.
LEADFEMALE:Don't let this argument with Virginia stand in your way.
SUPMALE:Blanche, you're never gonna feel complete until you get to say goodbye.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:If I go to that funeral, he's dead.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, he is.
LEADMALE:Look here.
LEADMALE:This is when I was crowned Azalea Queen.
OTHERFEMALE:Wasn't I beautiful then? And you still haven't lost it.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, this picture was taken two years after I lost it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Look.
LEADMALE:Aw!  The first marine he found the bean, parlez-vous? The second marine, he cooked the bean, parlez-vous? The third marine, he ate the bean, rolled over the submarine Inky-dinky parlez-vous?  Oh, nice people.
OTHERMALE:Sophia, you didn't say anything about parties in the house.
OTHERMALE:Oh, so Peter and Maddy are having a few friends over.
LEADMALE:We're making a bundle.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I wish we had thought of putting in a pay toilet.
LEADMALE:Hello? It was Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Hide me.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, you answer it.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna answer it.
LEADMALE:I don't want to have to lie for you.
LEADFEMALE:It's your daughter.
OTHERFEMALE:We're not that close.
LEADMALE:You better answer it the next time.
SUPFEMALE:She's gonna get mad.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? Oh, hello, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:No, it didn't ring here.
SUPMALE:Why? No, everything's fine here.
LEADMALE:Sophia?  Tell her I'm in church.
LEADMALE:She's in church.
LEADMALE:I said, she's in church.
SUPMALE:No, things couldn't be better here.
SUPFEMALE:How's it going there? Oh, that's good.
LEADFEMALE:Then I'll see you tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Give my love to Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:I hate lying! It goes against my nature.
LEADMALE:I guess that's because growing up in St.
SUPMALE:Olaf, one day every year, they'd gather all the children who lied in the town square and the mayor would point at them.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, you got any glue? Oh! Blanche's plate! What are we gonna tell her? The truth.
LEADMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:I just need a few minutes to come up with it.
LEADMALE:These are for you, Mama.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Big Daddy.
OTHERFEMALE:I couldn't go home without telling you why I didn't come to your funeral.
SUPFEMALE:Same old reason.
LEADFEMALE:I was being selfish.
SUPMALE:Thinking too much about how I was feeling, instead of coming out here to pay my loving respects.
SUPFEMALE:You know, going through those photograph albums yesterday, with Dorothy, I realized that I haven't always been easy to love.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I was a horrible child.
SUPFEMALE:Rebellious, difficult.
LEADMALE:But you always made me feel loved and beautiful.
SUPMALE:Even when I did make it hard on you.
LEADFEMALE:I know I haven't always given much back, honey.
LEADMALE:I was always so worried about me.
LEADMALE:Why, I couldn't even come and see you when you needed me, before you died, 'cause I was all caught up in that old silly ball.
LEADMALE:There is no excuse for that.
SUPFEMALE:Although I was the ball queen, did I tell you that? Oh, that's right, I did.
SUPMALE:Well, here I am, all caught up in myself still.
LEADMALE:Fighting with Virginia and the rest of the family when we ought to be comforting each other.
SUPMALE:I just feel like such a fool.
LEADFEMALE:I would give up everything that I ever thought meant anything to me if I could have one moment with you.
OTHERMALE:I don't know if love can help you, wherever you are, but if it can, honey, you got it.
OTHERFEMALE:'Cause Big Daddy, I do love you so much.
LEADMALE:I just wish there was some way I could know you're hearing what I'm saying.
LEADMALE:Blanche Oh, Lordy Why, Dorothy, what are you doing? I'm sorry, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Cab driver says we'd better get going if we want to make our plane.
LEADFEMALE:Big Daddy, you remember Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Honey, I have to go now.
SUPMALE:You're in my prayers.
OTHERFEMALE:You take good care of him, Mama.
SUPMALE:You hear me? I love you.
SUPFEMALE:I love you both.
LEADFEMALE:I'm nobody's little girl anymore.
SUPMALE:Rose, this was a great weekend! We made $1700.
LEADMALE:So I can get my TV.
LEADFEMALE:And I've worked out what we can tell Blanche about that plate.
LEADFEMALE:I wrote it down.
LEADMALE:You be Rose, why don't I be Sophia.
SUPMALE:This is what we'll say right after they walk in the door.
OTHERFEMALE:"Hi, Blanche.
LEADMALE:You look beautiful.
LEADMALE:Welcome home.
SUPFEMALE:I love you.
OTHERMALE:" "I broke the plate.
LEADMALE:I'm such a clumsy fool.
SUPFEMALE:" OK.
SUPFEMALE:Now you can skip down to here.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not gonna do this! You gotta.
SUPMALE:If it's the writing, I can punch it up.
LEADMALE:Did you call about buying the Citrus Festival plate? Yes, I did.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose.
OTHERMALE:You're beautiful.
LEADMALE:How much do you want for it? Well, they're pretty rare.
SUPFEMALE:There's only five of these.
LEADFEMALE:I'd say $2000.
SUPMALE:$2000 a plate? What is this? A Republican fundraiser? Look, these plates are collector's items.
LEADMALE:I'm only doing this because you've said you're in a jam.
LEADMALE:Sir, we have $1700 cash.
LEADMALE:That's it.
OTHERMALE:I'll take it.
SUPFEMALE:Give him the money, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:But my TV.
SUPMALE:How about a hundred dollars and we'll show you a good time? Give him the money.
LEADMALE:Nice doing business with you.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, everybody.
LEADMALE:Hello there.
OTHERFEMALE:Who was that? Gasman.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it's so good to see you both home.
SUPMALE:We took good care of your plate, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I became a new person on this trip.
LEADMALE:I realized that we have so little time while we're here together, we must cherish each and every moment.
SUPFEMALE:Now, this plate represents the old me.
LEADFEMALE:I feel wonderful.
LEADMALE:I could go for some cheesecake.
LEADFEMALE:What is this? Sarcasm? 
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Hey!  Rose, for the past half-hour, you've been humming "Jingle Bells" and yelling "Hey!" Now, why must you do that? Because it's too hard to hum the "Hey!" Oh, boy, it is hell out there.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it must be at least 103, and the mall was impossible.
SUPMALE:Did you get something for the grandchildren? Oh, please.
LEADMALE:You know, Robbie wants a Batman hat.
SUPFEMALE:I went to six different stores.
LEADMALE:They were all sold out.
LEADMALE:I finally went to one store where they had one hat left, and another woman saw it.
LEADMALE:Oh! I cannot believe a person would push a perfect stranger out of the way, step on her hand, and give her an elbow to the forehead just for a Batman hat
LEADMALE:but I did it anyway.
SUPMALE:I got the hat.
SUPFEMALE:No, I guess I just have this thing about giving gifts that are more fun than the ones my grandparents used to give me.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, do you remember that Christmas they gave me soap in the shape of the Seven Dwarfs? Well, now what's wrong with that? What kid wants to play with soap? Besides, after a couple of baths, they looked like seven suppositories.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:It's me, Stan.
SUPMALE:I brought you a gift.
LEADMALE:Oh, why, thank you, Stanley.
LEADMALE:Oh, and look, there's a little card.
SUPMALE:"Merry Christmas, Sports Illustrated subscriber.
OTHERFEMALE:" You don't have a baseball radio, do you, Dorothy? Stanley, why are you really here? I am going to make all you women wealthy.
LEADMALE:How come whenever my ship comes in, it's leaking? I am planning on opening a research and development lab.
LEADMALE:We can come up with new and exciting novelties that will make today's plastic vomit obsolete.
LEADMALE:To make all of this happen, all I need from each of you is $1,000.
OTHERMALE:What do you say?  No.
LEADMALE:OK, make it 100, but no monthly report.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, Stanley.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't I just wait outside, give you a few minutes to think this over? Fine.
SUPMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:If he's still here in the morning, let's give him coffee, OK? It's a nightmare.
SUPMALE:We've been visited by the yutz of Christmas past.
SUPMALE:I am drained of what little holiday spirit I had.
LEADFEMALE:That's too bad, because we still have to shop for presents for each other.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, I've been giving this a lot of thought.
OTHERFEMALE:None of us wants to go shopping in this terrible heat, so why don't we just put names into a hat, and then we just have to pick out a gift for the one person whose name we pick? There's only one problem with your plan, pussycat.
SUPMALE:One of us is gonna get the gift from Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, she's right.
SUPMALE:And you know how hard it is pretending to like Rose's gifts.
SUPMALE:Uh-uh.
OTHERFEMALE:Forget it.
LEADFEMALE:No way.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on, now, Blanche, don't be so childish.
SUPMALE:We each stand an equal chance of having our Christmas ruined.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not going to bother me if I get Rose's gift.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy's right.
SUPFEMALE:Be a good sport.
LEADMALE:Rose, I have to tell you about Christmas.
LEADMALE:It is too hot to shop, the stores are mobbed, and there are only two days left.
LEADFEMALE:So we've decided to draw names out of a hat.
SUPMALE:And that way, each of us only has to buy one gift.
SUPMALE:But, Dorothy, I love shopping, and I love giving gifts.
LEADFEMALE:And besides, if we draw names out of a hat, whose names are they gonna be anyway? The Oak Ridge Boys', Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:Our names! Oh! Gee, I'm not sure about this.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, when you think about Christmas, don't you think about giving gifts? Yes, but that's not the first thing.
LEADFEMALE:When I think of Christmas, I think of Christmas in New York.
OTHERFEMALE:The decorations in Macy's window, the show at Radio City, skaters on the ice at Mitsubishi Center.
LEADMALE:In the old days on Christmas Eve we used to go to midnight Mass, remember, Dorothy? Sure I do.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma, the music and the candles
OTHERMALE:it was beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:And the Mass was in Latin, a fine old Italian language.
LEADMALE:Now, who knows! Sometimes it's in English, sometimes Spanish.
LEADFEMALE:If you ask me, they should go back to Latin, the language Jesus spoke.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, he spoke Hebrew.
OTHERMALE:Even in church? You know, I've been thinking Oh, that would explain the beads of sweat.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe Dorothy's right.
OTHERMALE:I guess I don't need a shopping spree to give me the Christmas spirit.
LEADMALE:My church is serving Christmas dinner to the poor people in the neighborhood, and I've volunteered to go and help serve.
LEADFEMALE:That'll do the trick for me.
OTHERFEMALE:OK, then let's do it.
OTHERMALE:Come on, now, look Remember, you only buy for the person whose name you pick.
SUPFEMALE:And it doesn't matter who picks you, because it's bound to be a terrific gift.
SUPFEMALE:Go ahead, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:OK.
LEADFEMALE:OK, I buy for Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes! Yes, yes, yes! Oh, yes! Oh Boy, Blanche, I didn't realize you were such a big spender.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead, Dorothy, you go.
LEADMALE:OK, I buy for Ma.
LEADMALE:Yes! Ha ha! This really was a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:This is really fun.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, shut up, Rose.
SUPMALE:Is it my turn? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:OK.
SUPMALE:I buy for Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you, God! No, no, no, Rose, you can't pick yourself.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank goodness.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so hard to shop for.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, you buy for Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:OK, thanks, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:This really was a good idea.
SUPFEMALE:I don't wanna spoil the surprise, but in a couple of weeks someone in this room is gonna know how to yodel.
SUPMALE:Your brother Phil, God rest his brain, gives the worst presents in the world.
SUPFEMALE:What kind of gift is dental floss? Well, it's waxed and mint-flavored.
SUPFEMALE:Here, go floss yourself.
SUPMALE:This stinks
SUPFEMALE:after the swell gift I sent him? What was it? A catalogue item.
LEADMALE:L.
LEADFEMALE:L.
LEADFEMALE:Bean? Victoria's Secret.
LEADMALE:Here it is, my present from Kirsten.
LEADMALE:Oh, she always knows just what her mother wants.
LEADMALE:Ha ha! It's a St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf snowball.
LEADMALE:Rose, there's nothing in there but snow.
LEADFEMALE:That's what St.
SUPMALE:Olaf looks like in winter.
LEADFEMALE:Who's for some fresh-baked Christmas cookies? Rose, why are the Christmas cookies in the shape of American flags and Liberty Bells? I couldn't find a Christmas cookie-cutter, so I used the Fourth of July cookie-cutters instead.
SUPMALE:I wonder where President Bush stands on eating the flag? Well, that's all the presents
SUPMALE:except for the ones we know are fruitcakes.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:What about the present Blanche hid behind the couch? Oh, my gift for you.
SUPMALE:I'll get it.
LEADMALE:I can't wait to see the look on your face.
SUPMALE:Me too.
LEADMALE:Here you go, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Why, Rose, it's a beautiful blouse! I hope it's all right.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy said you'd like something crotchless.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm due at church in about half an hour.
SUPMALE:They're starting to serve Christmas dinner at one o'clock.
LEADFEMALE:I better get ready.
LEADMALE:Hey, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, could you use some extra help? We could use all the help we can get.
SUPMALE:Then I'm going with you.
LEADMALE:Hey, count me in.
OTHERFEMALE:Since I didn't get a gift I have to bury out in the backyard, I'm feeling all Christmassy too.
LEADMALE:Ma, are you coming? But I rented Scarface! All right, I'll go too.
LEADMALE:Hey, I got an idea.
LEADFEMALE:We got all these fruitcakes from this Christmas, last Christmas and the Christmas before that.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we gather them all up and And what? Build a bomb shelter? No.
OTHERFEMALE:We can unload them.
SUPMALE:I mean, bring 'em to the church for dessert.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, actually, I think that's very nice.
LEADFEMALE:Like we say in St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf, Christmas without fruitcake is like St.
OTHERFEMALE:Sigmund's Day without the headless boy! Well, before we open the doors, I just wanna thank you all for taking time away from your own Christmas to provide Christmas for some that are less fortunate.
LEADFEMALE:We promise to turn away no one, remembering how Mary and Joseph were turned away at the inn.
SUPFEMALE:Reverend Avery, it's always puzzled me
LEADFEMALE:why didn't Mary and Joseph call ahead for reservations? Surely they must have realized how impossible it is to get a hotel room during the Christmas season? I guess that's one for the theologians, Rose.
LEADMALE:I can never get used to serving turkey for Christmas dinner
SUPFEMALE:it's so un-Sicilian.
OTHERFEMALE:What did you serve? Eels.
SUPMALE:Eels?  Yeah, it's true.
LEADFEMALE:Eels are a traditional part of a Sicilian Christmas.
OTHERMALE:Of course, after Christmas, it's eel croquettes, eel hash, eel tetrazzini.
OTHERMALE:I sure miss a traditional St.
SUPMALE:Olaf Christmas.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, Rose, do we have time to run out and get hit by a bus? First there'd be the Christmas pageant, with the shepherds and the angels and the two wise men.
SUPFEMALE:There were three wise men, Rose.
LEADMALE:Not in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf.
OTHERMALE:Then we'd all go down to the town square and try to form a circle.
LEADMALE:And then we'd all go home and smoke kippers.
SUPFEMALE:Why, Rose? Because it's the best way to get your house to smell like kippers.
LEADMALE:And then in keeping with the spirit of Christmas, it was traditional to let all the animals sleep inside that night.
LEADMALE:And then, the next morning, the rumors would start.
OTHERFEMALE:And they'd continue until New Year's, and we'd all make resolutions that it would never happen again.
LEADMALE:But then, the next year, all it took was a little eggnog and one wise guy saying, "What the hell! It's Christmas.
LEADFEMALE:" All right, volunteers, stand by.
LEADMALE:I'm opening the doors.
LEADMALE:Welcome.
SUPMALE:Welcome, everybody.
OTHERMALE:Merry Christmas.
SUPMALE:I just never thought there'd be children.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:And what is Santa Claus doing here? Oh, they pay these poor, out-of-work guys 10, 15 bucks to stand on street corners ringing their bells for charitable contributions.
SUPFEMALE:A lot of 'em can't afford the price of a meal.
LEADMALE:Hello there.
OTHERMALE:Hello, Santa Claus.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy it's me, Stanley.
SUPMALE:Stan, what are you doing here? What happened with the research and development deal? Ah, that was just me trying to get some extra cash to tide me through the holidays.
LEADFEMALE:You were gonna cheat us? Oh, sure, if you wanna label everything.
OTHERFEMALE:Stan, how could you? What did you want me to tell you, Dorothy, that I was broke, that I miscalculated the public taste? I thought I was gonna go through the roof with my plastic reindeer poop.
SUPMALE:That's what happens when you aim too high.
LEADFEMALE:And then I figured, with the drought and the danger of fires, the one novelty item that would really take off this season is a little Santa wearing sunglasses, driving a fire engine.
LEADFEMALE:So I put every last cent I had into that hunch, and I ordered 12 gross from my supplier in Germany.
SUPMALE:Everything is getting out of East Berlin except my fire engines.
OTHERFEMALE:They didn't get here till last night.
LEADMALE:Come on, Stanley, you've been down before.
SUPFEMALE:This is the nature of your business.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you go home and enjoy Christmas, then face the future tomorrow? I can't go home.
LEADMALE:Why not? Catherine threw me out.
SUPFEMALE:Your wife threw you out? I had no idea she was that bright.
SUPMALE:What happened? Catherine accused me of infidelity.
LEADMALE:Oh, dammit! Stan, this makes those infidelities during our marriage seem much less special.
LEADFEMALE:Why did this have to happen to me? Broke and homeless on Christmas
SUPFEMALE:why me? Why you? Why them?! Look around you.
LEADFEMALE:You're not exactly alone.
SUPFEMALE:This is probably the only Christmas these kids are gonna have.
LEADMALE:Think about that for a while.
SUPMALE:It might take your mind off your own self-pity.
SUPFEMALE:I've gotta go back to work.
OTHERFEMALE:Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Sensitive.
LEADMALE:You know, being here reminds me of my favorite Christmas back in 1951, which I spent at the USO, making a better Christmas for our boys getting ready to leave for Korea.
LEADFEMALE:I gave those servicemen something even Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bob Hope himself could not give them.
LEADFEMALE:A rash? Doughnuts, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Big Daddy was part-owner of a doughnut shop.
LEADFEMALE:Did you really think this was going to be a story about sex? This is a beautiful Christmas story, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Now, that really hurts me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Well, anyway, after the boys had their doughnuts Actually, at this point, it does change more into a Veterans Day story.
LEADMALE:In fact, what happened to Dorothy's ex-husband is not that uncommon.
LEADMALE:Really? You'd be surprised how many people are only two or three paychecks away from being on the street.
SUPFEMALE:The suddenly poor are all around us.
SUPMALE:Once you've been knocked down like that, it's very hard to recover.
LEADFEMALE:What's going to happen to all these people? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:There's no affordable housing, the rents keep going up and up, and the minimum wage has been held down.
LEADFEMALE:Seems so unfair.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that's because it is.
LEADFEMALE:There are three million homeless, hungry people in this country.
SUPFEMALE:What bothers me is, those people out there are being fed today because it's Christmas, but what will they eat tomorrow? When the great communicator talked about his vision of a city on a hill, I wonder if it included people sleeping on gratings in the street.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, Stan's out there feeling so sorry for himself, he's bringing down the homeless.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, will you take over for me? What are you gonna do? I'm gonna go and try to make Stan feel like a whole man again.
LEADMALE:Anything you need? Yes, half a man.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, you were just putting me on about those eels, right? Please! In Sicily, it wouldn't be Christmas without a plate of eels.
LEADFEMALE:Eels and larks.
OTHERMALE:Larks? Honey, larks aren't eating birds, they're singing birds.
LEADFEMALE:They don't sing long in Sicily.
LEADMALE:Stanley.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? I forgot to wish you a merry Christmas.
LEADMALE:Some Christmas.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Stanley, you're the most fortunate person here.
SUPFEMALE:Big deal! Stanley, you've always been able to turn bad holidays around.
SUPFEMALE:Do you remember the Christmas we were so broke that you actually convinced the kids that Christmas was the 26th, and then you went out and got a Christmas tree from somebody's garbage? You trimmed it with gum wrappers and pull tabs.
SUPMALE:And then you turned on the television, and they were playing Jim Thorpe
SUPMALE:All American, and you told the kids it was King of Kings.
SUPMALE:And they believed it, too.
LEADMALE:Right up to the part where Jesus had his Olympic medals taken away for playing professional baseball.
LEADMALE:That became sort of a tradition with us.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You had ingenuity then.
SUPMALE:You didn't let anything beat you.
LEADFEMALE:And you can do it again, Stan, if you just work hard and turn on that Zbornak charm.
SUPMALE:I am pretty good at that.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you could charm the pants off anybody.
LEADFEMALE:I have to believe that
LEADMALE:otherwise, I was easy.
LEADFEMALE:But, Dorothy, it's different this time.
SUPMALE:Sure, sure, I've scraped the bottom of the barrel before, but this time I don't even have a barrel! Oh, Stan, will you stop whining? It's pathetic.
SUPFEMALE:That's the most effective way to whine.
LEADMALE:All I need is a few bucks, just a little seed money.
OTHERFEMALE:OK, OK.
SUPMALE:Here, here.
LEADFEMALE:Stan, take it.
LEADFEMALE:Attagirl.
LEADFEMALE:To show you how much I love you, I'm not even going to count it.
LEADMALE:I hate you, Stanley.
LEADFEMALE:You are the lowest.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Dorothy, if I am no longer the man you divorced.
LEADFEMALE:So am I.
LEADMALE:I'd love to stick around and be belittled Fine, fine.
SUPFEMALE:You've eaten.
LEADMALE:Go somewhere else and wallow.
LEADMALE:You better be careful.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not the only ex-wife I have.
LEADFEMALE:Then why do you keep bothering me? You're the only one who answers the door.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess that about does it.
LEADMALE:All the food is gone.
LEADFEMALE:Except the fruitcake.
LEADMALE:I don't get it.
LEADFEMALE:There's more now than when we started.
OTHERMALE:I just wish there was something more we could do for these people.
LEADFEMALE:Especially the children.
SUPMALE:(Rev.
LEADMALE:Aubrey) Yes, I know.
LEADFEMALE:I'm supposed to look after their spiritual needs, but even I can't help thinking they have other needs that are far more pressing.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'd like to thank you all very much for coming.
LEADMALE:I wish you every blessing for the New Year.
SUPFEMALE:Merry Christmas! Ho-ho-ho! Here's Santa, with toys for all the good boys and girls.
SUPFEMALE:Ho-ho-ho! Have you all been good boys and girls?  Yeah! Ah! Ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!  Oh, my gosh.
LEADMALE:I'm proud of you, Stan.
SUPMALE:Really proud.
OTHERFEMALE:That was a lovely thing you did.
LEADMALE:You made me believe in Santa Claus again.
OTHERMALE:Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Not me
LEADFEMALE:I knew it was Stan all along.
SUPFEMALE:After I walked outta here this afternoon, I realized that I'm more fortunate than a lot of people.
SUPFEMALE:Tomorrow I'm gonna get the jump on the Easter season.
LEADFEMALE:I have a new idea for a great novelty.
LEADFEMALE:It's a decorated Easter egg with a window in it.
LEADFEMALE:When you look into it, you see a beautiful Easter scene.
SUPFEMALE:That's not a new idea.
SUPMALE:Those Easter eggs have been around for years and years.
LEADMALE:Yes, but this one leaves a black circle around your eyes.
LEADFEMALE:That practically screams Easter! And, you know, Dorothy, I apologized to my wife, and in the spirit of Christmas, she's letting me come back home.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:In that case, you can give me back the $60 I gave you.
OTHERMALE:Well, when I apologized, I said it with flowers.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, I may be a lot of things, but I'm not cheap.
LEADFEMALE:You know, actually, this is one of the best Christmases I ever spent with Stan.
LEADFEMALE:It was pretty nice.
LEADMALE:I can't remember feeling this proud of myself so early in the evening.
SUPFEMALE:No, we did good.
LEADMALE:I just wish we could do more.
LEADMALE:Oh, so do I.
SUPMALE:I mean, we have a place to go home to, and so many people don't.
LEADFEMALE:We should keep them in our hearts and our minds
SUPFEMALE:not just on Christmas, but every day of the year.
OTHERMALE:It's more than a place to go.
SUPMALE:It's having someone there for you.
LEADFEMALE:We have each other.
SUPMALE:There's always someone there.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, darling.
LEADFEMALE:So let's go home.
LEADMALE:Thanks, girls, for coming down and helping out.
LEADFEMALE:It was wonderful.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, thank you for having us.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad you asked.
OTHERMALE:And, hey, merry Christmas.
SUPFEMALE:Oh  Merry Christmas.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi, Ma.
OTHERMALE:Listen to this.
SUPFEMALE:"If I were truly free, O fire of my loins" "I'd take you to a paradise in the sun where we could lie naked, "bronzed body against pearl body, locked together in a frenzy of love.
OTHERFEMALE:" Ma, who wrote that?! Merrill Kellogg.
LEADFEMALE:Merrill Who's he? Ask Blanche.
OTHERMALE:It's her letter.
LEADFEMALE:This is from that guy in prison that Blanche has been writing to.
SUPFEMALE:How are you gonna explain this opened letter to Blanche? Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
LEADMALE:Morning, girls.
OTHERFEMALE:Good morning, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Rose opened your letter.
SUPMALE:Blanche, I didn't.
LEADMALE:It's no problem, honey.
SUPMALE:It's just another one of those letters from Merrill.
SUPMALE:I would read it to you anyway
LEADMALE:they're not personal.
LEADMALE:Not personal? The man said he wants to lie naked with you on a beach.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:And I wrote him I want to make passionate love to him in a hammock suspended between two magnolia trees
SUPMALE:you know that couldn't possibly happen.
SUPMALE:Well, maybe if you lose a few pounds Shut up, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:These letters are just a fantasy.
LEADFEMALE:The man is in prison for the next 20 years for armed robbery.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, I don't think it's right to lead the guy on like that.
LEADMALE:Why not? The poor man is surrounded by concrete and bars.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with bringing a little joy into his life? Nothing at all.
SUPFEMALE:Back in St.
OTHERMALE:Olaf, our justice system is very progressive.
LEADMALE:Their motto was, "Use a gun, go apologize.
LEADFEMALE:"   I'll get it.
SUPFEMALE:Mary, honey! Hi, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, welcome, stranger.
OTHERMALE:Come in here and sit down.
SUPFEMALE:So how've you been doing? Tell me, sweetheart, you having fun in high school? It's OK.
SUPMALE:Oh, I loved high school.
LEADFEMALE:It seems like only yesterday
OTHERMALE:riding around with the boys in their cars, and the dances Don't forget the Hindenburg disaster.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, look who's here.
LEADMALE:Oh! So, Mary, when's the baby due? Ma, you're talking to a 16-year-old girl.
LEADFEMALE:A knocked-up Ma, how did you know? Because you had the same look of panic on your face when you got pregnant.
SUPFEMALE:Kind of like a deer caught in the headlights of a car.
SUPMALE:I thought only pregnant teenagers had that expression, until I saw Dan Quayle on TV.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe it.
OTHERMALE:It was only yesterday you were selling us cookies.
SUPMALE:Now she's giving them away.
LEADMALE:Mary, honey, have you told your father? I tried, but since Mom died, I don't know, we're just on different wavelengths.
LEADMALE:Well, honey, what about the baby's father? After all, it's his responsibility, too.
LEADFEMALE:We broke up.
OTHERMALE:And besides, he's away at college now.
SUPMALE:What are you gonna do? I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:My father kicked me out.
LEADMALE:I got so many things I gotta figure out.
LEADMALE:I guess I gotta get a job and a place to stay.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mary, look, you have too many things to figure out.
LEADMALE:Why don't you stay here with us, until we can all decide what to do? Absolutely.
OTHERMALE:Really? Yes, we'll take care of you.
LEADMALE:I don't know how to thank you.
OTHERMALE:Now, you come into the kitchen with me, honey.
LEADMALE:I'll get you some pickles and ice cream.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have any strange cravings yet.
LEADMALE:Strange? I cannot believe her father could be so mean.
SUPMALE:Not half as mean as his dog Samson.
OTHERMALE:Did I ever tell you what that dog did to my friend Ida Silverman? No.
SUPMALE:What? He ate her.
LEADMALE:Gobbled her up without a trace, support hose and all.
LEADMALE:Ma, Ida's daughter told me she moved to Fort Lauderdale.
LEADMALE:The woman's in denial.
SUPMALE:I saw that dog with Ida's blue scarf in his mouth, and no one has seen her since.
LEADMALE:Ma, what does Fred's dog have to do with this? It's a known fact that dogs take on the personality traits of their masters.
LEADMALE:That's ridiculous.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? Then why does your brother Phil's poodle like to wear that tutu and hop around on his hind legs? Oh, come on, Ma.
LEADMALE:I mean, Phil would look pretty stupid doing that by himself.
SUPMALE:Rose.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose! Blanche, what's wrong? I never finished reading this letter from Merrill till just now.
LEADFEMALE:Read that last paragraph.
LEADMALE:"My sentence has been overturned on a technicality.
SUPMALE:"I'm getting out on the 21st.
SUPFEMALE:Now, finally, we can make all our dreams come true.
SUPMALE:" Isn't that terrible? He's written catchier stuff, but I wouldn't call it terrible.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not asking for a literary critique, you dweeb! Merrill gets out on the But isn't that great news? You can finally meet him.
LEADMALE:I don't want to meet him! I don't want him coming here
LEADMALE:the man's a convict.
LEADMALE:Oh, so Blanche's pen pal is getting out.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, that's gonna be rough.
SUPFEMALE:I bet after ten years in the jug, he's gonna be pretty short on foreplay.
LEADMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I brought you an extra blanket.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Seems like old times, huh? I love this house.
OTHERMALE:I love this room.
SUPFEMALE:I just feel so safe here.
LEADMALE:After I'd visit Mom in the hospital, I always was so glad to come back here.
LEADMALE:Now here I am again.
LEADMALE:Only, this time I'm pregnant.
LEADMALE:It's funny, huh? What's that, honey? It's just that I have another human being inside of me, and I've never felt more alone.
SUPMALE:Mary, that's why you have to talk to your father.
SUPFEMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, this is the most difficult thing for a father to accept.
LEADFEMALE:What, that I'm a grown woman? But you're not a grown woman.
LEADMALE:Just because the plumbing's in doesn't mean the house is ready to occupy.
OTHERFEMALE:I think I know what you're getting at.
OTHERMALE:Good, because I really didn't make that up myself.
SUPMALE:I heard it on This Old House.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I tried talking to my father, but he just went all crazy when I told him.
SUPMALE:That's what fathers do
LEADFEMALE:they yell and they barbecue.
LEADFEMALE:That's what separates them from the apes.
LEADMALE:What did your father do when he found out you were pregnant? He chased Stan for three blocks with a salami.
LEADFEMALE:How come? They don't leave marks.
LEADFEMALE:When he finally cooled down, he realized that he loved me more than anything in the world
LEADMALE:which was lucky for me, because I never needed him more than I did then.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think that's gonna happen with my dad.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you never know.
SUPFEMALE:Fathers can surprise you sometimes.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy? You remember when Mom was sick, you used to stay with me until I fell asleep? And I used to hold your hand Ma, what are you doing? Merrill called.
LEADMALE:He's coming over.
LEADMALE:I'm hiding all our valuables.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Why? You think the man went to prison for free coveralls and some male bonding?  Quick, give me a hand with the TV.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma! I cannot believe that Merrill is a dangerous criminal.
SUPMALE:I mean, you've read his letters.
LEADMALE:They're beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:They're poetic, almost lyrical.
LEADFEMALE:You can be sure he's a real gentleman.
LEADMALE:I want Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Break out the finger sandwiches.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Astaire looks like he's hungry.
LEADMALE:I'm Merrill.
SUPMALE:Are you Blanche? No.
LEADMALE:How about you, cutie? Boy, this guy's done hard time! No, Blanche isn't here, and she won't be back for a long, long time.
LEADMALE:That's all right.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been in prison ten years.
OTHERMALE:I'm real good at waiting.
LEADFEMALE:Uh Can I get you something, Merrill? No.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, those were lovely letters that you wrote to Blanche, Merrill.
SUPFEMALE:No, I didn't write 'em.
OTHERMALE:Walter, the guy in the next cell, did.
LEADFEMALE:Wrote 'em to Harley, the night guard.
LEADMALE:He's hoping to round himself up a date for movie night.
LEADMALE:I just copied the letters and changed "Dearest Harley" to "Dearest Blanche.
OTHERMALE:" Well, you did make a small contribution, Merrill.
LEADFEMALE:Call me Moose
LEADFEMALE:that's my nickname.
OTHERMALE:What a coincidence! That was Dorothy's nickname in elementary school.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, Dorothy? No, I don't.
OTHERMALE:Look, Moose  What? We don't know where Blanche is.
SUPMALE:That's right.
SUPFEMALE:She could be gone for hours.
OTHERFEMALE:Days.
SUPMALE:I mean, it could be weeks before she gets back.
LEADMALE:We're back! Oh, we found some terrific bargains.
LEADFEMALE:Mary, why don't you go try something on and show Dorothy and Sophia.
LEADMALE:Well! Dorothy, you didn't tell me you were expecting company.
LEADFEMALE:This is Merrill.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how are you, Merrill? Merrill! Actually, he's more a friend of Blanche's.
SUPFEMALE:We were just explaining to Merrill that there's no telling when Blanche will be back.
LEADMALE:Oh, Lord, no.
LEADMALE:There's no use waiting around.
LEADMALE:You wouldn't like Blanche anyway.
SUPMALE:She's not your type.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:She isn't.
SUPFEMALE:She's very cold.
LEADMALE:Frigid.
SUPMALE:Hardly likes men at all.
LEADFEMALE:And she's ugly.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't she? "Ugly" is a pretty strong word, Rose.
LEADMALE:And wrinkled.
LEADMALE:Isn't she? She is not wrinkled.
OTHERFEMALE:And fat.
SUPMALE:Stop that! You just stop that right now.
LEADMALE:She is none of those things, Rose Nylund.
LEADMALE:She is gorgeous.
LEADFEMALE:Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous! All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds good.
LEADFEMALE:Tell Blanche I'll be back.
LEADMALE:And stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Stupid, stupid, stupid! Well, I'm off.
SUPMALE:I'll be checking in for messages.
LEADFEMALE:Take care of the house for me.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you gonna go? I'll be staying with my friend Janet.
SUPFEMALE:She said I could spend the night there anytime.
LEADFEMALE:Or was it her husband Ed who said that? I just had a thought.
SUPFEMALE:Congratulations.
SUPFEMALE:Way to go.
LEADMALE:Maybe we should sign Mary up for some natural childbirth classes.
LEADFEMALE:That's not a bad idea.
LEADMALE:I wish I'd known about them when I was pregnant.
LEADMALE:I didn't know what to do, except scream at Stan never to touch me again and call him every name in the book.
LEADFEMALE:Rough labor? Rough conception.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, she doesn't need those classes.
OTHERMALE:I think women ought to have babies the way God intended
SUPFEMALE:strapped to a table, numb from the neck down.
LEADFEMALE:Let me ask a question.
LEADFEMALE:So, how much responsibility are we taking on ourselves here? Oh, Ma, what are you talking about? We can't just abandon her.
SUPFEMALE:The girl needs a roof over her head, guidance, emotional support.
LEADFEMALE:It's not up to us.
LEADMALE:It's up to her father.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I tried talking to him.
OTHERMALE:He won't answer his phone calls or the messages that I leave in his mailbox.
SUPMALE:First he lets his dog eat Ida, now this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm mad as hell! Let's go over there.
SUPFEMALE:No, Ma, Ma, I don't think you should go.
LEADMALE:This is a very sensitive situation, and it's gonna take a little patience and understanding.
LEADFEMALE:That's perfect.
LEADFEMALE:All I have is a little patience and understanding.
LEADMALE:All right, all right.
SUPFEMALE:But when we get there, remember we are trying to make peace.
LEADMALE:So whatever you do, don't bring up Ida.
OTHERFEMALE:I won't
LEADFEMALE:as long as the dog doesn't.
LEADMALE:Hello, Fred.
LEADMALE:Hello, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Petrillo.
SUPMALE:Why haven't you returned my calls? There's nothing to talk about.
LEADFEMALE:We're not going away, Fred.
SUPFEMALE:All right, come in.
OTHERFEMALE:Have a seat.
LEADMALE:Uh excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:Has he eaten? Don't worry.
SUPMALE:He won't hurt you.
OTHERFEMALE:Fred, I think I know how you feel about Mary.
LEADMALE:No, you don't.
LEADMALE:You feel, because Mary went out and got herself pregnant, she's a slut.
SUPFEMALE:Well, let me tell you what a slut is.
LEADFEMALE:It's someone who gets knocked up in the back seat of a Studebaker at a drive-in movie.
OTHERFEMALE:It was a Studebaker, wasn't it, Dorothy? It was a Nash, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Now, that's a slut.
SUPFEMALE:Doggy, I don't know if you noticed, I'm all skin and bones.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I shouldn't say "bones.
SUPMALE:" Now where was I? You were humiliating me.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, right, the slut.
OTHERMALE:And after all she did to me, did I turn her out? You tried, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:But did she go? No.
LEADFEMALE:And look at us today.
LEADMALE:No one could love a daughter more.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Ma.
SUPMALE:So what if I don't respect her.
SUPFEMALE:You've got a lot of nerve coming in here telling me how to raise my daughter.
SUPMALE:You have no idea what I'm going through.
LEADFEMALE:I gotta get outta here.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about the dog.
OTHERFEMALE:He's just playing.
LEADMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:What did you do with Ida?  Samson.
LEADFEMALE:Fred, what Ma was trying to say is that you can't just throw Mary out.
SUPMALE:I didn't throw her out.
LEADFEMALE:She walked out.
SUPFEMALE:That's not how Mary tells it.
LEADFEMALE:We got into a fight.
OTHERFEMALE:Who remembers who said what? That's not the point.
OTHERFEMALE:Fred, I remember how scared I felt when I found out I was pregnant.
SUPFEMALE:And you know what my biggest fear was? That my father would hate me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, God, was he angry
SUPMALE:and was I scared.
LEADFEMALE:It was a long time before he'd accept the situation, and, Fred, until he did, I only had one parent.
LEADMALE:Right now, Mary doesn't have any parents.
LEADFEMALE:You talk like I did something wrong.
LEADMALE:What can I say that'll make you understand? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Maybe I'm too stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Fine, then maybe there is something I can say.
SUPFEMALE:And I want to apologize for this story before I begin.
LEADFEMALE:Have you ever heard of a little town called St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf? No.
LEADFEMALE:Perfect.
SUPFEMALE:Now, as it was told to me
LEADMALE:and I have to admit that I wasn't listening that closely
LEADMALE:there was this farmer named Nils Nibelung, and he had a pig named Brunhilde, and she won all the blue ribbons at all the county fairs.
OTHERMALE:Well, Nils also had a daughter named Fricka, and she won red ribbons
OTHERMALE:usually as runner-up to the pig.
LEADMALE:Does this story have a point? You asked that at just the right time.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, one April, Nils decided to breed Brunhilde
LEADFEMALE:that's the pig, not the daughter
LEADFEMALE:and he chose April because that's when pigs are at their most beautiful and desirable.
LEADMALE:Unfortunately, so was Fricka.
OTHERFEMALE:So while Brunhilde and the pig were doing their thing, Fricka and the local pig breeder were doing theirs.
LEADMALE:God, I hope I got the names right.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, when Nils heard about it, he banished Fricka from his house and his life forever.
LEADMALE:So? So after a while he lost interest in the pig's company and he ate her.
SUPMALE:And he died St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf's loneliest man.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that the end of the story? God, I hope so.
LEADFEMALE:I don't get it.
LEADFEMALE:Fred, let me put it this way.
SUPFEMALE:She is 16, she's scared, and she's carrying your grandchild.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you really want to abandon her? Anybody home? Oh, I thought you were gonna spend the night at Janet's.
LEADFEMALE:On the way over there, I got to thinking, is there really any reason for me to be running away from Merrill? I mean, the man has paid his debt to society, hasn't he? After all, is there any man on earth I can't handle? Well, I got nowhere with Fred.
SUPFEMALE:And Ma was no help
SUPFEMALE:there is no way to control her mouth.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God!  What happened? What's the matter? Who did this to you? The Sandinistas.
LEADFEMALE:Why would they do this? Because I knew too much.
LEADMALE:Merrill did this about an hour ago.
LEADFEMALE:Merrill? Ma, are you all right? What did Merrill do? He came looking for Blanche.
SUPMALE:I held out as long as I could.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God! How did he make you talk? I think it was the white wine.
LEADMALE:I finally told him she was Blanche and she didn't want anything to do with him.
SUPFEMALE:What did he say? He said he wanted to have something to remember you by.
LEADFEMALE:So he took the silver.
LEADMALE:Oh! At least it's some consolation that he couldn't possibly find the secret place where I hide my jewelry.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Did I mention there was wine and music?  I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? Merrill! My God! Where are you? Jail? Well, they only allow you one phone call, and you called me? What? I'm wearing a green silk pant suit.
SUPFEMALE:Underneath? Well Oh, give me that!  Fred! Hi, I thought I'd stop by since I was in the neighborhood.
OTHERFEMALE:Fred, you live in the neighborhood.
OTHERFEMALE:Right, Well, I wanted to come by and see Mary.
LEADMALE:Hi, Daddy.
LEADMALE:How're you doing? I'm doing OK.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Mary, I've been talking to Dorothy, and she really made sense.
SUPMALE:It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you just come home and we'll work it out? Sounds good.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, guys, for everything.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you be a stranger now.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:I'll come back tomorrow and get the rest of my stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Let us know how you're doing.
LEADMALE:Don't forget, Tuesday we have mime class.
LEADFEMALE:Mime class? The Lamaze class was all filled up.
SUPMALE:Well, we'll see you soon.
LEADFEMALE:And, Dorothy, thanks for all your help.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe we can get together soon and you can tell me all about that St.
LEADMALE:Olaf.
LEADMALE:Sounds like a good place to raise a daughter.
SUPFEMALE:I was desperate! 
SUPFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, by any chance, did you borrow my pearl-handled six-shooter? Blanche, you look ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I do not.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm a cowgirl.
LEADMALE:Yippee-aye-oh K-Y.
SUPMALE:Ki-yay.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, whatever.
LEADMALE:Have you seen my gun? No.
OTHERFEMALE:Damn! Why wear this if I've got nothing to put in it? I say the same thing every morning when I put on my bra.
SUPMALE:Blanche, why are you dressed like that? Because I am going to an authentic Texas-style barbecue, and my date is a real-life cowboy.
SUPMALE:Morty Fishbein is a real-life cowboy? He's from Amarillo, Texas.
LEADFEMALE:He was the grand marshal of the B'nai B'rith rodeo for three years straight.
LEADFEMALE:Who better to go with to a barbecue?  Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Morty.
SUPFEMALE:Threw your back out putting your boots on? You're in traction? Oh, I guess this means you're gonna be a little late? Oh, all right.
SUPMALE:Well, can you believe that? Because of one little slipped disc, Morty is not taking me to the barbecue.
LEADMALE:What a shame.
SUPFEMALE:You'll miss the foot-stomping version of "Sunrise, Sunset.
LEADMALE:" You know, this kind of thing has been happening to me a lot lately.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's because I'm going out with men who are too old for me.
LEADFEMALE:In the last year my average date has been over 60, bald, covered in liver spots and wears a truss.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds good to me.
OTHERFEMALE:I used to attract men who were young and active and virile, but now they just want to date girls in their 20s and 30s.
LEADFEMALE:What's a great-looking gal in her 40s to do? Perhaps we should find one and ask her.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, Blanche.
LEADMALE:This is all your own fault.
OTHERMALE:I mean, take Steven.
LEADFEMALE:You'd been dating him for six weeks.
LEADMALE:The moment it looked like you were making a commitment, you dumped him.
SUPMALE:It's like six weeks is your cutoff point.
LEADMALE:It is not.
SUPMALE:It is too.
LEADMALE:You were getting along great, you liked each other, you had a wonderful time together.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to talk about it.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, Steven didn't have all the qualities I look for in a man.
OTHERMALE:Hi, girls.
OTHERMALE:What a great day.
LEADMALE:I feel so terrific.
SUPFEMALE:It's like life is a giant weenie roast and I'm the biggest weenie.
OTHERFEMALE:No argument from this corner.
LEADMALE:Rose, you're even more relentlessly cheerful than usual.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:It's because I've joined this group.
SUPMALE:They teach you positive thinking to bring health, success and love into your life.
OTHERMALE:There's a meeting tonight.
LEADMALE:Wanna come? Oh, Rose, come on.
LEADMALE:Forget it.
SUPFEMALE:This is just a fad.
LEADMALE:This is for gullible people who believe in magic.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, you're not very open-minded.
SUPMALE:I am so.
LEADMALE:Now shut up.
LEADMALE:That's exactly what I'm talking about.
OTHERFEMALE:You should listen to yourself sometime.
LEADFEMALE:What are you afraid of? I'm not afraid of anything.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you come to the meeting? Maybe you'll find something to make your life better.
OTHERMALE:Oh, all right.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, if it'll make you happy, I'll go.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, me too.
LEADMALE:You won't regret it.
LEADFEMALE:How about you, Sophia? Remember, today is the first day of the rest of your life.
LEADMALE:Terrific.
OTHERMALE:If I'm lucky, I may live to be seven.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, girls.
LEADMALE:You're just in time.
SUPMALE:Where's Blanche? She said to save her a seat.
OTHERMALE:She saw a man smiling at her out in the hall.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody's smiling here.
LEADMALE:I haven't seen so many goofy smiles since the great denture swap at Shady Pines.
SUPMALE:Welcome to Create Your Own Miracles.
OTHERFEMALE:My name is Mary Ellen.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mary Ellen.
LEADFEMALE:You're special.
LEADFEMALE:You're special too, and do you know why? Because you're you, and there is nobody else like you in the whole world.
LEADFEMALE:Do you understand that? Only an idiot wouldn't understand that.
LEADFEMALE:Mary Ellen, I'm completely lost.
SUPFEMALE:Could you run that by me again? After the lecture, Rose.
SUPMALE:Just like last week.
LEADFEMALE:Now, are there any newcomers here tonight? Right over here.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, no.
SUPMALE:Oh, please, stand up and introduce yourself.
LEADMALE:I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
LEADMALE:I'm Melanie Griffith.
LEADMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:Hi, Melanie.
SUPFEMALE:You're special.
LEADMALE:You're nuts.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, we're not newcomers.
SUPMALE:We're just observing.
SUPMALE:You must have a fear of committing.
LEADMALE:She had no problem committing me.
SUPMALE:Look, joining a group, particularly a group like this, just isn't my thing.
LEADFEMALE:I see.
LEADMALE:So, your thing is sitting on the sidelines and playing the cynic, bursting a child's balloon so he'll learn about the harshness of life early, pointing out what's wrong with the world rather than what's right about it.
OTHERMALE:That sounds good.
LEADMALE:Where can we sign up for that group? Dorothy, you're a very negative person.
OTHERFEMALE:People are given these messages very early in life, usually by their parents.
LEADFEMALE:In your case, my guess is the mother.
SUPFEMALE:Guess again, oh, special one.
LEADMALE:Is it my fault she got knocked up at 19, married a loser Look, to me, this is all a big show.
OTHERFEMALE:I am sure that under all these smiles, you people have to be aware that life can be pretty miserable sometimes.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Melanie.
SUPMALE:I am sorry you feel that way, but at least be open enough to hear what we have to say.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
OTHERMALE:I think everybody really likes you, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Everyone is beautiful on the inside I cannot believe this.
LEADMALE:I have a great guy like Steven just crazy about me, and I'm wasting my time here with these grinning idiots.
LEADMALE:Let's go home.
SUPFEMALE:We said we'd stay till after the meeting.
LEADFEMALE:Just a word of caution
LEADFEMALE:don't doze off.
LEADFEMALE:I think that's when the pods take over your body.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, I hate to admit it, but there may be something to Rose's positive-thinking course.
LEADMALE:Last night I decided to write down all the negative thoughts that come into my head, and Ma, I cannot believe how many there are.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, just listen to this, right here on page 187
LEADFEMALE:"The faucet is dripping.
SUPFEMALE:"I know it's gonna keep me up all night.
LEADMALE:"Then I'll be tired for my crummy job tomorrow.
SUPMALE:Life is a swirling eddy of despair.
SUPFEMALE:" I mean, I can't believe that something as insignificant as a leaky faucet could bring all these bad thoughts about myself.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a very serious thing, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Ma, what can I do about it? Try changing the washer.
SUPMALE:Ma, I'm talking about my negative thinking.
OTHERMALE:I know what you're talking about.
LEADMALE:Remember what your cousin Frederico used to 
LEADFEMALE:"People waste their time pondering whether a glass is half empty or half full.
OTHERFEMALE:Me, I just drink whatever's in the glass.
LEADMALE:" Ma, Cousin Frederico was a hopeless alcoholic who played boccie ball with an imaginary friend named Little Luigi.
LEADFEMALE:Kind of puts that dripping faucet in perspective, doesn't it? Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Steven, nice to see you again.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, it's nice to see you.
LEADMALE:Do you mind if I get a drink? I must have sweat off ten pounds today.
LEADMALE:You played a lot of tennis? Tennis, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, right.
SUPFEMALE:Just help yourself to whatever's in the fridge.
LEADFEMALE:It's nice that you two have worked out your differences.
LEADFEMALE:I think the problem with him before was that he was on the rebound from Karen, but now that he's gotten over her, he's all mine, and I think we appreciate each other more.
LEADFEMALE:Everything old and familiar has become new and exciting.
LEADFEMALE:That's nice.
LEADMALE:Maybe I should look up one of my old flames.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but not Stan.
SUPFEMALE:The other one.
OTHERFEMALE:I have some incredible news! You've been traded to the Rams? Do you know that nasty butcher down at the deli? The little guy with four fingers? That's him.
SUPMALE:I don't know, but every time I order roast beef, he cheats me.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know how he does it.
OTHERMALE:I stand and watch as he slices a big, juicy roast beef, but when I get home, I find these crummy, little, hard pieces, you know, from the end? Anyway, today I went in with a positive attitude.
LEADMALE:I told myself, "This man is my friend and I know he is going to give me a good cut of meat.
LEADFEMALE:" Look.
LEADMALE:It's a miracle! Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Pilgrims are gonna be showing up to kiss Dorothy's luncheon meat.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, I know it doesn't mean much to you, but I acted positively and things are improving in my life.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, now I feel that I have the power to make anything happen.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, is it beautiful out there today.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, do you think I'm dressed OK for the dog races? That depends.
LEADMALE:Are you competing? Sophia, nothing you can say is gonna bother me, and you know why? 'Cause when I'm with Steven, I don't know, I get goose bumps, I feel all tingly.
LEADMALE:Oh, I understand what you're talking about.
LEADFEMALE:I feel the same way when I hear the words, "And filling in for Doc, Tommy Newsom.
SUPFEMALE:"  This is terrific! Terrific! Blanche took a positive step and positive things are happening in her life.
LEADMALE:Maybe it'll work for me.
LEADMALE:You know what I'll try to get? A man who is open, caring, honest, who has eyes only for me.
LEADFEMALE:Pussycat, you got your roast beef.
LEADMALE:Don't push it.
LEADFEMALE:That was the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:Steven's had a heart attack.
LEADFEMALE:You want me to drive you to the hospital? No.
LEADMALE:I'm not sure that it's a good idea for you to drive yourself.
SUPMALE:I'm not sure that I'm gonna go.
LEADMALE:What do you mean, you're not sure you're going? Oh, I just have some other things I have to do.
SUPMALE:If something bad happened to somebody I care about, I'd be over in a shot.
OTHERMALE:Well, I do care about him.
LEADMALE:I just have some things I have to do.
LEADFEMALE:Like what? Look.
LEADMALE:I'm trying to keep this relationship casual.
LEADFEMALE:If I go to that hospital, I'm in and there's no getting out.
LEADMALE:Don't be silly.
LEADFEMALE:All you do is follow the orange line down the middle of the hallways.
SUPMALE:They lead right to the elevators.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I don't think it's a good idea to hook up with a 60-year-old man with a bad heart.
LEADMALE:What guarantee do I have we'll have any kind of future together? Blanche, in life there are no guarantees.
LEADFEMALE:There are choices.
LEADMALE:Well, then, my choice is either to play it safe or to take a risk.
LEADMALE:I wish I knew what to do.
SUPFEMALE:All right, all right.
SUPFEMALE:I can pick up a cue.
SUPFEMALE:Picture it.
OTHERFEMALE:Sicily, 1912.
LEADMALE:A beautiful, young peasant girl with clear, olive skin meets an exciting but penniless Spanish artist.
LEADFEMALE:There's an instant attraction.
SUPFEMALE:They laugh, they sing.
OTHERFEMALE:They slam down a few boilermakers.
SUPMALE:Shortly afterwards, he's arrested for showing her how he can hold his palette without using his hands.
LEADFEMALE:But I digress.
LEADFEMALE:He paints her portrait and they make passionate love.
OTHERMALE:She spends much of the next day in the shower with a loofah sponge, scrubbing his fingerprints off her body.
SUPMALE:She sees the portrait and is insulted.
LEADMALE:It looks nothing like her.
SUPFEMALE:And she storms out of his life forever.
SUPMALE:That peasant girl was me and that painter was Pablo Picasso.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, I have a feeling you're lying.
LEADMALE:Be positive, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:OK, I'm positive you're lying.
LEADFEMALE:It doesn't make any difference, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:I know what I have to do.
LEADFEMALE:In this case, I'm gonna put me first.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, now, there's a radical shift in priorities.
LEADMALE:Look, I just don't feel like making this kind of emotional investment.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche You don't understand.
LEADMALE:I lost one man I loved when George died.
LEADMALE:I just won't do it again.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:How was your day? Rose, I tried to be positive, but it was lousy.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, in times like these, you have to hold onto your faith, just like Hans Gluckenflunken, St.
LEADMALE:Olaf's greatest explorer.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, please, let me have a little recovery time before you start a St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf story.
LEADMALE:You see, Hans Gluckenflunken set out for Florida to find the Fountain of Intelligence.
LEADFEMALE:Unfortunately, when he got to Duluth, he took a left instead of a right and he wound up back in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf.
LEADMALE:That's how he got his nickname, Wrong Way Gluckenflunken.
SUPMALE:Rose, how is this a story about faith? Well, when he got back, it was the dead of winter.
LEADMALE:Tired and hungry and but still clinging to his belief that he would find the Fountain of Intelligence, he saw the miracle water trickling out of the ground, and he fell to his knees and tasted it.
LEADFEMALE:Unfortunately, it was a broken sewer main.
LEADMALE:Two days later, he died of cholera.
LEADMALE:What is the point, Rose? He was positive he had found the Fountain of Intelligence.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, his dying words were, "I think I've learned something from this.
LEADMALE:" Girls Am I interrupting? I sincerely hope so.
LEADMALE:I thought you had a date.
LEADMALE:Oh, I cancelled.
LEADMALE:He was just a nice man with a big boat who wanted to go to Bimini.
LEADMALE:That sounds like hell.
SUPMALE:I don't know, I'm just not ready to start up something with someone new.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's because you miss Steven.
OTHERMALE:Uh-huh, a lot.
SUPMALE:Why don't you go to the hospital? Because when he got sick it scared the hell out of me.
LEADFEMALE:And you did what you always do
SUPMALE:you ran.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, it's time to stop running.
SUPFEMALE:You really think so? Absolutely.
LEADMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:I will.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, you always give me the best advice about men.
SUPFEMALE:Who says wisdom comes from experience? Oh, my God, what's happened? Is he all right? He'll be OK.
SUPFEMALE:I just hate seeing him like this.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Are you a relative? I'm his wife.
SUPFEMALE:His wife? He told me his wife died years ago.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Oh, he did, did he? You louse! You crumb! This is who you're cheating with now? A woman in her 60s? We're through.
SUPFEMALE:You'll be hearing from my attorney.
SUPFEMALE:He's all yours.
LEADFEMALE:Enjoy.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not Steven!  I'm over here, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:Oh!  Sorry about that.
LEADFEMALE:Hi! Hi, Blanche.
SUPMALE:How are you? Oh, never mind me.
SUPMALE:How about you? Coming along.
OTHERFEMALE:The doctor told me to keep my life nice and dull.
LEADFEMALE:No more excitement for a while.
SUPMALE:By the way, thanks for the flowers.
SUPMALE:It was the least I could do.
LEADMALE:I thought so too.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Steven, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:There's no excuse for my not being here, but the important thing is I'm back.
SUPMALE:Blanche Wait, honey, let me finish.
OTHERFEMALE:I know how much we care for each other, I know how good we are for each other, and, let's face it, nobody has more fun with each other than we do.
LEADFEMALE:You remember that night on the beach, when I pretended my hand was a big old sand crab crawling up your thigh? We wrapped ourselves up in that blanket, and you about jumped out of your skin when I showed you that Savannah twister.
LEADMALE:You remember that?  Are you all right, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Gordon? Yes, I'm fine.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:It won't happen again.
LEADFEMALE:At least not until you're out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche Karen and I are back together.
LEADMALE:Karen? Well, I thought you said it was all over between you two.
LEADFEMALE:I thought it was, but she came to the hospital as soon as she heard.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:So you're gonna let one little gesture of goodwill end our relationship? Well, she was here when I needed someone the most.
LEADFEMALE:And I realized how much we still mean to each other.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm very happy for you.
SUPFEMALE:No, I'm not.
LEADFEMALE:I'm mad at me.
LEADMALE:Damn! Ever since my husband died I think, "If I don't leave, I'm gonna get left.
SUPMALE:" It looks like either way, I end up alone.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Not half as sorry as I am.
LEADFEMALE:Do I feel stupid.
SUPFEMALE:You shouldn't.
LEADMALE:You're a terrific lady.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna miss you.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you forget me, now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't worry.
LEADMALE:I'll always have this printout to remember you by.
LEADMALE:You want me to drive tonight, Dorothy? Oh, Rose, listen.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not going to the meeting tonight.
LEADFEMALE:How come? I'm not comfortable there.
SUPMALE:I'm not comfortable with the people.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not comfortable with the whole thing.
LEADFEMALE:But you need the group's support, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:It's not a good idea to go it alone.
SUPFEMALE:Did I ever tell you about my cousin Vigdor Fricken? He tried to go it alone in a three-legged race.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you know what happened to him? Please, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to hear about your frickin' cousin.
LEADMALE:Well, fine.
SUPFEMALE:Then if you're not gonna go, I'm gonna stay home too.
LEADMALE:How come? I've seen you at those meetings, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:You tried to change, but you couldn't.
SUPMALE:If I keep going there, I'm gonna drive you crazy.
LEADMALE:Well, Rose, I don't want you to stop doing something you believe in.
LEADFEMALE:I've gotten all I'm gonna get out of it.
LEADMALE:Besides, I'd rather be part of this group than that one.
SUPMALE:I hate to say this, but Rose, you're special.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:I could never get them to say that to me at those meetings.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, is everything all right? Steven's back with his old girlfriend.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Are you OK? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm fine.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I learned a little bit about missed opportunities and how sometimes you have to take chances.
OTHERFEMALE:But all is not lost.
LEADFEMALE:I met a new man in the next bed.
SUPFEMALE:He's recently broken up with his wife, and the good news is he has the heart of a 25-year-old.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, that's great.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:As long as his body doesn't reject it.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, do we know anybody named Cecilia? Your cousin, Ma.
SUPMALE:She only has weeks to live.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Next time I'll accept the charges.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? No.
LEADMALE:No, we don't have a car for sale.
SUPMALE:You must have the wrong number.
SUPMALE:Is it a man or a woman? A woman, interested in a Mercedes Mm-hm.
SUPMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Sorry, the car's been sold.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Blanche, what is this all about? I have figured out the most wonderful way to meet men.
LEADFEMALE:Rich, eligible men.
SUPMALE:I put an ad in the paper saying I have a Mercedes for sale for a very low price.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have a Mercedes.
LEADMALE:But I'm renting one and pretending it's for sale.
LEADMALE:All day tomorrow, men are gonna be showing up here for a test drive.
LEADFEMALE:You can tell a lot about a man by how he drives.
SUPFEMALE:You know, that's true.
OTHERMALE:Sometimes Stan couldn't even get the key in the ignition.
LEADFEMALE:Hi! Hi, everybody.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Miles.
LEADFEMALE:How was your evening? It was terrific.
SUPFEMALE:We saw a marvelous production of The Glass Menagerie.
LEADMALE:That is one of my favorite plays.
SUPMALE:Frankly, I was a little disappointed.
SUPFEMALE:Really? When you told me you were taking me to a revival of Tennessee Williams, I was expecting something more along the lines of a sÃ©ance.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, I have never met anyone like you.
LEADFEMALE:Check the cornfield on Hee Haw.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, why don't we go, so that Rose and Miles can be alone? Why? We were here first.
LEADMALE:Ma, isn't it time for your medication? Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:I thought my buzz was wearing off.
SUPFEMALE:I really did have a good time tonight.
LEADFEMALE:And don't forget, I'm taking you out tomorrow for your birthday
LEADMALE:my treat.
LEADMALE:Oh, no! Rose, I forgot to tell you.
SUPFEMALE:My daughter Caroline is flying in for my birthday.
OTHERMALE:Maybe we could all go out to lunch.
LEADMALE:I'm very anxious for you two to get together.
SUPMALE:Why don't you two come here for lunch? I'll cook something special.
LEADMALE:That's a great idea.
SUPMALE:I loved what you made the last time.
SUPFEMALE:What was it called
LEADFEMALE:gerkinflunken? Oh, no, that was my uncle.
LEADMALE:The owner of St.
SUPMALE:Olaf's most famous haberdashery.
SUPFEMALE:He came up with the slogan, "You don't have to be Amish to look Amish.
LEADMALE:" Gosh, I wish I could afford something pretty like this for my potential car buyers, but I'm having those end-of-the-month money problems.
LEADMALE:Looking for a loan? You've come to the right place.
LEADFEMALE:Why, Sophia! How'd you get your hands on that kind of money? I'm a graverobber.
LEADMALE:What's it to you? Morning, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, Ma.
LEADMALE:Sleep well? No.
OTHERMALE:I had that recurring nightmare
LEADMALE:the one where I'm in bed with Warren Beatty and he says, "Sorry, this is too sick even for me.
SUPFEMALE:" Do we have the ingredients for kerflugenglugen? Come on, Rose, get with it.
LEADFEMALE:Do what the rest of us do
SUPFEMALE:buy frozen kerflugenglugen.
SUPMALE:Oh, I could never serve store-bought candied herring.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, I have my own special recipe.
LEADFEMALE:I use red-hots for the eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Kill her! Kill her now!  I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? Well, you are aware that it's a two-seater? It's not much of a family car.
LEADMALE:Oh?! How long have you and your wife been practically separated? Well, you might as well come over for a look.
LEADFEMALE:How about, say, 12:20? Oh, good.
LEADMALE:Well, I can't wait for you to get your hands on it either! Goodbye.
SUPMALE:You're not having company? I want everything to go smoothly for Miles and Caroline.
LEADFEMALE:It's a big step, meeting a man's family.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:Men will be over, but they'll be in and out.
LEADFEMALE:Don't say it, Ma.
LEADMALE:I have to.
OTHERFEMALE:At my age, when you don't say it, it can back up on you and come out some other way.
OTHERFEMALE:My first appointment's here, right on time.
LEADFEMALE:I've been out there watching him.
OTHERFEMALE:He's been looking at the car and smiling.
OTHERFEMALE:I feel just like a fisherman with a new lure.
LEADMALE:You catch 'em, you clean 'em! Blanche, aren't you embarrassed, going through all this subterfuge to get a man? A man? I'm planning on getting a six-month supply!  Oh, hi.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche? James.
LEADMALE:I'm here about the car.
LEADFEMALE:Miles? No, honey, it's James.
SUPMALE:You stay right there and I'll get the keys.
LEADFEMALE:How much mileage has she got on her? Let's just say she's been around the block.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go, James.
SUPMALE:Let's put the pedal to the metal.
LEADMALE:I can't believe anything that beautiful is so cheap.
SUPMALE:I'm cramping up! Miles? No, it wasn't Miles.
OTHERMALE:We'll let you know when he gets here.
OTHERMALE:Maybe we need a signal.
LEADFEMALE:How about this
SUPMALE:I yell, "Hey, Rose, Miles is here"? Got it.
OTHERMALE:Miles? Rose! You might have forgotten the signal.
LEADMALE:I know I did.
SUPMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Delivery for a Sophia Petrillo.
SUPFEMALE:Here's a president you've never seen.
LEADMALE:Look what I got, Dorothy
LEADFEMALE:a surprise for you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, look at these watches! They must have cost you a fortune.
SUPMALE:They did.
LEADFEMALE:Where'd you get the money? Is that what you say to someone who bought you a gift? Ma, I asked you a question.
SUPMALE:I never told you this, Dorothy, but I'm a special friend of Phil Rizzuto.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, ladies.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, Miles.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to meet my daughter Caroline.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:It's so nice to meet you.
SUPMALE:This is Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, Miles is here! Rose, Miles is here! Who? Hello, Rose! Miles? Rose, this is Caroline.
LEADMALE:Caroline, Rose Nylund.
OTHERMALE:How do you do? I am so glad to finally meet you.
OTHERMALE:Lunch is all set up out on the lanai.
SUPMALE:Your father says you're a classical musician.
LEADMALE:What do you play? The English horn.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know horns had nationalities.
SUPFEMALE:But I guess it makes sense.
LEADFEMALE:If jumping beans can be Mexican and fire drills can be Chinese and flies can be Spanish  Hi, I'm here about the car.
LEADFEMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:Have a seat.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:How're you doing? Blanche is out on a test drive.
LEADMALE:Blanche said I was gonna be the first.
LEADMALE:She's been using that line for 40 years.
LEADFEMALE:That was fun, James.
LEADMALE:We ought to get together again sometime.
SUPMALE:I'd like to talk to you about buying the car.
LEADMALE:Not now.
SUPMALE:I'll get backed up on my appointments.
LEADFEMALE:Are you Thomas? I am, here for my test drive.
LEADFEMALE:You don't even have to show him the car.
LEADFEMALE:I'll write you a check.
OTHERMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:At this price, I know I want the car.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm writing out a $5,000 deposit now.
LEADMALE:No, I can't do that.
SUPFEMALE:The banks are closed.
SUPMALE:I can't be sure it's any good.
LEADMALE:You've got an honest face.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll cash that check right here.
OTHERMALE:Ma, can I see you in the kitchen? I've got no secrets from these people.
OTHERMALE:Shady Pines, Ma.
SUPMALE:Right behind you.
LEADMALE:I think you should take my check Ma, I wanna know, where did you get the money? The government has been kinder and gentler by sending me more social security checks than they used to.
LEADMALE:The computer made a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, that money doesn't belong to you.
LEADFEMALE:How much are we talking about? Enough to have you rubbed out if you rat on me.
LEADFEMALE:Ma! So far, 170 grand.
LEADFEMALE:But I haven't checked today's mail.
LEADFEMALE:It was awfully sweet of you to go to all this trouble, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:This is, uh delicious.
OTHERMALE:Mm, even the eyes.
LEADMALE:Have you tried those eyes?  Oh, no! You ate the tail before we had a chance to make a wish.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:I couldn't help myself
LEADFEMALE:it was all so delicious.
LEADFEMALE:You certainly know the way to a man's heart.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just take these in.
LEADFEMALE:I'll help you.
LEADMALE:Who wants birthday cake? What's in it? It's a secret.
OTHERMALE:And in some countries, a vaccine.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I'll give you $20,000 and free root canal work.
LEADMALE:You're a dentist! I'll tell you what, I'll give you $25,000 and free root canal work.
SUPFEMALE:You're a dentist, too! No, but I really want this car.
LEADFEMALE:Mail call! Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
SUPFEMALE:See ya.
OTHERMALE:These are all checks from the government? No, there's also an application for a gold card.
SUPMALE:Boy, word gets around fast! I am so happy I finally got the chance to meet you.
LEADMALE:I'm happy, too.
LEADMALE:Rose I've a feeling you and I are gonna be the best of friends.
OTHERMALE:There's something we need to talk about.
SUPMALE:It's about you and Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:I know it seems like a crazy match
OTHERMALE:a college professor and a farmer's daughter
OTHERMALE:but somehow what we have together seems to work.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, it's only been a year since my mother died.
OTHERFEMALE:Daddy's still very vulnerable at this point.
LEADFEMALE:I can understand why he reached out for you
LEADFEMALE:you're very warm and very giving.
OTHERFEMALE:But he needs time.
LEADFEMALE:So, please, if you really care for my father, the best thing you can do is stay away from him.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God, Rose! Now I've got three excited men out there
LEADMALE:and for the first time in my life it seems like too many.
LEADFEMALE:Your 1:30 appointment just got here, and I think he's interested.
LEADFEMALE:Not another one! What am I gonna do? Didn't you think this thing through? Didn't you think they'd want to buy the car? No! I assumed once they saw me, they'd forget all about the car.
SUPMALE:Well, I'd better do something to get their minds off that car.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't I offer 'em some cake? That's Miles' birthday cake.
OTHERMALE:He'll have other birthdays.
SUPFEMALE:But not with me.
SUPMALE:Why? What's wrong? Caroline told me to stay away from Miles 'cause it's only a year since his wife died.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Rose, that's terrible.
LEADMALE:Well, don't give her any cake.
LEADMALE:Rose, those are Caroline's feelings, not Miles'
SUPFEMALE:otherwise, why would he be here? I was trying so hard to impress her.
SUPFEMALE:I remember when we had to impress a man's parents, not his children.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, Mother Devereaux was dead set against me marrying George.
OTHERFEMALE:She wanted her little boy to marry a virgin.
LEADFEMALE:Hm! How did she know you weren't? Maybe it was all those "Honk if you've had Blanche" bumper stickers.
LEADFEMALE:Oh!  I wish I knew what to do.
SUPMALE:I could settle that thing with Miles in one minute.
LEADMALE:I can handle men one at a time.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, could you really do something? Sure I could.
LEADMALE:If Dorothy will take care of that mess out in the living room.
LEADFEMALE:Now, just a minute.
SUPFEMALE:I have my own problems.
LEADMALE:I'm dealing with a mother who stole money from the government.
LEADMALE:Come on! It's not like I'm an elected official.
SUPMALE:Turn her in, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:But first, go out there and take care of those men.
SUPMALE:I have to take care of my mother.
LEADMALE:I can't take care of both Miles and the men.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, please do this for Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:For me.
OTHERMALE:Oh, all right.
LEADMALE:I don't want my plan to go to waste.
LEADFEMALE:I still intend to date James and Thomas, so let them down easy.
LEADFEMALE:Frank and Eddie, flush 'em.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose, don't be so upset.
SUPMALE:Have you seen the way Miles looks when you tell those St.
LEADMALE:Olaf stories? He looks like he's listening.
OTHERMALE:There you go!  Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, did you happen to see a little old lady go by? The one who said, "What are you staring at? I can buy you and sell you"? Went that way.
OTHERMALE:Ma? Now, look, Ma, we have to talk about the money.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:Your sister and brother don't have to know anything about this.
SUPMALE:I want you to promise that you'll send this money back to the government.
LEADFEMALE:They're not good with money
OTHERFEMALE:they can't handle it.
LEADMALE:They spent $400 for a toilet seat! You know, Ma, I'm really surprised at you.
SUPFEMALE:When I was a little girl, you told me how much it meant to you when you came here to America for the first time.
LEADFEMALE:Do you remember what you thought of when you first saw the Statue of Liberty holding up her torch of freedom? I was amazed.
LEADFEMALE:You see? I was amazed that women in this country shaved under their arms.
LEADMALE:Ma, you told me how much America meant to you, how wonderful America was, how nice it is to be in a country that doesn't care about soccer.
SUPFEMALE:That money belongs to America.
LEADMALE:Ma, you have America's money and you have to give it back.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, please You taught me to love this country.
OTHERFEMALE:You were the first one to make me feel proud of being an American.
LEADFEMALE:You were the first one who put an American flag in my hand.
LEADMALE:Ma, why don't you take a moment and think what America has given you? Besides this 170 grand? All right.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right, I'll send it back.
LEADMALE:All of it? Yes, Ma, all of it.
LEADFEMALE:OK, OK.
LEADMALE:I just hope they want it back after an 83-year-old woman rolled around in it naked.
SUPMALE:Well, how was lunch? I don't know how the woman does it.
SUPMALE:The herring was not only delicious, but it looked happy!  Well, Caroline.
LEADFEMALE:Did you tell your daddy about your little talk with Rose? Not yet.
LEADMALE:What did I miss? I think he has a right to know.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh told Rose the truth, Daddy.
LEADMALE:It's too soon for you to have a relationship.
OTHERFEMALE:You what?! Now wait.
LEADFEMALE:Could I say something? You think your daddy has become involved too soon after your poor mother's demise, but, honey, a year is more than respectable.
LEADFEMALE:Why, I've had men call me when their wives were in intensive care.
LEADFEMALE:Granted, these men were not pillars of the community.
SUPFEMALE:Well, he is not ready.
SUPFEMALE:Caroline! Caroline, your mother and I were married for 43 years.
SUPMALE:They were wonderful years.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't think I'd find someone I'd care about again, but this happens when it happens
LEADMALE:I've got a second chance.
LEADFEMALE:I think it would be nice if you'd be happy for me.
OTHERFEMALE:How could he do this? He has needs, honey.
LEADMALE:All men have needs.
OTHERMALE:And there are women out there who will to stoop to any means to prey on those needs
LEADFEMALE:including false advertising.
OTHERFEMALE:I know, 'cause I've met 'em.
LEADFEMALE:You just thank your lucky stars Rose Nylund is not one of those women.
LEADFEMALE:I never looked at it that way.
LEADMALE:Besides, after you get to know Rose, why, you'll you'll Oh, why spoil the surprise?  Gentlemen, please! You don't seem to understand what I'm trying to tell you
LEADFEMALE:the car is not for sale! Why not? It's haunted.
SUPFEMALE:Haunted? What? The car is haunted.
LEADMALE:I should know, I rode in it.
LEADMALE:You look OK.
SUPMALE:I'm 27 years old.
LEADFEMALE:We're not getting anywhere.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche wants James and Thomas.
SUPFEMALE:I'll try to save them.
LEADFEMALE:You go over there with Frick and Frack and try to ditch 'em.
SUPMALE:You want me to offend them? Pretend they're family.
SUPFEMALE:Look, everybody named after an apostle, come with me.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, there was no Eddie.
LEADMALE:Have you guys ever heard of Totally Hidden Video? Underneath this gray wig is comedian Kaye Ballard.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks for being on our show.
SUPFEMALE:So that's the story.
LEADMALE:The car is not available, but Blanche Devereaux is.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe that I've been hustled! Boy, if I wasn't a teacher and accustomed to abuse, I'd leave too! Really? You know, I'm a teacher myself.
LEADMALE:No kidding? Say, um why don't you tell me about this automobile thing again? Say tonight, over dinner? Oh, now, Blanche Devereaux is a very charming, attractive woman.
LEADFEMALE:She is.
OTHERFEMALE:Shall I pick you up around 7:30? I feel terrible about this.
LEADMALE:Let's say 8:00.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:Take her someplace decent.
LEADMALE:Look, Rose, I made it perfectly clear to Caroline how I feel about you.
OTHERMALE:Maybe Caroline is right.
LEADMALE:Your wife died such a little while ago.
OTHERMALE:Maybe I am taking advantage of your vulnerability.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, you're a smart woman.
LEADMALE:Oh, you are vulnerable! Of course I am.
LEADMALE:I'm drawn to your beauty, your charm, your unique brand of wisdom.
LEADMALE:What about Caroline? Oh! Caroline doesn't know everything.
LEADMALE:You should see the cardigan she got me for my birthday.
LEADFEMALE:She can't even pick out a sweater for me, much less a whole person.
SUPFEMALE:I wish she felt better about us.
OTHERFEMALE:She's just gonna have to get used to us.
SUPMALE:I'm staying around.
SUPMALE:If you'll let me.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'll let you.
LEADMALE:Rose Not in the kitchen
OTHERFEMALE:you'll dry out the cheese! See you tonight, Rose.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, ladies.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye, Miles.
SUPMALE:You take care of her.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I can't thank you enough.
LEADMALE:You're welcome.
LEADFEMALE:Let's get to the important stuff
LEADMALE:who am I going out with tonight? Well, uh James says he never wants to see you again.
LEADMALE:And, uh the truth is, I'm going out with Thomas tonight.
LEADFEMALE:You're not upset, are you, Blanche? Well, no, I'm not upset.
LEADMALE:It serves me right.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, matter of fact, take the Mercedes.
LEADMALE:Have a good time.
LEADMALE:Blanche, that's awfully sweet of you.
OTHERFEMALE:You got this coming.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:I would like to report a stolen Mercedes.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Woe is me.
LEADMALE:Woe, O, woe is me! Problem, Blanche? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:It's my hair
OTHERMALE:it has split ends, it's dull and listless, it makes my face look Its age? If you're gonna make fun of somebody, make fun of Rose.
LEADMALE:I need the professional care of the most talented hairdresser in Miami
LEADFEMALE:Robert.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he's brilliant.
SUPMALE:Do you know he was the first one ever to use mousse? I'd check my facts if I were you, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Ingrid of St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf has been using moose ever since I can remember.
LEADMALE:Of course, it's his own professional secret which part of the moose he uses.
LEADMALE:But it'll keep your hair in place in winds up to I just don't believe you, Rose! Ask Conway Twitty.
OTHERFEMALE:The problem is, Robert charges $300, and it's just not in my budget this month.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's the trouble with being beautiful
LEADMALE:the maintenance will kill you.
LEADMALE:I have an idea, Blanche.
SUPMALE:How about moonlighting and making some extra money? Another job? Rose, I already work my fingers to the bone "Picasso on your left, snack bar downstairs.
SUPFEMALE:" It's a wonder I'm not an alcoholic.
OTHERMALE:What I meant was, how about working for me? I'm swamped with this project for Enrique Mas, and there is money for an assistant.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell me more.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we're compiling statistics on supplemental healthcare for seniors.
SUPMALE:Some companies are preying on fear and then using loopholes to avoid paying claims.
LEADMALE:For someone on fixed income, it's a matter of life and death.
OTHERMALE:By "Tell me more," I mean, "Does it pay $300?" Well, I suppose that'd be OK.
LEADFEMALE:But I can't believe, with something this important, that you are still so self-centered.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:Count me in.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, can you drive me to the mall Friday night? They're giving free blood pressure tests, and some of the girls and I have a high-low bet.
OTHERMALE:Ma, honey, don't you remember? Friday night we're planning on having dinner at Joe's Stone Crab.
LEADMALE:Oh? It's your wedding anniversary.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, right.
LEADMALE:Sounds nice.
LEADMALE:Ma, you didn't forget, did you? Oh, forgive me, I forgot something.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you should ship me back to Shady Pines.
LEADMALE:Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be in the living room being feeble.
LEADMALE:If I can find the living room!  Dorothy, what just happened? Well, weren't you listening? Sophia came in and asked Dorothy to drive her to the mall for a blood pressure test.
LEADFEMALE:And then Dorothy told Sophia that they had a date to go out to dinner Friday night, and then Sophia said Would you hand me the newspaper? Oh.
OTHERMALE:No, the "Metro" section.
LEADMALE:that she and the girls Hey, don't kill the messenger.
SUPMALE:It's Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:She's becoming more forgetful.
SUPFEMALE:And she denies it and she gets mad.
LEADMALE:How bad is it? Bad.
LEADFEMALE:It's not just a matter of small things anymore.
LEADMALE:I can't believe she forgot this dinner.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, every year since my father died, I've been taking her out to dinner on her wedding anniversary, because she's lonely.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you'd better talk to her doctor about this.
LEADMALE:You're right, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I've just been hoping that things would improve by themselves.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I never thought Ma would lose her memory.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, I never thought Alan Alda would get on my nerves.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, can we talk for a minute? I'm going through the family album.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I'd pay your father a visit.
LEADFEMALE:Look, here we all are! Your sweet sixteen party, right? Right! Look at that beautiful chiffon dress.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, your brother Phil always did like to make a splash.
OTHERMALE:Ah, look! The Jersey shore, summer 1939.
LEADMALE:Pop sure loved playing with you kids.
LEADFEMALE:Why do I look so upset? Oh, Ma, don't you remember? Pop was a big fan of Jean Harlow's back then.
SUPFEMALE:You hated it when he made sand breasts in front of the children.
SUPMALE:He was really some character.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, look at us.
OTHERMALE:Oh, boy, your father sure looked stupid.
SUPMALE:Stupid? Ma, this was one of your favorite pictures.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Pop looks so proud.
LEADMALE:The idiot's dressed like an organ grinder.
LEADMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, he is.
LEADMALE:Remember, we had no money, and he refused to go on assistance.
LEADFEMALE:He vowed that he would take any job to feed his family.
SUPFEMALE:And we had meat on the table every night.
OTHERMALE:I don't know he did it on 10 cents a day.
SUPFEMALE:Where's the monkey? Oh, look, there you are, stirring sauce.
LEADMALE:Ah, my old kitchen.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:And there are the potholders Grandma made, your pasta maker.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, the pantry.
LEADMALE:Remember what Pop kept behind the pantry door? Yeah, he carved a giant heart there that said "Sal loves Sophia.
LEADMALE:" No, Ma, it was our height measurements.
OTHERFEMALE:He kept track of them on the back of the pantry door.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, that was my kitchen, that was my Sal, and he put the heart there because he loved me.
SUPMALE:That I remember! I'm sure you do.
LEADMALE:Listen, Ma why don't we talk to your doctor and see what he has to say, hmm? Yeah, well maybe.
LEADFEMALE:I don't remember half these photos.
SUPMALE:I don't remember Brooklyn.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't even remember you going off to your senior prom.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, I never went to my senior prom.
OTHERFEMALE:Actually, I did remember that, but why should I be the only one here to feel like crap? Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I thought you were gonna be working.
LEADMALE:You don't think playing three sets of tennis in this heat is work? When are you gonna get the survey done? Rose, let me explain something.
LEADFEMALE:Now, in this world, there are two kinds of people.
LEADFEMALE:One is an industrious, hardworking, give 100%, pain-in-the-butt-to- everybody-else go-getter.
SUPMALE:I am not one of those people.
LEADMALE:Gee, I wish I felt better about this.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I wish you did, too.
LEADMALE:Sophia, Dorothy, how did it go at the doctor's? It was great.
LEADMALE:He said that Ma's memory problem could be related to a nutritional imbalance, so he put her on a special diet, and if she follows it, she'll be fine from here on out.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, lucky me, I can remember from now on.
SUPFEMALE:My whole past is gone! I could have slept with JFK and don't even know it! Ma, I don't think so.
OTHERMALE:You're not mentioned in any of the books.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that doesn't necessarily mean anything.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, come on, now.
SUPFEMALE:He also said that there are things that you can do that might bring back some of what you've lost.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we could talk about the good old days, reminisce with old friends.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, you have to look on the bright side.
LEADFEMALE:I've had a lifetime of bright sides.
LEADMALE:I'll just have to learn to do without them.
LEADMALE:Oh, dammit.
SUPFEMALE:I hate watching what this is doing to her.
LEADFEMALE:I hate watching what it's doing to you.
SUPFEMALE:I hate watching those FBI warnings at the beginning of video rentals.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hello, sir.
LEADFEMALE:I am conducting a phone survey regarding healthcare for the elderly.
LEADFEMALE:May I ask your age? That's not so old! And what's your general health? That's good.
OTHERMALE:What would you say is your annual income? Oh, that's very good! Marital status? Oh, I am sorry.
LEADMALE:How long? Three weeks! I'd say it was time you were getting on with your life, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you very much.
SUPMALE:Blanche, marital status is not a question on the survey.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm sorry, Rose, but I ask a man 20 questions, you can bet your life one of 'em's gonna be, "Are you married?" I can't believe it! Haven't you done anything? Of course I have.
LEADFEMALE:Do you see this big stack right here? Well, just behind it is what I have done.
SUPMALE:It's only one survey, but I'm very proud of it.
SUPFEMALE:I should've known this was gonna happen.
LEADMALE:You should never work with friends.
LEADMALE:You're fired.
LEADFEMALE:You can't fire me.
SUPMALE:That's against the law
LEADMALE:that's sex discrimination.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'll give you one more chance.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute! How is it sex discrimination? That's what I was doing this afternoon when I didn't get this work done.
OTHERFEMALE:How's Sophia? I don't know.
SUPMALE:Today's her anniversary.
OTHERFEMALE:She won't come out of her room.
LEADMALE:I've never seen her like this.
LEADFEMALE:She is really depressed.
LEADMALE:Adios! Everybody wave goodbye! I'm off to Brooklyn! Honey, what are you doing? I'm going back to the old neighborhood.
LEADMALE:The doctor said it would help if I stirred up some memories.
LEADMALE:Ma, you can't go back there alone! No kidding.
LEADMALE:I'm 83.
LEADFEMALE:I walk to the driveway, it's a coin toss whether I get back.
OTHERFEMALE:You're coming with me.
LEADFEMALE:I am? What the hell? You paid! Look, I can deal with losing some of my memory.
SUPFEMALE:If I didn't have to remember what's-her-name over here, I wouldn't care.
SUPFEMALE:But Sal was the most important person in my life, and scrapbooks aren't doing the trick.
LEADFEMALE:OK, Ma, if this is what you really want to do It's not what I want to do, it's what I have to do.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, today is my anniversary, and I barely remember getting married.
LEADMALE:You know, I hate getting old.
LEADFEMALE:You always seem to be losing something.
SUPFEMALE:First it's your eyesight.
LEADMALE:Then people are telling you to turn down the TV set when you can barely hear it.
LEADMALE:And you could live with that.
LEADMALE:But this? They're trying to take something from me that I just won't give.
OTHERMALE:I can't let this happen, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I can't lose my Sal.
OTHERFEMALE:Not again.
LEADMALE:Isn't it good to be back in the old neighborhood, Dorothy? Watching the kids playing stickball on the corner? Ma, they were beating a man.
LEADMALE:That was sort of why I called the police.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, they were just having a good time.
SUPMALE:Now, look, Ma, I don't want you to be disappointed if the new tenants don't let us in.
SUPFEMALE:Buenos dÃ­as.
SUPMALE:Oh, God! I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
LEADFEMALE:This is my mother, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Petrillo.
LEADMALE:I know this is going to sound odd, but we used to live here many, many years ago, and we were hoping that we could look around
LEADMALE:you know, for old times' sake.
LEADFEMALE:Would that be possible? Petrillo? They let Italians live here?! Look, we came all the way from Miami.
LEADMALE:Please? OK.
LEADMALE:But don't take anything.
LEADFEMALE:I'm meeting my family, so I can only give you a little while.
SUPMALE:We appreciate it very much.
OTHERMALE:You see, my mother is having a memory problem.
LEADFEMALE:We were hoping that if we looked around the apartment There's no need to explain.
SUPFEMALE:I have an elderly mother myself.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, One more thing.
LEADMALE:Yes? Don't take anything.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, look
SUPMALE:my old wallpaper.
SUPMALE:Oh, God, it feels the same.
LEADMALE:And that big old window I used to look out of.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma, I remember when I was a little girl playing out in the street.
LEADMALE:I can still hear your voice.
LEADFEMALE:"Dorothy, fix your dress
LEADFEMALE:the whole neighborhood can see your business.
LEADFEMALE:" Sounds like me.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, we don't have too much time.
SUPMALE:OK, let's get in the kitchen.
SUPMALE:I want to show you that heart your father carved for me and prove to you I'm not totally crazy.
LEADMALE:Ma, remember, it's only a carving.
LEADMALE:Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, I may be fading, but that's the sweetest thing that man ever did for me.
SUPFEMALE:I know that heart's behind the door.
LEADMALE:I can't believe it! They must have sanded it off.
SUPFEMALE:No, Ma.
LEADMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:See, Ma, it's our height chart.
OTHERFEMALE:You can see it through the paint.
SUPFEMALE:See? Here's Phil, Gloria, me.
LEADMALE:I could have sworn I would have bet my life on it.
SUPMALE:Oh, Ma, there are so many memories in this apartment.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be so down.
LEADFEMALE:You remember the day you brought Phil back from the hospital? I was a little upset, because that was the day Pop usually took me to the zoo.
OTHERMALE:Well, it was the racetrack, but he called it the zoo.
LEADMALE:You kept Phil in this room because it was the warmest room.
OTHERMALE:And I guess I was a little starved for attention, because I remember Oh, Salvadore, isn't he beautiful? A piece of art.
SUPFEMALE:But what do you have him in Dorothy's hand-me-downs for? So he wears girls' clothes for a while
LEADFEMALE:what's it gonna hurt? Dorothy! Sal, do something about your daughter.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, come over here.
LEADMALE:We know you're upset about the new baby, but we need for you to be a big girl.
LEADFEMALE:Your mother's had a rough week.
LEADMALE:First I'm called away, and then the baby's delivered by a cabby.
LEADMALE:Cesarean! Now I know you think Phil here's taken your place.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I wanna tell you something.
LEADFEMALE:I love you more than anything.
LEADFEMALE:Even more than the Dodgers on five-cent beer night? OK, even more than that.
LEADFEMALE:Wow! Daddy, I love you.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, too, kiddo.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, let's go to the zoo.
OTHERFEMALE:I got a tip on a giraffe in the sixth race.
LEADMALE:Heh heh! Pop sure taught me a lot about sibling rivalry that day.
LEADMALE:When we got home I went right over to the baby and said, "I love you, Phil.
LEADMALE:" No, wait.
LEADMALE:I wrote it on him.
LEADMALE:Here you go, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Finished my work.
LEADFEMALE:Well, turn me upside down and paint me blue! Well, give me my money.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I'm sorry we fought the way we did, but this work for senior healthcare is very important to me, and I was hoping it would be to you, too.
OTHERMALE:Well, it wasn't, but it is now.
OTHERMALE:It is? How could I help it? After I looked through the paperwork, I realized how expensive healthcare is for the elderly.
LEADFEMALE:You know, some folks have lost their life savings.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, people ought to write their congressman or something.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, I am so touched, when you cut my check, don't make it out to me.
LEADMALE:That's beautiful, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Make it out to "Hair by Robert.
SUPFEMALE:" I'm not gonna declare it as income and let those lazy congressmen have my tax dollars! Blanche, I don't wanna do that.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, all right, just pay me under the table.
LEADMALE:Oh, sure! I know that trick.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy's done that to me before.
SUPMALE:I go under the table and you never show up.
LEADMALE:No way! Boy, this room is sure alive with memories.
LEADMALE:Those were good days.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'll go up to the bedroom.
LEADFEMALE:Sal and I spent our most intimate moments there.
SUPMALE:Ma Ma, is there anything I can do for you? Yeah, stay out.
LEADMALE:You barged in on me enough when you were a kid.
SUPMALE:Sally, what's going on? What's wrong with me? You think you got problems? Try being dead.
OTHERFEMALE:Heh heh.
LEADFEMALE:Sal! What the hell are you doing here? Relax.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not really here.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just a Fig Newton of your imagination.
SUPMALE:Oh, Sal, it's been so long, I've forgotten how much you used to like Norm Crosby.
LEADMALE:So, how are things? "How are things?"! Sal, talk to me.
LEADFEMALE:How are you? What's new? What's heaven like? You know, everyone thinks heaven is right above.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, it's a little more to the left.
LEADMALE:What's God like? Nice.
SUPFEMALE:You should see his car! Oh, before I forget, Gladys says hello.
OTHERMALE:You fooling around with Gladys? Of course not.
OTHERFEMALE:Gladys is going out with Charlemagne.
LEADMALE:Sophia, I see from upstairs you've kind of lost your spunk.
LEADMALE:What's the matter? I'm slipping, Sal, and it's frightening.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm even forgetting you, forgetting the good old days.
LEADMALE:And what, I'm supposed to feel sorry for you? That'd be a start! Nah, the Sophia I know is a survivor.
SUPMALE:That's why we got married.
LEADFEMALE:You beat out a lot of other women.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, there was a helluva long line waiting to get to you, Sal! What's the name of that girl with the warts? You see? Some things you do remember.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but only some things.
LEADFEMALE:I'm 83, Sal.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have the energy for this.
OTHERFEMALE:You have lost your spunk.
LEADMALE:You know, maybe I don't find you so attractive anymore.
LEADMALE:What?! You're not the same Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:I wonder how Gladys and Charlemagne are doing.
LEADMALE:Sure, the guy rewrote history, but can he juggle? Salvadore Petrillo, you miserable botchagaloop! If you so much as look at another ghost See? There's the spunk.
SUPMALE:It's still there.
OTHERMALE:But use it for yourself, not on me.
LEADFEMALE:You think I can be OK? If I didn't, would I have made the trip? I miss you, Sally.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I'm always with you.
LEADMALE:And when the time's right, see you at my place.
LEADMALE:Ma.
LEADMALE:Ma, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Hernandez has to go.
SUPMALE:I'm meeting the wife and kids.
LEADMALE:We are going ice-skating.
SUPMALE:Dorothy! Oh, my God! Can you believe it? Hey, Puerto Ricans can ice-skate! Jeez! Dorothy! Dorothy, look! It's the carving.
SUPMALE:See? "Sal loves Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:" Oh, Ma! You're Sophia? That's right.
SUPMALE:And I remembered.
LEADFEMALE:I mixed up the rooms, but I remembered.
LEADMALE:Of course.
SUPMALE:I thought the carving was in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:Sal used to hang his salamis in here.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, I may be fading, but I'm still holding on to some of the big things.
SUPMALE:Yeah, and you might get more back.
OTHERMALE:"Might"? I insist! All I need is a little more spunk.
LEADMALE:Imagine finding that carving in here! Kitchen, bedroom
SUPFEMALE:I knew it was a room I was good in!
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Ma.
SUPMALE:What you doing? Thinking.
LEADFEMALE:About what? About wind, water, rocks.
LEADFEMALE:Man's place in the delicate balance of nature's harmony.
LEADFEMALE:Where we're going.
SUPMALE:Where the road ends.
LEADMALE:Gee, Ma, I never knew you were so philosophical.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not.
LEADFEMALE:It's those damn Infiniti commercials.
LEADMALE:They're driving me crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Hello! Where is everybody? We're out here, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:What's all that? Weight-loss products I have to test for work.
SUPMALE:You wouldn't believe the length people go to just to drop a few pounds.
LEADMALE:I heard about one woman who even had her jaw wired shut.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Is that something that you'll be testing, Rose? Oh, here you all are.
LEADFEMALE:How'd your physical go? Oh, just fine.
SUPFEMALE:The doctor could not believe it when I told him my age.
LEADFEMALE:Why? What age did you tell him? Blanche, what is that thing? She's decided to install a change machine.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's, um, it's called a Holter monitor.
LEADMALE:It makes a ticker tape of the heart.
SUPMALE:What's wrong with your heart? Oh, nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Dr.
LEADMALE:Stein just thought it sounded a little irregular.
OTHERFEMALE:I think it's 'cause I was so uncomfortable sittin' there topless with a strange man.
LEADFEMALE:Next time, just pretend you're at home and he's the bug guy.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, what did the doctor say? Oh, he just muttered something in Latin.
LEADFEMALE:I explained to him that Simon and I have been going out every night, and it's just fatigue.
LEADFEMALE:And then what did he say? He wants to match the heartbeats that this records to my activities, so, for the next 24 hours, I have to write down everything I do.
SUPMALE:And you're not embarrassed to have him read that smut? I'm proud of you, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, if this were me, I would be really scared.
OTHERFEMALE:When I'm scared, I put my head between my knees.
OTHERFEMALE:That's for nausea.
OTHERFEMALE:When I'm scared, I'm nauseous.
LEADFEMALE:You remember what happened when that man tried to steal my purse? Worked better than mace.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.
SUPMALE:Well, anyway, all the same I've gotta get busy writin' down my activities, and I'd better call Simon and cancel our date for tonight.
SUPMALE:You know, I'm really starting to care about him, and I wouldn't want him worrying about my recording his performance.
LEADFEMALE:You know how fragile men's egos are.
SUPFEMALE:One little thing like screaming out the wrong name, and they go all to pieces.
LEADMALE:Nice pants, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:They're called vacuum slacks.
LEADMALE:It's supposed to inhale all the fat from your body.
LEADFEMALE:Watch.
LEADFEMALE:I  I must've done it wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I ought to put it on suck.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hello, ladies.
SUPMALE:What'd the doctor say? Oh, bad news.
LEADMALE:Oh, what? Oh, he told me he was married.
SUPFEMALE:Besides that, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, well He was a little concerned because my pulse was slow and misbehavin'.
SUPMALE:Rose, those pants, not with those shoes.
LEADMALE:Blanche, the doctor.
OTHERFEMALE:You know how they get over the slightest little thing.
OTHERMALE:And? And Dr.
LEADMALE:Worrywart wants me to check into the hospital for more tests.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, have you been fooling around with my Tip O'Neill calendar? No, Ma, I haven't.
SUPMALE:Come on! I'm missing March.
LEADFEMALE:It's the month where he's playing volleyball with Jesse Helms.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, not now! Blanche's doctor wants her to go back to the hospital for more tests.
OTHERFEMALE:It makes sense, just to be on the safe side.
LEADMALE:Of course it does.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of doctor would he be if he didn't wanna check out everything? Yeah, well, if it makes him happy.
SUPMALE:If everything's as bad as he thinks it is, he wants to put a pacemaker in me.
LEADMALE:Everybody's got a nickname for it.
SUPMALE:I don't think I've ever been so scared in all my life.
OTHERMALE:You know what I do when I'm scared? You toss your cookies.
LEADMALE:I mean besides that.
LEADMALE:I sing.
LEADFEMALE:You what? A lullaby my mother used to sing to me when I was a little girl.
LEADFEMALE:So, when I'm scared or alone, I sing it and it gives me courage.
SUPMALE:No song is gonna help me.
OTHERFEMALE:Over there Over there Send the word, send the word over there That the Yanks are coming That is the lullaby that your mother sang to you? Well, it was the only song she knew.
LEADMALE:During World War I she gave out donuts and coffee to the doughboys before they boarded the trains for Europe.
LEADFEMALE:It works, truly.
OTHERFEMALE:She said no one can be scared when they hear that song, except maybe the Kaiser.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't need a song.
SUPFEMALE:I just wanna be young and beautiful and healthy again.
LEADMALE:Blanche, that's what we all want.
LEADMALE:I know, but I deserve it.
OTHERMALE:How are we feeling, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Devereaux? A little nervous.
LEADFEMALE:You really don't need makeup.
LEADMALE:Well, I wanna look good just in case.
OTHERMALE:Just in case what? In case something should go wrong.
SUPFEMALE:I've been to enough funerals to see how they make up dead people.
LEADMALE:They look like clowns.
LEADMALE:You expect to see a dozen of 'em jump out of one coffin.
LEADMALE:Well, nothing will go wrong.
LEADFEMALE:I've done this a hundred times.
SUPFEMALE:You'll be fine in a week.
SUPMALE:All we do is cut a small incision below the collarbone, make a little pocket for the pacemaker under the muscle, then feed a tiny wire through the vein and into the heart.
SUPMALE:Then the pacemaker gives little electric shocks to the valve which regulates the heartbeat.
LEADMALE:You mean you're gonna cut into me? You did know that.
LEADFEMALE:Won't that leave a scar? Two inches, tops.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't have any scars.
LEADFEMALE:See, my clothes are all off-the-shoulder.
OTHERMALE:Sooner or later.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:I have to give this some more thought.
LEADMALE:No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:We don't have time for that.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody's already washed their hands.
LEADMALE:Believe me, it'll be all right.
LEADFEMALE:Is anything wrong? She just realized there's going to be a scar.
SUPFEMALE:It's really just last-minute stage fright.
SUPMALE:All my patients have it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey, I'm sure it'll be nothing.
OTHERMALE:You'll hardly notice it.
LEADMALE:That madman wants to rip me open from stem to stern.
LEADFEMALE:Your two favorite parts.
LEADFEMALE:Are we ready? I reckon so.
OTHERMALE:How do I look? They won't be able to take their eyes off you.
LEADFEMALE:Over there  Over there Send the word, send the word over there That the Yanks are coming, the Yanks are coming The drums rum-tumming everywhere Say a prayer, say a prayer Send the word, send the word to beware How's Blanche? She's fine.
LEADFEMALE:She'll be up and back on her back in no time.
LEADMALE:Sophia, It's been wonderful watching you take care of Blanche all week.
SUPMALE:I feel like a regular hospital worker.
SUPMALE:Ah, that's nice.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I just took all the money and jewelry out of her nightstand.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's my money, old woman? I knew that would get her up.
OTHERFEMALE:I was born to heal.
OTHERMALE:Here's your money, and your high school ring, class of Give me that.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, it's good to see you back to your old self again.
LEADMALE:But don't forget the doctor said nothing too strenuous for a few days, then you'll be fine.
LEADFEMALE:I am not back to my old self.
LEADMALE:As a matter of fact, I may never be.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? I know this sounds crazy, and if it hadn't happened to me, I wouldn't believe it either, but while I was being operated on, I had an out-of-body experience.
OTHERMALE:I was floating, looking down at myself.
OTHERFEMALE:I-it was like it was like Like the mirror on your bedroom ceiling? It was like I was my own conscience.
LEADMALE:That's when I knew things were different.
LEADMALE:Different how? I was in that gray area between life and death.
OTHERFEMALE:The time has come for me to re-evaluate my life, for me to take stock of myself.
LEADMALE:I just know that there's a part of me that nobody's ever seen.
LEADFEMALE:I find that hard to believe.
OTHERMALE:If a 5,000-year-old Indian shows up, tell him I wanna know more about his people.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Dorothy, guess who's on Johnny Carson tonight? Who? Johnny Carson.
OTHERFEMALE:Must be the anniversary show.
SUPMALE:Rose, what's that supposed to be? A flab stimulator.
SUPFEMALE:You hook these things to your muscles.
LEADMALE:They give out an electric charge and help get rid of unwanted fat deposits.
LEADMALE:Does it come in a hat? Where's Blanche? She's out on a date with Simon.
SUPMALE:It's her first time out, so who knows when she'll be home? Checkout time is usually noon.
SUPMALE:You know, Blanche has been without a date for weeks.
SUPFEMALE:I know that because all the pictures on my wall are straight.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, it's never easy to go without.
LEADFEMALE:I remember when my mother-in-law came to stay with Sal and me when we were first married.
LEADMALE:For two months your father and I didn't have sex.
SUPFEMALE:Why not, Ma? She slept in between us.
SUPMALE:It was a very small place.
SUPMALE:Have you ever seen an Italian after he's gone without? Hm, no.
SUPFEMALE:That's because your father was the only one.
LEADFEMALE:She finally left, didn't she, Sophia? Yeah.
SUPMALE:I'll never forget that day.
SUPMALE:Your father stayed home from work.
LEADMALE:Unfortunately, I couldn't get the day off.
SUPMALE:I don't know what he did, but he was happy when I got home.
LEADFEMALE:Since Charlie was a traveling salesman, sometimes I'd be alone for weeks.
LEADMALE:I used to have so much trouble sleeping, I tried counting sheep.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, if there are real sheep in this story, I do not wanna hear it.
LEADFEMALE:OK.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Simon.
SUPMALE:Good to see you again.
SUPFEMALE:How have you been? A little lonely, but I'm better now.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's sweet.
LEADMALE:I cannot believe how much I've missed this little girl.
LEADFEMALE:This guy is growing antlers.
SUPMALE:I guess I'd better say goodnight.
SUPMALE:I had a very nice time.
SUPMALE:You mean, uh, our date is over? Well, we went to dinner and a movie.
LEADMALE:Wh-what's left? I never know.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I-I'm just not ready yet.
OTHERFEMALE:You understand.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, as long as it's my only choice.
SUPFEMALE:I've had a life-altering experience, Simon.
OTHERFEMALE:I need time to think, to gather my priorities and put 'em all in perspective.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever you need.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll call you tomorrow? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:You're not upset, are you? No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, what a beautiful night.
SUPFEMALE:Think I'll push the car home.
SUPMALE:Your date is over? You sound surprised.
LEADMALE:Well, it's just that your dates usually end with a little pillow talk.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, like, "What did you say your name was again?" I would've expected my three best friends to understand that I'm just not ready yet.
SUPMALE:But, Blanche, the doctor said you could do everything you did before.
LEADFEMALE:That's all very well for him to say.
OTHERFEMALE:The doctor's not me.
LEADMALE:Blanche, what are you saying? I've made a decision.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche Devereaux has given up sex.
LEADFEMALE:And what does that do to the morale of our boys overseas? Good news, girls.
OTHERMALE:I've gained four pounds.
LEADFEMALE:How is that good news? Well, it means that all those weight-loss products don't work.
OTHERMALE:Now, to lose those four pounds I guess I'll have to go on a sensible diet that I know gets results
SUPFEMALE:the St.
SUPMALE:Olaf "I can't believe this is cheese" diet.
SUPMALE:How does it work? You eat nothing but rice.
SUPFEMALE:Good morning, ladies.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, a Popsicle-stick purse for you.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, a Popsicle-stick potpourri box, and for you, Rose, two lovely Popsicle-stick earrings.
SUPFEMALE:So, Blanche, how are we enjoying our celibacy? Oh, just let me get a Popsicle.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be right with you.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I'm worried.
LEADMALE:That's all you've been living on for two weeks.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, if I don't eat the Popsicle, how am I gonna get to the stick? I'm glad you found a hobby, but, uh, I don't think Blanche Devereaux is going to be happy making things out of Popsicle sticks instead of making love.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I don't care about that anymore.
SUPMALE:I don't care about anything anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Life has no meaning.
SUPMALE:So, who's for popcorn? I don't know what to expect of myself with this thing in me.
OTHERMALE:I just keep remembering how you're not supposed to overload electrical outlets.
LEADMALE:Maybe you just shouldn't make love when you're wet.
LEADFEMALE:It was not an easy decision, but it's best that I retire from the sexual arena undefeated.
SUPMALE:Time I hung up my gloves.
LEADFEMALE:Gloves? Boy, you do practice safe sex.
SUPFEMALE:Sex is only good when your heart is in it, and that's the one organ I can't count on.
SUPMALE:Oh, now, come on, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know that.
OTHERFEMALE:If that's the way you feel, maybe you should tell Simon so that he'll know where he stands.
SUPMALE:For the last two weeks, he's been standing with his legs crossed.
OTHERFEMALE:I will.
SUPMALE:I'll tell him tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:Blanche has gone without for two weeks.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, that's like Raymond Burr saying, "No gravy.
LEADMALE:" What do you think is the matter with her? Maybe when she had that out-of-body experience, she didn't get back in all the way.
OTHERMALE:Try to discuss science with kids.
LEADFEMALE:Um I wanna thank you for a lovely evening.
SUPMALE:I didn't think you noticed.
LEADMALE:You hardly said a word all evening.
OTHERMALE:Where are the other girls? Oh, they all went out to a movie.
LEADFEMALE:Simon, that's why I wanted to come back here.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted us to be alone.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, baby.
SUPFEMALE:What? Um Here.
LEADFEMALE:I don't really know how to say this.
SUPMALE:I never thought I'd ever be sayin' this in my wildest dreams, and you know just how wild they can get.
SUPFEMALE:What I'm trying to tell you, Simon The last time we made love was the last time.
LEADMALE:I guess it's just lucky that we took those snapshots.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talking about? I am giving up the physical side of my life.
LEADMALE:After what I've been through, I cannot trust myself to climb the heights of passion anymore, 'cause I can't be sure of ever gettin' back again.
OTHERMALE:I know you have to be concerned about the pacemaker.
OTHERMALE:Wouldn't you be? Blanche, everyone I know over 50 over 40 has a pacemaker.
OTHERMALE:They all lead perfectly normal lives in every way, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:But this is in me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Simon, for the first time in my life I'm I'm just scared of intimacy.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe this is my fault.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe I've been pushing you.
SUPMALE:It's not you.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, you're the same person that you always were.
LEADMALE:You have to believe that.
LEADMALE:Oh, I-I want to, Simon, and I have tried, but I can't.
LEADMALE:Darling, this is not the time for your vivid imagination to give out on us.
SUPMALE:Goodbye, Simon.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if you're gonna kiss me off, I want my kiss.
LEADMALE:Are you all right? I think so.
OTHERMALE:I don't feel any sparks.
SUPMALE:Well, in this instance I'll take that as a compliment.
LEADFEMALE:I am a little hot, but it's nothing I can't handle.
SUPMALE:What did you expect to happen? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I just kept seeing those cartoon characters with the smoke coming out of their ears.
SUPFEMALE:I don't see anything.
SUPFEMALE:Listen.
LEADMALE:There's a great big old television set back in my bedroom.
LEADMALE:What do you say we go in there and turn it off? Long as you understand I can't make any promises.
LEADMALE:If you'll be brave, I'll be brave.
SUPMALE:Ma, I said I was sorry.
LEADFEMALE:The least you can do when we're gonna see a movie is say it's a foreign film.
SUPFEMALE:What is the big deal? I had to stand at the front of the screen all that running back and forth to complete a sentence almost killed me.
LEADMALE:Wasn't that Simon's car parked out front? Are you sure? Blanche? She's not in here.
SUPMALE:Maybe she had trouble with her pacemaker, and since we weren't here, she called him.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God.
SUPFEMALE:Over there Over there No, I said over there! Send the word, send the word over there 
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:My heart! My heart! Everything has gone black.
LEADMALE:I'm coming to you, Sallie.
OTHERMALE:Ma! Oh, God! Oh, God.
SUPMALE:Oh, God! Hang on, Ma! Oh, please, please, hang on! All right, but you have to do me a favor.
SUPMALE:To the moon, Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:If you wanted a favor, you could just ask.
LEADMALE:There are only two things I look forward to each day, and both of them involve yankin' a chain.
OTHERFEMALE:Has anybody seen Blanche? She had a date last night, and this morning her bed's all made and she's not even there.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Here's our walking playground now.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, it must be true love.
SUPFEMALE:This guy is slowing down to 5 miles an hour.
LEADFEMALE:Mornin', everybody.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, what is going on? That guy's a little young, even for you.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talkin' about? He's a mature young man with his own business.
SUPFEMALE:Now, who wants to help me pick out five magazines? Blanche.
LEADMALE:Please.
OTHERMALE:I'm in no mood for ridicule.
LEADFEMALE:I've been going through a very tough time lately.
LEADFEMALE:We're concerned, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Jealous and concerned.
LEADMALE:You haven't drowned yourself in young men since this time last year, when you brought those twins home from the Jimmy Smits look-alike contest.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, Jorge and Esteban.
LEADMALE:Romantic, passionate and virtually interchangeable.
LEADMALE:Rose is right.
SUPFEMALE:Every year at this time you start robbing the cra- Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:By any chance, does somebody have a birthday coming up? All right, yes, damn it.
SUPMALE:It's almost my birthday.
LEADFEMALE:And I intend to forget all about it.
OTHERMALE:And if you are indeed my friends, you will forget about it, too, and never bring the sordid subject up again.
OTHERMALE:I know I'm gonna give her a party! You know, I actually feel sorry for Blanche Don't you, Ma? Who's Ma? Who are you? Just ask the damn favor.
OTHERMALE:I need your help tonight for a charity.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:I have a date.
LEADFEMALE:You call that a date? Thyroid Freddie? His eyes bug right out of his head.
OTHERFEMALE:He looks like he's being choked.
SUPFEMALE:Now stop it.
OTHERFEMALE:Freddie is a fine man.
SUPFEMALE:When he was younger, he could've been an astronaut, except for, well, you know, that eye thing.
LEADFEMALE:I've been working for this Meals on Wheels program, and I need a driver.
LEADMALE:Please? Oh, all right, Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll cancel Banjo Eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry.
SUPMALE:There'll be other dates, Gloria.
LEADMALE:Ma, Gloria is my sister.
SUPMALE:I'm Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:There'll be other dates for Gloria.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I gotta agree with ya, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Ferguson.
LEADFEMALE:Bobby Vinton is the king of rock-'n'-roll.
SUPMALE:Ma, it's getting late.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have to stay and visit with every one of them? Excuse me for trying to get more involved in their lives.
LEADMALE:That's fine, Ma, but did we really have to worm Mrs.
SUPMALE:Jenkins' dog? Bup, bup, bup, bup.
LEADFEMALE:I always just leave this one outside the door.
SUPMALE:Really? It's been that way since I took over the route.
SUPFEMALE:OK.
SUPFEMALE:This is Mrs.
SUPMALE:Taylor.
LEADMALE:You'll get along with her just fine.
LEADMALE:Two things One, compliment her cat, and two, Jews control the planet.
SUPFEMALE:Got it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, Fluffy.
OTHERFEMALE:Lookin' good.
LEADFEMALE:Ma.
SUPMALE:Ma.
LEADFEMALE:He's not old.
LEADFEMALE:He's a perfectly healthy young man.
LEADFEMALE:Just be home before midnight, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Go away.
LEADFEMALE:Just a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You're not old, you're not ill.
LEADMALE:You're no slave to fashion.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you taking this food? Well, I'm hungry and I'm on the list.
OTHERFEMALE:Who do you think you are? Sergeant Zbornak, Food Police.
LEADMALE:Now, look, I don't want any trouble.
LEADMALE:Just hand over that turkey loaf.
OTHERFEMALE:No, you can't.
SUPMALE:I need this food.
SUPFEMALE:Except for the carrot-raisin salad.
LEADMALE:I've never understood carrot-raisin salad.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Taylor, it's Flintstone, not Flintstein.
OTHERFEMALE:Lovely neighbors you got there, Mr? No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Get away! Go over there.
LEADFEMALE:Move! OK, OK.
LEADMALE:Take it easy.
LEADFEMALE:Who's the macadamia? So, uh, how you doin' today? Uh, look, I don't understand.
LEADMALE:You're obviously not handicapped.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I'm just as disabled as anyone here.
LEADFEMALE:I find that very hard to believe.
SUPFEMALE:You don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:It's just too hard out there.
SUPMALE:I haven't been out of this apartment in 22 years.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I didn't know.
LEADFEMALE:Enjoy your dinner.
SUPMALE:How pathetic a person could live their life totally alone, devoid of companionship or love.
LEADFEMALE:I wish I could do something.
LEADMALE:Start a club.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, how'd things go tonight? I am so happy that I volunteered for Meals on Wheels, and I think I'm really making progress with Jimmy.
SUPFEMALE:Although I could make more if Ma would stop yelling "Boo!" You're really taking an interest in that man.
OTHERMALE:What happened to him, anyway? The turmoil of the '60s just got to him.
SUPMALE:The '60s were an emotional time for all of us.
LEADFEMALE:I can still see Big Daddy sitting on the porch swing, swilling down home brew, picking off peaceniks with his BB gun.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, God, I miss that man.
LEADMALE:Come on, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure Grand Dragon I mean, uh Big Daddy is always with you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I can see why your friend got disillusioned, but I don't see why he withdrew for 22 years.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I can.
SUPMALE:It happened to me.
LEADMALE:When Stanley walked out, I was so devastated, I locked myself in my bedroom.
LEADFEMALE:It was the one place that didn't remind me of Stan.
LEADMALE:And I just never wanted to come out.
LEADMALE:Fortunately, someone was there to get me out of that room.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, Pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Sophia, this birthday thing kinda has me depressed as well.
LEADFEMALE:You think you could help me, too? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:No matter how bad things get, remember these sage words you're old, you sag, get over it.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia! So what if you knew Jesus personally? Wake up and smell the coffee, you fossil.
SUPMALE:My mistake.
LEADFEMALE:I thought since you looked like Yoda, you were also wise.
SUPFEMALE:Here it is.
SUPFEMALE:I needed to know when Blanche's real birthday was so I could throw her a party, so I got copies of her birth certificate, her DMV files Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Rose, that is an invasion of privacy.
SUPMALE:What makes you think she wants a party? Everybody wants a party, no matter what they say.
SUPFEMALE:If you think we don't need to know Blanche's real age, maybe we should Open the damn envelope.
LEADMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:After all these years, we're finally gonna know.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna know the true age of Blanche Devereaux.
SUPFEMALE:"Deleted by authority of the governor.
LEADMALE:" Oh, they These are all like that.
LEADMALE:Rose, you know what this means? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:She must have really jumped on this guy's bandwagon.
LEADMALE:You almost got it, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? Jimmy.
LEADFEMALE:It's me Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm fine, thanks.
LEADMALE:What's new with you? Oh, of course.
LEADMALE:Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:That's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, no.
LEADMALE:I'll be right over.
OTHERFEMALE:I have done it.
LEADMALE:A breakthrough.
LEADMALE:Jimmy is tired of isolating.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that's great, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think I like this whole situation, Pussycat.
LEADMALE:Aw, come on, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:I'm helping.
SUPFEMALE:You're not a shrink.
LEADFEMALE:Be careful.
SUPMALE:Don't let your ego get involved.
SUPFEMALE:My ego is not involved.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I'm nobody special, Ma.
LEADMALE:I'm just an average citizen.
LEADFEMALE:I saw another citizen, and I reached out.
OTHERFEMALE:A man changed his life, and I'm just somebody who helped him do it.
SUPMALE:Me, Dorothy Zbornak miracle worker.
LEADMALE: Who is it? Jimmy, open the door.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, I'm so glad you came.
LEADFEMALE:Of course I came.
LEADFEMALE:This is a big day for you.
LEADMALE:It is.
LEADFEMALE:I can't live like this anymore.
SUPMALE:Oh, I am so happy.
LEADFEMALE:I am, too.
SUPMALE:Hey, let's celebrate.
LEADMALE:Party time.
OTHERFEMALE:The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind Jimmy.
LEADFEMALE:Look, why don't we just save this as sort of a treat for later on, hmm? 'Cause first there's something I want you to do.
LEADMALE:I want you to step out here, the way you do when you pick up your tray.
SUPFEMALE:OK.
LEADFEMALE:Now take another.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Now, how about one more? That wasn't so hard.
LEADMALE:How does it feel? So many years inside, I forgot how much I love to travel.
LEADFEMALE:You see, Jimmy, you put one foot in front of the other.
OTHERFEMALE:That's all it takes.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna get you out of here and to that counselor.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no.
LEADMALE:We're not going to any counselor.
SUPMALE:I thought you were tired of isolating.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I am.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, you're the first person I've trusted in years, and you're absolutely wonderful, and I want you to live with me.
LEADMALE:Live here? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:All this can be yours.
SUPFEMALE:All this? Well, it does sweeten the pot, but Jimmy, I think you're missing the point.
SUPFEMALE:You can name six of the Chicago Seven.
LEADFEMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't say that.
OTHERMALE:David Dellinger.
SUPFEMALE:Seven.
SUPMALE:Take me.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Jimmy, I like you, but not in that way.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:First person I reach out to in 22 years, and then you reject me.
LEADMALE:Jimmy No, no, forget it.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, you can't trust anybody.
LEADFEMALE:I thought this place wasn't gonna be my prison anymore.
SUPMALE:I thought for a second I remembered what "happy" was.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thanks, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm never gonna leave this apartment again.
LEADMALE:"Miracle worker.
LEADFEMALE:" I'm an idiot.
LEADMALE:You have to stop beating yourself over the head with this.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:You're not the one who made him drop out or the one who made him a recluse.
LEADMALE:You're not the one who made him decide to live his life behind closed doors.
LEADMALE:You're just the one who made it stick.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe Jimmy'll come around.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I wish I could believe you, but, Rose, I have been there.
SUPFEMALE:After a while you feel you're just in this gigantic black hole.
LEADFEMALE:We had a gigantic black hole back in St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, God.
LEADMALE:On Main Street, right in front of the courthouse where Charlie and I got our marriage license and our permit to have kids.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it was a lovely hole.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody in town would stand around and look in it.
LEADMALE:And they say Hollywood is the entertainment capital of the world.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we didn't just look in it.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes we'd point, too.
LEADMALE:Or spit and time it.
SUPMALE:Then there was always that wise guy who'd have a couple of drinks and unzip himself and It's official.
LEADFEMALE:I hate her.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Ma, I just want to give him a call.
LEADFEMALE:Pussycat, you're out of your league.
LEADFEMALE:There are some people you just can't help.
OTHERMALE:It's like the Good Lord said "You gotta know when to hold 'em.
SUPFEMALE:Know when to fold 'em.
SUPMALE:Know when to walk away.
OTHERFEMALE:" Ma, that's not the Good Lord, that's Kenny Rogers.
LEADFEMALE:God, Kenny Rogers.
LEADFEMALE:Tomato, tomah-to.
LEADFEMALE:The point is, there are others you can help.
SUPMALE:All those people on our route they depend on us.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Ma, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I must say that helping always makes me feel better.
LEADMALE:You wanna come, Rose? Oh, no thanks.
LEADMALE:I have to figure out which of the traditional St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf party games to play at Blanche's party.
OTHERMALE:Party? Is that why you've been sneaking around trying to find out my age? A party? I forbid it! Blanche, a party is a celebration of life, and it's not just for you, but for your friends who love you.
LEADMALE:No! Stop being so vain.
SUPMALE:You can't stay 42 forever.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, you can if you eat right, exercise regularly and live with women who look a lot older than you.
LEADMALE:Tell me, Rose, is "Kill the Bitch" a traditional St.
LEADMALE:Olaf party game? I'm sorry, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Ferguson.
LEADFEMALE:No, I didn't happen to see Ed Sullivan last night, but I'm sure it was a good one.
LEADMALE:She's ready, God.
LEADMALE:That bell is you, Fluffy.
LEADMALE:Jimmy Jim-- Jimmy, I just want to make sure that you're OK.
LEADFEMALE:Do I have to play hardball? David Dellinger.
LEADFEMALE:Don't do this to me.
LEADFEMALE:Bobby Seale.
OTHERMALE:It's getting warm in here.
SUPFEMALE:Tom Hayden.
SUPMALE:Oh, God, you're good.
LEADMALE:Abbie OK! Just come on in here, you.
SUPMALE:What do you want? I don't understand you.
SUPMALE:I see a perfectly healthy, intelligent person living like this alone.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not alone.
OTHERFEMALE:I've got my fish.
SUPFEMALE:Fish don't reject you and fish don't judge you and fish You gotta feed fish.
SUPMALE:Jimmy, you deserve more.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, I thought I'd found it, but you dumped me.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I'll bet you've broken hundreds of hearts in your day, huh? Thousands? Well, yes, I have.
LEADMALE:I mean, wherever you go, I bet you torment and tease and tantalize every man you meet.
LEADFEMALE:You're right again.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, Jimmy, we're getting away from the point.
OTHERMALE:You are missing the point.
LEADMALE:You are missing life.
OTHERMALE:You are missing people.
LEADMALE:People who are happy, people who are in love, people who are towing my car away? I'd loan you my Auto Club card, but it's really expired.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe you're right.
LEADMALE:Maybe I can't help.
SUPFEMALE:You need professional help.
SUPFEMALE:I hope someday you get it.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you think I wanna go with you? Dorothy, I look out that window, and I see the happy couples walking by, people walking into the supermarket.
SUPFEMALE:God, you want me to get on a bus and go see a counselor? I can't even shop for my own food.
SUPMALE:What I wouldn't give just to make my own dinner once.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, brunch is what I miss the most.
LEADMALE:Aw, Jimmy, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's take that extra step today and go to that supermarket.
OTHERMALE:You won't be sorry.
LEADMALE:Jimmy, the world is filled with wonderful and exciting people.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take your suggestion, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Taylor.
SUPFEMALE:I'll play the Jackie Mason tapes at half speed, but I really don't think I'm gonna hear anything.
LEADFEMALE:I can't do it, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Jimmy, you've come this far.
SUPFEMALE:Do I have to? Jimmy, you're at a crossroads.
OTHERFEMALE:The next step you take could be the most important one of your life.
LEADFEMALE:Now, look, you trust me.
OTHERFEMALE:Jimmy, make that step.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:Go.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations! You're our one-millionth customer and winner of an all-expense paid trip to Mardi Gras!  Blanche, where have you been? I've been out walking.
OTHERMALE:You know what today was? It was my birthday.
OTHERMALE:Blanche Don't start your yammering.
OTHERMALE:It was one of the best birthdays I have ever had.
LEADMALE:I did some soul-searching, and it occurred to me that I'm a vibrant energetic woman.
SUPMALE:I must still have some life left in me if I can make Mel Bushman's head snap back like that.
SUPMALE:You mean "Old Pez Head"? You know, Rose, you were right.
LEADFEMALE:What's in a number? Why, I still have my health, I have my challenging career at the museum.
OTHERMALE:Most of all, I have you all my family.
SUPMALE:All that birthday nonsense was just an exercise in vanity.
LEADFEMALE:And so today, for the very first time, Blanche Devereaux is gonna reveal her true and accurate age.
LEADFEMALE:Right after you tell me your weight.
LEADFEMALE:Coffee? Please.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, now calm down.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma, how can I? Dorothy, what's wrong? What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong.
LEADFEMALE:I single-handedly ruined a man's life today.
LEADFEMALE:Which hand? This hand.
SUPMALE:What difference does it make what hand? I ruined him.
OTHERFEMALE:I was in over my head.
LEADMALE:I played with fire, and I lost.
LEADMALE:Jimmy.
SUPMALE:You forgot your sweater, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:How did you get here? I walked.
LEADMALE:Well, I'd like you to meet my roommates Rose and Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like us to? No, no.
LEADFEMALE:I gotta start getting used to people.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, you should know that when I got back to my place, I did some thinking actually, I did some shaking and then I did some thinking and I realized I was alone again.
LEADFEMALE:After meeting you, I don't want to be alone anymore.
LEADMALE:You're my friend, and if there's nice people like you out here, maybe the world's not such a bad place.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:I know this isn't gonna be easy, but I want help.
SUPMALE:Help and new clothes.
OTHERFEMALE:So, I'll go to a counselor if you'll drive me.
LEADFEMALE:Drive you? Are you kidding? I'll listen to eight-tracks with you.
LEADMALE:'Course, we'll have to use Rose's car.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, but whatever you want, Jimmy, I'm there for you.
LEADMALE:I'm so glad this all worked out.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in here.
LEADMALE:I'll fix us some coffee.
OTHERFEMALE:Great idea, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:I think I can make it if I take it a little bit at a time.
LEADMALE:Sure you can.
LEADMALE:Surprise! Ho! Ho! Ho! I'm gonna kill you! Rose, this is just a great party and the perfect gift.
LEADMALE:How'd you know what I needed? Oh, you.
LEADMALE:Come here.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose, good God.
SUPFEMALE:My heart is still poundin'.
SUPMALE:I was just in an accident.
SUPFEMALE:Honey.
LEADFEMALE:But don't worry.
LEADMALE:I'm all right.
OTHERMALE:I'm OK.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, thank God.
LEADMALE:Any damage to your car? Well, that's the one bright spot.
LEADFEMALE:I had borrowed yours.
SUPFEMALE:My car? You didn't ask if you could borrow my car.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess we both learned a lesson about leaving keys on the table.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:How did it happen? Well, you know how I like to meet rich men by gently rear-ending expensive cars at red lights? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, you say that like it isn't great.
OTHERMALE:Rose, it's the perfect plan.
OTHERFEMALE:You get to meet the guy, exchange addresses, then when he asks you who does good body work, you give him your phone number.
SUPFEMALE:And this really works? Well, not this time.
SUPFEMALE:I had this really cute guy in a Jag lined up when this dork in a Duster cut in front of me and I nicked him instead.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I am furious.
LEADFEMALE:First you take my car without asking.
SUPFEMALE:Then, when you have it, you show complete disregard for my personal property.
LEADMALE:Rose, please have a little compassion.
SUPMALE:I was just in an accident.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what do you want me to do, carry you to your room? Massage your neck? Make some cocoa? Diet cocoa.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm going out again tomorrow.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche Oh, hi, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:How was the funeral? It was a humdinger, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:We closed the place.
LEADFEMALE:Where's Sophia? She's taking this pretty hard.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess she needs a couple of minutes by herself out in the car.
LEADFEMALE:We're really gonna have to be there for Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, Sophia's like my own mother.
OTHERMALE:Until she feels better, I'm not gonna think about anything else.
SUPMALE:My car! It's ruined! It's just a little scratch.
LEADMALE:I can live with it.
OTHERFEMALE:What did you do with it? Rose Do we have to do this now? A nun has died.
OTHERFEMALE:More than a nun.
SUPFEMALE:Sister Agnes was my mother's best friend.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, she's out there alone now.
LEADMALE:She hasn't said a word since we left the cemetery.
SUPFEMALE:I have no idea how she's going to react to this.
LEADFEMALE:I've made a decision.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna become a nun.
LEADFEMALE:Well, at least now you know.
SUPMALE:Ma, what are you talking about? God spoke to me today at the funeral.
OTHERMALE:He told me to join the order.
LEADMALE:God spoke to you? You haven't been eating chili dogs again, have you? That was an honest mistake.
SUPFEMALE:And to clarify, that's when I thought God was whistling to me.
LEADFEMALE:This was him talking.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you think I know how crazy this sounds? But it really happened.
OTHERMALE:Ma, I don't believe you.
LEADMALE:God said you'd say that.
SUPFEMALE:Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:He said you'd say that, too.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, stop this.
LEADMALE:Three for three.
SUPMALE:Ma, this is ridiculous.
SUPMALE:You don't want to be a nun.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, I do, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:God reminded me today that I've always had a dream, a very private dream, one I never talked about.
OTHERMALE:When I was growing up, I wanted to join the convent.
LEADMALE:Well, until I was 17.
LEADFEMALE:What happened then? Your father put his hand in my blouse.
LEADFEMALE:So? So I felt soiled, filthy, dirty.
LEADMALE:You know, in love.
LEADFEMALE:But this time, I'm gonna fulfill my destiny.
LEADMALE:This time, I'm gonna become a nun.
LEADMALE:Do you believe what we just heard? I can't believe anybody would want to be a nun.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, "nun.
LEADMALE:" The word says it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're not gonna believe this.
LEADFEMALE:I've just been talking on the phone for a half-hour, and guess what.
LEADFEMALE:You forgot to dial first? No You held the receiver upside down? Unh-unh.
LEADFEMALE:It wasn't even the phone, it was the TV remote control.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:A shoe? Blanche, please.
LEADMALE:I'm not an idiot.
LEADFEMALE:The TV has a remote control? Anyway, this could be kind of important.
SUPMALE:What? Do you remember Mr.
LEADMALE:Nivingston, the guy whose rear end you smacked? Well, my insurance company just called, and the guy is claiming he hurt his back.
LEADMALE:He's threatening a lawsuit unless we settle out of court.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's terrible.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:And I'm the one he's suing, 'cause it's my car.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! Ha-ha! Oh.
SUPMALE:Boy, you had me goin' there for a second.
LEADMALE:I thought you meant he was suing me.
LEADFEMALE:Whew.
SUPMALE:What? Blanche, Rose may be taken to court for something that you did.
OTHERMALE:Don't you even care? There's nothing to worry about.
SUPFEMALE:He's just tryin' to hold up his insurance company.
LEADFEMALE:There's nothin' wrong with that man's back.
OTHERMALE:How can you tell? Because I know the crooked walk of man when his back has been injured.
LEADFEMALE:I cannot tell you how many men I have seen limp out of my bedroom.
SUPFEMALE:Shoulders stooped and their backs curved.
LEADMALE:Blanche, that's different.
LEADMALE:That's shame.
LEADMALE:Oh, Sister Claire, how nice to see you again.
SUPFEMALE:Come in.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, this is Sister Claire.
LEADFEMALE:She interviewed me last week about joining her order.
SUPFEMALE:Please, sit down.
LEADMALE:Ma, you actually went to a convent? Why didn't I know that? Because you're divorced.
LEADFEMALE:Technically, in the eyes of the church, you don't even exist.
LEADFEMALE:I spit on you.
LEADMALE:Unless, of course, the sister would like to spit on you first.
LEADFEMALE:I'm her daughter Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll have to excuse my mother.
LEADMALE:She suffered a slight stroke a few years ago which rendered her totally annoying.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh, what brings you here? The follow-up interview.
LEADMALE:We have very strict guidelines when selecting postulants, so we're going to put Sophia through a battery of psychological tests.
LEADMALE:It helps weed out the crazies and undesirables.
SUPMALE:Sorry, Ma.
LEADMALE:Can you imagine? Rose is tryin' to blame the whole thing on me.
SUPMALE:That woman has one hell of a lot of nerve.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
OTHERMALE:I'm a Baptist.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Sister, is it all right if I sit in? I don't think my mother would mind.
LEADMALE:Think again.
LEADFEMALE:I'd go outside, but there don't seem to be any shady pines to sit under.
SUPFEMALE:Pillow, Pussycat? We'll start with the ink blots.
SUPMALE:Uh, "Who was a 1950s black singing group?" Am I right? Am I in? Am I a nun yet? She watches a lot of Jeopardy! No, no.
SUPMALE:You look at each one and tell me what you see.
LEADFEMALE:It's a standard test used by psychologists, but we find it useful in our line of work, too.
OTHERMALE:Now what do you see? I see an angel.
LEADFEMALE:Very good.
LEADMALE:How 'bout this one? Uh, I see a dove perched upon the throne of God.
OTHERMALE:Excellent.
SUPFEMALE:And this? I see the Blessed Mother smiling sweetly as she pours love upon the hearts of the righteous standing at the gates of heaven, while St.
SUPFEMALE:Peter Ma! Come on, you're making that up.
SUPFEMALE:I am not.
LEADMALE:Look, anyone can clearly see that is a picture of John Forsythe lying naked in a pool of honey Isn't it? Do you think I would lie to get into the convent? It does look a little like John Forsythe, doesn't it? Look, sister, I'm sorry you made this trip for nothing, but this has gone far enough.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, I cannot believe that you actually want to go through with this.
LEADMALE:Who cares what you believe? I had a beautiful experience.
LEADFEMALE:God has called me, and I intend to answer.
LEADMALE:You're really serious about this, aren't you? Yes, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:This means a lot to me.
SUPMALE:Do you think I could leave you that easily? A minute ago you were gonna spit on me.
SUPMALE:Do you have this much trouble with your kids? What's wrong, Rose? It's my insurance company.
OTHERMALE:They've cut me off because of the lawsuit.
OTHERMALE:What am I gonna do? Well, you need a good lawyer.
LEADFEMALE:Give me the keys to your rental, and I'll go out and see if I can nail one for you.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, that's how you got me in trouble before.
OTHERMALE:Isn't there anything else you can do? Well, I suppose we could prove Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Nivingston was faking his injury if we could trick him into performing certain physical acts of a sexual nature.
LEADMALE:All we'd need is a devastatingly beautiful woman with a flair for seduction.
SUPFEMALE:How about Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Hufstad down the street? I mean, she's something of a dog, but she'll do it with anybody.
LEADMALE:I was talkin' about me.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:You will, too.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, I won't go all the way.
SUPFEMALE:I'll just get him in the bedroom and, uh, put him through the normal warm-ups.
SUPMALE:And we'll have a certain Scandinavian nitwit hidin' in the closet with a camera.
LEADFEMALE:Wouldn't it be better if I hid in the closet? Yes, Rose, I suppose it would.
LEADMALE:But do you really think you can get him to remove the neck brace? Oh, please.
LEADFEMALE:I once got a man to crawl out of a full body cast.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm almost ready to go.
LEADMALE:Today? You're not goin' today? Why didn't you tell us? Every time I bring it up, one of you tries to talk me out of it.
LEADMALE:We were just being selfish.
LEADMALE:We didn't wanna lose you.
SUPFEMALE:There's my ride.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Sophia.
OTHERMALE:Yep.
LEADFEMALE:It's a Granada full of nuns.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, you have no idea how much we're gonna miss you.
LEADFEMALE:It's like losing a member of the family.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose is right.
OTHERMALE:You're just like a mother to us.
LEADFEMALE:We feel like your daughters, too.
SUPMALE:I feel the same way.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, just remember, you're smarter than people say you are.
SUPMALE:You've got common sense and you know what you're doing.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Sophia.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, you're a slut.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I better go.
OTHERMALE:Nuns don't keep well in a hot car.
LEADMALE:We'll go out and tell 'em you're on your way.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess this is it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just so sorry that it took me so long to realize how much this meant to you.
LEADFEMALE:It's just very hard for me to let go.
OTHERFEMALE:Me too.
LEADFEMALE:But someone else needs me more.
LEADFEMALE:It's time for me to move on.
LEADMALE:My job here is done.
OTHERMALE:I always love it when you talk like the Lone Ranger.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, I want you to know that I support your decision.
OTHERFEMALE:I think you'll make a great nun.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:I needed to hear that.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, Ma.
SUPMALE:I love you, too, Tonto.
LEADFEMALE:Careful, Arthur.
LEADFEMALE:Watch your step.
SUPMALE:Blanche, if I only could.
LEADMALE:Oh, forgive me, sugar.
LEADFEMALE:Well, here, I'll watch it for you, you poor thing.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I can't believe how nice you're being to me even though I'm suing your friend.
LEADMALE:Well, I've always been attracted to ever-so-slightly younger men.
LEADMALE:Besides, just look at you.
LEADMALE:Ooh! Must be so frustratin' for an athlete like you.
LEADFEMALE:Did you ever play any college ball? No.
LEADMALE:As a boy, I got as far as the Pee-Wee leagues, but then I discovered stamps.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:You know, when I first saw you, I said to myself, "Philatelist.
OTHERFEMALE:" I like that.
LEADMALE:Ooh, you're gettin' so tense.
LEADMALE:Hey, why don't we go in my bedroom, see if we can't loosen you up a little? Oh, I'm not sure.
LEADFEMALE:See, my lawyer/n I mean, my doctor/n Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I get 'em mixed up.
LEADMALE:They're both in the same mall.
LEADFEMALE:You just forget about that old doctor.
LEADMALE:I know a little bit about physical therapy myself.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure you do, but, you see/n If it'll make you feel better, I have a complete nurse's outfit hangin' up in my closet.
LEADMALE:I gotta tell you, that does make me feel better.
SUPFEMALE:What else have you got in there? Ooh, ho-ho-ho-ho.
LEADMALE:Wait! What am I doing? I can't play nursey.
SUPFEMALE:I-I'm supposed to have whiplash.
LEADMALE:If we can't be together soon, I'm gonna have to go with somebody else.
LEADMALE:I haven't been with a man since my husband died nine years ago, and I'm just about ready to explode.
LEADMALE:I'll see you tomorrow, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, this is really beginning to chafe.
SUPMALE:Ar-- Were you able to get him to bed? No.
LEADMALE:Rose still in the closet with the camera? Yes.
LEADMALE:Maybe you'll get him tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, Rose.
LEADMALE:Out of the closet, I see.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I'm back.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I got a card from Ma.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dorothy, read it out loud.
LEADFEMALE:"Dear Pussycat, I have everything I need, but it's hard to get a decent bikini wax.
LEADMALE:" Oh! Ha-ha.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:"Dorothy, I remember you fondly, and the same goes for Blanche and Rita.
SUPFEMALE:" "Wish you were here.
SUPMALE:"No one can reach the third shelf in the pantry.
SUPMALE:Best, Sister Ma.
LEADMALE:"  God, I miss that woman.
LEADMALE:Say what you want about her, we all loved having her around.
LEADFEMALE:I miss someone to have a chat with at midnight.
LEADMALE:You know what I'm gonna miss most about Sophia? The way she used to tease me.
SUPMALE:The way she would ever-so-subtly jab me with names like "tramp" "Floozy.
LEADMALE:" "Trollop," "harlot.
LEADFEMALE:" "Magic carpet ride.
SUPFEMALE:" "The human luge.
SUPFEMALE:" But she was never cuter than when she simply called you "shore leave.
LEADFEMALE:" Oh, God, I miss that woman.
SUPMALE:OK, is everybody in? I got a pair of jacks.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:Wait, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:I have the two, seven, jack, ten and/n that's right/n a four.
LEADMALE:That doesn't beat a pair of jacks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it did when you had it.
SUPFEMALE:I told you.
SUPMALE:That's called a "Whizzer.
OTHERMALE:" It's only good once a night.
SUPMALE:Uh, I'll be putting this in the collection box later.
LEADMALE:Sophia? Clear out.
LEADFEMALE:It's the man.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Reverend Mother.
SUPFEMALE:My, you look holier-than-thou today.
LEADMALE:Save it, Sister Suck Up.
SUPFEMALE:How do you explain this note I found in the suggestion box? You said we needed money for the chapel.
SUPFEMALE:I thought that would be a good fund-raiser.
SUPFEMALE:A beefcake calendar of "Monks of the Midwest"? Oh, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Open up your mind.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, I'm going to go pray now.
LEADMALE:I won't tell you what I'm going to pray for because it would hurt your feelings.
LEADMALE:But when I'm done, I expect a complete change of attitude.
LEADFEMALE:Understand? Ooh, I'm so scared.
SUPMALE:What is she gonna do, take away my self-denial privileges? Ma.
SUPMALE:Pussycat, what are you doin' here? Oh, I just missed you and wanted to say hi and see how you're doin'.
LEADFEMALE:I'm doin' fine.
LEADMALE:Ten days celibate.
LEADMALE:Same here.
LEADMALE:Ma, I have a little surprise for you.
LEADMALE:Girls? Oh Look who it is.
OTHERMALE:It's Blanche and Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Where's the surprise? Honey, we're your surprise.
LEADMALE:We came to see you.
OTHERMALE:Nice to see you.
LEADFEMALE:What a lovely surprise.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome to our little convent.
LEADMALE:Not even a Bundt cake, huh? Look at you.
LEADMALE:A nun.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't think I'd be shocked like this.
SUPMALE:It's just that you look so different than when Blanche is dressed as a nun.
LEADMALE:So, uh, what's new at home? Oh, I did get a chance to go into your bedroom, Sophia, and there's just no way I'll be able to refund your cleaning deposit.
LEADMALE:Totally understandable.
SUPMALE:I'll see you in court, my child.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia.
OTHERMALE:Mother Superior, this is my daughter Dorothy and my ex-roommates.
OTHERMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Sophia, why don't you run along? I need to talk to your daughter alone.
SUPFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever she says, I have an alibi.
SUPMALE:So, Dorothy, I'll bet you love your mother a lot.
LEADMALE:Well, that depends.
LEADFEMALE:What has she done? It's not necessarily anything specific.
LEADFEMALE:It's my feeling that life here is too structured for her.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm afraid I don't follow you.
LEADFEMALE:She is a stubborn, old, vindictive pack mule of a woman who won't follow the rules.
LEADFEMALE:OK, I'm back with you.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, I think her intentions are good, but this doesn't seem to be her calling.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, but this means so much to her.
LEADMALE:Oh, this would break her heart.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask her to leave.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mother Superior, with your permission, may I be the one to tell her? We've been through so much together, I'm sure that any bit of bad news would be easier to take if it came from me.
LEADMALE:Well, then, here's another one for you.
OTHERFEMALE:We've seen her room.
SUPFEMALE:Tell her she won't be getting her cleaning deposit back.
LEADFEMALE:God, I'm so confused.
LEADMALE:I don't know where I belong.
OTHERMALE:I'm trying to wrestle with the deep religious questions of the ages.
LEADMALE:Like, what do you really want from me? What is my real purpose in life? What was Edward G.
LEADMALE:Robinson doing in The Ten Commandments?  Come in.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, where are Blanche and Rose? Oh, they wanted to browse in the gift shop.
SUPFEMALE:They're having a sale on John the Baptist placemats.
LEADMALE:Ma, do you remember that summer you told me I didn't get into Girl Scout camp, and you said we were gonna have more fun than any two people ever had? They want me out? Yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I don't get it.
SUPMALE:I know God wants my life to be meaningful.
SUPMALE:That's not gonna happen unless I'm here.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, your life is meaningful.
LEADMALE:You do nothing but help other people.
LEADFEMALE:You do Meals On Wheels, Red Cross, volunteer hospital work.
LEADMALE:The point is, you don't have to be in a convent to make your life meaningful.
SUPMALE:I mean, Sister Agnes belonged here, but you don't.
LEADMALE:So who's gonna take Sister Agnes' place? Nobody can take her place.
SUPMALE:Just like nobody can take your place.
SUPFEMALE:I miss her.
SUPMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go home.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:But I'll be missing movie night.
LEADFEMALE:But so what? After the tenth time, it isn't the greatest story ever told.
LEADFEMALE:Here you go, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Guess it's gonna take you a little while to get adjusted to being home from the convent, hmm? To tell you the truth, Dorothy, it isn't that much different.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa! Give me that film.
LEADMALE:Rose, go! Run! Good to have you home, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, look at all these flowers! Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:Who died? Did one of us die? They're mine, Sophia.
LEADMALE:They're from a secret admirer.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, look.
OTHERMALE:I got flowers.
SUPFEMALE:Two bouquets of lousy, stinking flowers.
SUPMALE:They're from my secret admirer, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Do you like 'em? Every single one of 'em? Oh, it just figures.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dorothy, you mustn't feel so bad.
LEADFEMALE:Why, this is a big day for you, too.
LEADFEMALE:A girl always remembers the first time she gets flowers.
LEADMALE:Rose, I am a woman in my 50s.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, common sense says that I have gotten flowers before.
LEADFEMALE:So, Dorothy, tell me.
LEADMALE:Are those flowers from men? Are they? Huh? Are they? It doesn't matter.
SUPFEMALE:It's not important that men find your daughter attractive and send her gifts as a token of their affection.
SUPMALE:What is important is that you know it.
OTHERFEMALE:Write it down, all of you.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, these are from celebrities! Oh, Rose, that's private.
LEADMALE:Lyle Waggoner and Sonny Bono! Dorothy.
LEADMALE:My poor, sweet, dead-end Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:You're sending flowers to yourself again, aren't you? Why is it so hard to believe that I am being chased by two men? Shut up, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Last week, I didn't have anything to do one night/n shut up, Ma.
SUPMALE:So I went to the dinner theater and I saw Lyle and Sonny in a production of Equus.
LEADFEMALE:Uh.
LEADMALE:Our six eyes met, Sonny fell into the orchestra pit, Lyle forgot his lines and went into Under the Yum Yum Tree.
LEADFEMALE:Except for the reviews, it was a magical night.
LEADMALE:Sonny Bono and Lyle Waggoner! Dorothy, this is an embarrassment of riches! I wanted to tell you sooner, but, well, I was afraid that you might not believe me.
LEADFEMALE:And why should we, Miss Junior Prom 1946? Ma, you promised.
SUPMALE:"Dating the quarterback," she says.
SUPMALE:Buys her own corsage, spends the evening hiding in the basement, slow-dancing with a rake.
LEADFEMALE:Would've gotten away with it, too, but while giving herself hickeys with a vacuum cleaner, she stepped into a puddle.
LEADMALE:To most mothers, that would be a cry for affection.
OTHERFEMALE:To you, it's just ammo.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just change the subject, OK? If we're done with our journey to the land of make-believe, my secret admirer wants me to meet him for lunch.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, I can't believe you're gonna do it.
LEADMALE:I mean, sure, the flowers are nice, but are you sure you know what you're getting yourself into? Oh, come on, Dorothy, how much trouble can I get into in a public place? How soon we forget the Greyhound terminal incident.
LEADMALE:Here's a good idea, Blanche.
SUPMALE:If you really want to be safe, why don't you let us come with you? OK, you can all come.
LEADFEMALE:But you have to promise me you won't do anything to embarrass me.
LEADFEMALE:I promise.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I promise.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll try, but if they serve me cauliflower, it's in God's hands.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, girls, there are just shivers up my spine.
LEADMALE:His eyes could be on me right now.
SUPMALE:The tension's unbearable.
LEADFEMALE:Can you feel it? Yes, I can.
LEADMALE:It's unbelievable.
LEADFEMALE:Where's the damn waiter? Dorothy? Lyle! I hope I'm not intruding.
SUPMALE:Not at all.
SUPFEMALE:What're you doing here? Well, it's just that we did so many restaurant sketches on  The Carol Burnett Show.
LEADFEMALE:I was waxing sentimental.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, by the way, I'd like you to meet my mother Sophia, Blanche, and this is Rose.
LEADMALE:Yes, it's me.
LEADMALE:Lyle Waggoner.
LEADFEMALE:No autographs.
OTHERFEMALE:No problem.
LEADMALE:Ma! If this is true, I'm rooting for Sonny/n you know, the paisan.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, there's something about this guy that just honks me off.
LEADMALE:So, Dorothy, can I see you later tonight? Oh, I'm sorry, Lyle.
LEADMALE:I'm busy.
LEADFEMALE:Busy? It's Sonny, isn't it? No.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just confused.
SUPFEMALE:I need time to think.
SUPMALE:You take all the time you need.
LEADMALE:But before I go, I want you to know 
LEADFEMALE:I'm so glad we had this time together Just to have a laugh or sing a song Yes, it's me.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Seems we just get started, and before you know it Oh, go ahead, finish your meals.
LEADFEMALE:Comes the time we have to say, "So long" I hate it when he does that.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Devereaux? There's someone in the bar for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, God.
LEADMALE:Oh, girls, this is it.
SUPFEMALE:Can you see him, Rose? Yes, I think I can.
LEADFEMALE:He's coming this way.
OTHERMALE:Oh! He's very handsome.
LEADMALE:OK, here I go.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello Oh, my God! No! All right, so he's not a ten.
SUPMALE:Blanche, honey, please.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:What in hell? Why do you look like that? I don't believe this! What? Blanche, Blanche, who is this? If I didn't know better, I would say my dead husband, George.
LEADMALE:Well, George.
SUPFEMALE:We've heard so much about you.
LEADMALE:Blanche, George followed you all the way home.
LEADMALE:You have to talk to him.
LEADFEMALE:He's alive, all right.
LEADMALE:I poked him with a stick.
SUPMALE:Blanche, Blanche, I know this is crazy.
SUPFEMALE:But I talked to him and I really think it is George.
LEADMALE:And I think you should talk to him, too.
LEADMALE:I'm scared.
OTHERMALE:If you need us, we'll be on the lanai.
LEADMALE:And miss this? Like hell we will.
LEADFEMALE:Shady Pines, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:You're bluffing.
SUPMALE:The west wing.
LEADFEMALE:Right behind you.
LEADMALE:Shady Pines, Rose.
LEADMALE:This really shouldn't work on me.
LEADMALE:George, is that really you? It's me, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:But you're dead.
SUPFEMALE:At least you're supposed to be.
SUPMALE:I buried you nine years ago.
LEADFEMALE:What in hell is going on? Well, I guess the best thing to do is just give it to you plain and simple.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I staged my death.
LEADFEMALE:He stained his desk?! But, George, I arranged your funeral.
LEADMALE:The eulogy, the flowers.
SUPMALE:I even watched 'em put you in the family mausoleum.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, what can I say, Blanche? Thanks.
LEADMALE:What a day.
LEADMALE:I don't know if I can take much more.
LEADMALE:Hi-ho, everybody.
LEADMALE:It's me, Sonny.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, God! Is Dorothy around? She's out on the lanai.
LEADFEMALE:I suppose you're wondering why a man like Sonny Bono Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:On the lanai.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, that is Sonny Bono.
LEADMALE:He's a major television star.
OTHERMALE:Boy, you have been gone a long time.
LEADMALE:I know you're shocked and that this has caused you incredible pain.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you might say that.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't do it to be cruel.
LEADFEMALE:It may seem cowardly, but I didn't know how to tell you that I just couldn't be married to you anymore.
OTHERMALE:How could you say that?! It's Lyle, isn't it? I'm just confused.
LEADMALE:I need time to think.
LEADFEMALE:What's there to think about? Sonny has the eyes of a poet, the soul of a poet.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, you're through with those furry vests, aren't you? Oh, yes, ma'am.
LEADFEMALE:Take her.
LEADMALE:Blanche! Are you OK? No, I'm not OK! I feel like I'm goin' insane.
OTHERFEMALE:My life's been turned upside down.
SUPFEMALE:Just so we're in sync, it's this husband-back- from-the-grave thing, right? Yes, you twit! My husband who abandoned me nine years ago, and shows up now just to tell me he couldn't stand being married to me.
SUPMALE:Blanche.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:I've had some experience in marital discord myself.
LEADMALE:Sonny Bono, get off my lanai.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, before I go, can I make just one more plea for your heart? Oh, all right, Sonny.
LEADMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:That was it.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, Sonny.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, you didn't hear me out.
SUPFEMALE:I've heard all I have to hear.
LEADMALE:I know this is rough for you, but it's been rough for me, too.
SUPMALE:Now you're gonna listen! Nine years ago, I found out that my partner was embezzling from the family company.
LEADFEMALE:He was a clever man.
SUPFEMALE:All the signs pointed to me.
LEADFEMALE:My business was collapsing.
LEADFEMALE:I was facing disgrace, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I could've stayed and faced the music, but it's just this damn Southern pride.
LEADFEMALE:It's the same Southern pride that kept me from being a dancer.
SUPFEMALE:George, please, I've had enough surprises for one day.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, faking my death was a mistake.
OTHERMALE:For the last nine years, every day without you has seemed longer than the one before.
LEADFEMALE:Now you just say the word and I'll go back where I came from, but I guess what I'm really trying to say is Blanche, will you be my wife again? No, Sonny, I haven't made a decision yet.
OTHERFEMALE:Besides, Blanche needs me now.
LEADMALE:Look, I have to go.
LEADFEMALE:No, Sonny.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADMALE:All right, if I do it, will you hang up? I got you, babe I got you, babe Babe Blanche, can I get you something? No, thanks.
LEADMALE:Oh, damn.
LEADMALE:I just can't believe how much my life has changed these past six hours.
SUPFEMALE:George is back.
SUPFEMALE:He wants to get together.
LEADMALE:I don't know what to do.
LEADMALE:Oh, pick Lyle! Pick Lyle! Oh, that's Dorothy's problem, isn't it? I just feel so horrible.
LEADMALE:Why do men do this? Why do they deceive us? Picture it/n Germany, 1922.
LEADFEMALE:Germany? Were you on vacation, Sophia? Spy.
LEADMALE:Eh, it was a summer job.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, while in Heidelberg, XQ-37/n that's me/n meets a man of science.
LEADFEMALE:He gives me classified documents, I give him, well, a peek at the hinterland.
LEADMALE:It's an epic love till it falls to shambles in utter deception.
LEADMALE:He wasn't a man of science? He wasn't a man.
SUPFEMALE:You're making this up, XQ! I can't believe that you were ever a spy.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe I told you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess I'm gonna have to kill you.
LEADMALE:Someone was actually able to deceive me once.
LEADFEMALE:Do tell, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:St.
SUPFEMALE:Olaf's most famous OB/MAG.
LEADMALE:What's that? Obstetrician/magician.
LEADMALE:The Amazing Shapiro.
SUPMALE:He delivered Bridget.
OTHERMALE:But it was so confusing.
LEADFEMALE:"It's a girl! Now it's a dove! Now it's a glass of milk!" I don't know how he got her in that deck of cards, but there she was, right after the King of Hearts.
LEADFEMALE:"Is this your baby?" You know, ever since the funeral I've had this dream where it's all a mistake and George is really alive.
SUPMALE:And I just feel so happy.
LEADMALE:We see each other, we run to embrace, but just before we hug/n always just before we hug/n I wake up.
LEADMALE:And I lie there for a split second thinking George is asleep beside me.
LEADFEMALE:Until it dawns on me one more time that he's really gone, and I grieve again.
LEADFEMALE:I grieved for that man nine years! How can I forgive that? Blanche, honey, you need to get ahold of yourself.
LEADMALE:What I need is for things to be like they were this morning, before any of this ever happened.
LEADMALE:You know, as far as I'm concerned, George Devereaux is better off dead.
LEADFEMALE:Sonny! Sweetheart! My little cannoli! Sophia! Honey! My Mama Celeste! Of course you remember me, Lyle Waggoner.
LEADMALE:Nah, I don't think I do.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, you must remember Lyle.
OTHERMALE:Sonny, Lyle.
LEADFEMALE:What're you doing here? Dorothy, we need a decision now.
SUPMALE:So, who's it gonna be? Me or pizza man? Oh, insults from Lyle Waggoner, huh? How many gold records do you have? None.
LEADMALE:I was never married.
OTHERMALE:Put 'em up! Oh, now, this is ridiculous.
LEADMALE:I do not want two grown men fighting over me.
SUPFEMALE:Pussycat, how many chances are you gonna get? Proceed.
LEADMALE:Lyle Waggoner? You're under arrest.
SUPFEMALE:Arrest? What's the charge? I don't have time to list all of them, but he's a prime suspect in a major crime spree.
SUPMALE:Where? Palm Springs, California.
LEADMALE:It's good to be mayor.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:No, wait.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, have you made a decision? Yes, I have made a decision.
LEADFEMALE:Sonny, I think that Lyle is the sweetest, kindest man I have ever met.
SUPFEMALE:What you have done here is a totally underhanded, inexcusable abuse of power.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Sonny, the power.
LEADMALE:But, Dorothy! Gumba! Ma! All right, now, you kids go out, have fun.
OTHERMALE:I won't wait up.
SUPFEMALE:Do anything you want to her.
OTHERFEMALE:Will do.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mel Bushman is picking me up in 15 minutes.
LEADMALE:Blanche, George called again.
LEADFEMALE:I told you, when he calls, take the message and throw it out.
SUPFEMALE:I'm back to my old self.
LEADMALE:Blanche Devereaux has returned! Oh, boy, strike up the gland! How rude.
LEADMALE:You think she'd feel sorry for me.
LEADMALE:To tell you the truth, I don't feel sorry for you, either.
OTHERMALE:I mean, why should I? My Charlie is dead and nobody's giving me a second chance.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:I know what it's like to have a husband suddenly taken.
SUPMALE:I never had a chance to say all those things I would've wanted to say.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you must know how that feels.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:But after what he did to me Blanche, this isn't about getting even.
LEADFEMALE:For nine years you've been missing George.
LEADMALE:Well, he's here and I'm jealous of you.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell him you love him, tell him you hate him, I don't care.
LEADMALE:But just see him before he leaves.
LEADMALE:Do it for yourself.
SUPMALE:Do it for all of us who wish we had the chance.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy said you wanted to talk to me back here.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Sonny and Rose and Dorothy are making so much noise in the living room.
OTHERFEMALE:So, did you make a decision? Before I can even think about that, there's something I gotta do for me.
LEADMALE:I know this is gonna sound crazy, but I need to ask for your forgiveness.
LEADMALE:What? I'm the one who should be down on my knees after what I did.
LEADMALE:George, the day you died/n or didn't die/n I was home alone when the phone rang.
LEADMALE:I ran to answer it and I tripped over your damn shoes, and I said, "Oh, George, I hate you.
LEADFEMALE:" It was the police telling me you'd been in an accident.
SUPMALE:Never thought I'd have the chance, but I'm so sorry my last thoughts of you were "I hate you.
LEADFEMALE:" Well, honey, you always were fiery.
SUPFEMALE:I love that about you.
LEADMALE:There's more.
SUPMALE:Since the funeral, I've been with other men.
SUPFEMALE:Many, many men.
LEADFEMALE:I always felt like I was cheating on ya.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, every day I was gone, I always wished you'd find somebody who could make you happy.
SUPFEMALE:How-how many men? Two.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, you don't have to ask my forgiveness for anything.
SUPMALE:I love you.
LEADFEMALE:Good God, you're as pretty now as the day we met.
LEADMALE:Remember that first day we met? The University Club Cotillion.
LEADMALE:Our eyes met and I knew you were the only man for me.
LEADFEMALE:So when it was ladies' choice, I sent my fiancÃ© off for some punch, and I strutted up to you and I said, "May I have this dance?" And I said, "The pleasure would be all mine.
LEADMALE:" And I said, "I know it.
LEADMALE:" Oh, those damn eyes.
SUPFEMALE:I still haven't seen in anyone else's what I see in yours.
LEADMALE:Oh! Oh.
LEADMALE: Blanche? You OK? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:I was just checking.
SUPFEMALE:Would you sit with me for a minute? Well, sure, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, you were doing a lot of talking in your sleep.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:You had that dream again, didn't you? I told you, I heard voices in here, and Oh, God, it's Dorothy! I tell you, she takes one tennis lesson Ma, Blanche had her dream.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you all right? I think so.
LEADFEMALE:Usually I feel empty when I realize George isn't here, but this time, it's different.
LEADFEMALE:How? I don't know, the dream was diff Oh, wait.
OTHERMALE:I got to hug him.
LEADFEMALE:You know how always wake up before I get to hug George.
SUPFEMALE:This time I didn't.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, that's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:It was wonderful, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:When he died, I thought, "Oh, the worst part is I'll never get to hold him again.
OTHERMALE:" Tonight I did.
OTHERMALE:I could actually feel him.
LEADMALE:Still can.
LEADFEMALE:And you're gonna be all right? Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
OTHERFEMALE:Get yourself a good night's sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, just out of curiosity, were "they" in the dream? As crazy about you as ever.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry I'm laughing, but the idea of me with one of those two is just so silly.
SUPFEMALE:You picked Sonny this time.
LEADMALE:Yes! Well, good night.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, George.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for bringing the boys over, Dreyfus.
SUPMALE:So long, kids.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I just love it when Dreyfus brings the puppies over to play.
LEADFEMALE:I really think they like it, too.
LEADFEMALE:That's because you bring the stick to them.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:They get so excited when I fetch.
SUPFEMALE:You like having them over, too, don't you, Sofia? Yeah, I like 'em.
LEADFEMALE:That's because it temporarily shifts the blame if we find a puddle on the floor.
LEADFEMALE:Once, Nurse Ratched, once.
SUPMALE:Well, I do not believe it.
LEADMALE:Saturday, and I don't have a date.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you fathom what this means? The jailbreak is off? Oh, come on, Blanche, do what I do when I don't have a date.
OTHERMALE:I curl up with a good book, and I'm satisfied.
LEADMALE:It's my fault.
LEADFEMALE:I read to her as a child.
LEADFEMALE:As a matter of fact, I'm going to the library in a few minutes.
OTHERMALE:Wanna come? The library? That's a great idea.
SUPMALE:I just love libraries.
LEADMALE:You do? I've loved books since I was a child.
LEADMALE:Although I certainly did grow up around some ignorant people.
OTHERMALE:Do you know what horrible thing the folks in my neck of the woods did once when I was a youngun? Besides using phrases like "neck of the woods" and "youngun"? They burned books.
LEADMALE:The townspeople made a big pile of 'em in front of the library and they threw a torch on top.
LEADMALE:Only Big Daddy was outraged.
LEADFEMALE:He fought his way through that crowd, clawed his way to the top of that pile, grabbed that lit torch and turned to that crowd and said, "What are you people doing? This is lunacy.
LEADMALE:Ya start a fire from the bottom.
SUPMALE:" So many books.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why they call it a library.
LEADMALE:It's from the Latin librarius, which means "so many books.
LEADMALE:" I'm sure you'll find something you want.
SUPMALE:I do believe you're right.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:My friend here would like to apply for a library card.
LEADFEMALE:What friend? Oh, the one who's checking out everything but the books.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:What you readin'? Oh, ho-ho.
SUPMALE:You must be a passionate man.
SUPMALE:Females to Fondle? Well, it's volume seven of the encyclopedia.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
SUPMALE:My mother talked me into getting her the new Stephen King.
SUPMALE:Well, we do have the one that came out last Tuesday.
SUPMALE:As long as it's not about some little creature who finds new and inventive ways of terrorizing a household.
SUPMALE:It's for my mother.
LEADFEMALE:I don't wanna give her any ideas.
SUPFEMALE:You're a sports agent? I bet we know some of the same people.
LEADFEMALE:I was one of the first women ever allowed in the Miami Dolphins' locker room.
SUPFEMALE:Reporter? Photographer.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:I don't understand.
OTHERFEMALE:There must be some mistake.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure my mother's card is current.
LEADMALE:See for yourself.
LEADFEMALE:It expired five years ago.
LEADMALE:I don't know how that could've happened, but I'll put the book on my card, and I want you to know my card is always current.
LEADMALE:I come to the library at least three times a week, and my books are always returned promptly during regular library hours, rain or shine.
LEADMALE:Who are you to judge me?! Now, let me get this right.
SUPMALE:Dinner at your place tonight? What kind of girl do you think I am, and how could you tell so fast? My address is on my card, and I have a meeting with a client in a half-hour, so I better get rolling.
OTHERMALE:See you at eight.
LEADMALE:Oh, by the way, Ma, when I was at the library, they said your library card had expired five years ago.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Where could I have been? Oh, yeah, locked in an old-age home.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, I cannot go through with it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna call Ted and cancel.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, you can't.
LEADMALE:Well, but it isn't fair.
SUPMALE:He should've told me he was disabled.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, what a great icebreaker.
LEADMALE:Well, if I have to go, you know what I could do? I could take a chaperone.
SUPFEMALE:That way, I'll avoid any awkward situations.
LEADMALE:You could be my chaperone.
LEADMALE:Oh, please.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm serious.
SUPMALE:You're the perfect third wheel.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't mean that in a negative way.
SUPFEMALE:I just mean you make men uncomfortable.
LEADFEMALE:It's a gift.
LEADFEMALE:Don't waste it.
SUPMALE:As long as you don't mean it in a negative way.
LEADMALE:Of course not.
LEADMALE:Growing up in the South/n God, here it comes! The honeysuckle, mint juleps, three-legged dogs, you and Opie and Floyd and the barbershop Blanche, get to the point.
LEADFEMALE:I need a chaperone.
LEADFEMALE:Now, do I have to call in all the favors you owe me? What favors? I need a chaperone.
LEADMALE:Now, do I have to call in all the favors you owe me? I don't owe you any favors.
SUPMALE:Oh, really? "But, officer, the little old lady was with me.
LEADMALE:She couldn't possibly have put that banana in your tailpipe.
LEADFEMALE:" It'll be an honor to serve.
SUPFEMALE:Guess what.
LEADFEMALE:I spoke with Harry this morning, and he said we can keep one of the puppies.
SUPMALE:No! I can't believe you said no.
SUPMALE:Come on, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:We've talked about pets.
LEADFEMALE:There's no one home during the day to take care of it.
LEADMALE:I'm home during the day.
LEADMALE:No one lucid is home during the day.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please.
LEADFEMALE:I've already named him Bingo, and he really likes me.
LEADFEMALE:He follows me wherever I go.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, the answer is no.
LEADFEMALE:That's not fair.
LEADFEMALE:Last week, you got to keep the boxboy who followed you home.
SUPMALE:There, you see? You don't need a dog.
LEADFEMALE:If you're lonely, get yourself a man.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want a man.
LEADMALE:I just wanna come home from work and have someone jump up on my lap, lick my face and fetch a ball when I throw it.
LEADFEMALE:You can get a man to do that.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:Say hello to the newest member of our family.
LEADMALE:Oh, great, we gotta live with a sad-eyed, hyperactive nuisance with the intelligence of a squeaky toy.
LEADMALE:And now she's got a dog.
SUPMALE:Miss Devereaux? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Won't you come in.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Andy.
LEADMALE:Blanche, come on in.
LEADMALE:Sit down.
LEADMALE:And who's this? Who do I look like? I'm her mother.
LEADMALE:Grandmother.
SUPFEMALE:Having a chaperone is an old Southern tradition.
LEADFEMALE:Grammy here brought me up since I was a child.
SUPFEMALE:She's the one who taught me how to put up peach preserves, make my own clothes.
LEADMALE:We was po'.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, you didn't strike me as the type who needed a chaperone.
LEADMALE:As I said, it was a tradition.
SUPMALE:We Southern families stick together.
SUPMALE:We sho' do.
SUPMALE:Well, I suppose it's been nice having someone look after you since you were young.
LEADMALE:I had to.
LEADMALE:When she was 15, I caught her under a pile of hillbillies.
SUPMALE:Picture it/n me with a crowbar prying cousins off left and right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, goodness, with a view like that, why I bet you look out the window a lot.
LEADMALE:Blanche, you a little nervous? Nervous? Me? Wheelchair.
LEADMALE:Oops I mean, no, no, not at all.
OTHERMALE:Come on, Blanche, most people in wheelchairs were something else until that one second before their accident and their lives change.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, take a look at this guy in the baseball uniform.
SUPFEMALE:I'm still basically that guy.
SUPMALE:Ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Y-You certainly do have a nice place here.
LEADFEMALE:I took it because I spend so much time in Miami, and I do hate hotels.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, I know.
OTHERMALE:The way they charge you for the whole night when you're only there for a few hours.
OTHERFEMALE:My roommate Dorothy told me that.
LEADFEMALE:She's a slut.
SUPFEMALE:I hope you like champagne and caviar.
OTHERFEMALE:I love it.
LEADFEMALE:Andy Oh Oh Hey, look who's not po'.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm, this was just delicious.
SUPMALE:I'm glad you feel more comfortable.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yes.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know why I was nervous in the first place.
LEADMALE:Boy, you should see this bedroom.
LEADFEMALE:A giant-screen TV, a big round bed and lights that go on when you clap.
LEADFEMALE:My hands are raw.
LEADFEMALE:That Southern accent of yours really comes and goes.
SUPFEMALE:Grits.
LEADMALE:Alright? Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:That grandmother of yours is really a sweetheart.
LEADMALE:She sure is.
OTHERMALE:Bless her heart.
LEADMALE:How do we get rid of her? Why, Ted Tanner, are you making a pass at me? If I strike out, I strike out, but at least I want my turn at bat.
SUPMALE:I have to admit, I'm somewhat interested and a little bit curious and suddenly now quite nervous.
OTHERMALE:Maybe it's not meant to be with your grandmother wandering around.
SUPMALE:She has a bus pass.
LEADFEMALE:I can have Andy drive her.
LEADMALE:Come here.
SUPMALE:Well, mercy me.
LEADMALE:Looks like my little magnolia just turned into a big ho'.
LEADMALE:Rose, we have to talk.
LEADFEMALE:Look, the food dish is overturned, there is a hole in the newspaper, the potted palm in the hallway has been dug up.
LEADFEMALE:I cannot live like this.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, please don't send me away.
LEADFEMALE:I'll try harder.
LEADFEMALE:I'm talking about the dog.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:In that case, I also saw him slip two 20s out of your purse.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, obviously the dog has to go.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that's not your decision.
SUPFEMALE:Where's Blanche? She's not home from her date.
LEADMALE:She spent the night at Ted's? You don't suppose that Nah.
LEADFEMALE:Please! Just because a man's in a wheelchair doesn't mean he can't satisfy a woman.
LEADFEMALE:What do you know about this, Ma? Picture it Sicily, 1914.
OTHERMALE:A man in a wheelchair satisfies a woman.
LEADFEMALE:It's a short story, but I think it makes my point.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, my lovelies.
OTHERFEMALE:Sophia, I'm sorry I tossed ya out last night, but it was for a good cause.
SUPMALE:That's OK, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:Andy took me home in the limo, and, boy, did we have fun.
LEADFEMALE:I figured out why they call it a moon roof.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, tell us about your date last night.
LEADMALE:All I can tell you is Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Ted Tanner is quite a man.
LEADFEMALE:He suits me to a "g.
SUPFEMALE:" You mean to a "t.
OTHERMALE:" No, I don't think so, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't hold dinner for me tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I have a date.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I better go get out of these clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Again? Rose, you got a reprieve.
LEADFEMALE:As long as Blanche isn't here, she won't find out you brought a dog into the house.
SUPFEMALE:What do I care if she finds out? I'm not afraid.
SUPFEMALE:I'm within my rights.
LEADMALE:There is nothing in my lease that says I can't have a pet.
SUPFEMALE:All right, who or what ate the heel off one my new red pumps? I did.
LEADMALE:Guess what.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like to brag and it took me practically all morning, but by reinforcing the command with love and a doggie treat, I finally taught Bingo how to sit.
LEADMALE:Sit down, Rose.
LEADMALE:Okey-dokey.
LEADFEMALE:I really wish you'd try to get along with Bingo.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you don't know the fun you can have with a pet? Have you ever actually had one? Of course I had a pet.
SUPMALE:Remember, Ma? I was six years old, and I wanted a pony? Not the pony thing again.
SUPMALE:She promised me a pony.
SUPFEMALE:She swore I'd get a pony.
OTHERMALE:She brings me a little paper bird on a stick from the circus.
OTHERFEMALE:The kind you have to twirl around your head to get them to tweet.
OTHERFEMALE:And that was your pet? They're very clean.
LEADMALE:Then she tells me if I'm a good girl, a really good girl, God will turn that paper bird into a real one, which I believed, because why would a mother lie? So every day, I'm being very good and praying and looking for any sign of life and becoming very attached to that ridiculous paper bird.
SUPFEMALE:So you can imagine my heartbreak when one morning I find it dead.
LEADMALE:How does a paper bird die? Good question.
SUPMALE:Someone used it to restart the pilot light.
OTHERMALE:Hurry up.
LEADFEMALE:Get dressed.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna be late for temple.
LEADMALE:Ma, it's Tuesday, and we're Catholic.
LEADMALE:In that case, bacon and eggs.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, girls, I just don't know what I am gonna do about Mr.
LEADMALE:Ted Tanner.
SUPFEMALE:If the man wants to colorize movies, let him colorize movies.
OTHERFEMALE:It's show business, for God's sake.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, what's wrong? Ted called from Philadelphia, says he's flying in, and he wants to see me.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'd think you'd be happy.
LEADMALE:I am, but it's just that during this past week with Ted out of town, everything was on hold.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't have to make any decisions about where our relationship was going.
LEADMALE:I don't know what to do.
OTHERMALE:I'm here if you wanna pick my brain.
LEADMALE:Rose, I think we should leave it alone and let it heal.
OTHERMALE:It was clear from Ted's tone on the phone that he wants to escalate our relationship.
LEADFEMALE:He said he hoped I wasn't seeing anyone else.
LEADMALE:I just don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I think you should go for it.
SUPMALE:See it through.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, so many times you drop somebody without ever knowing what it could turn into.
SUPMALE:Sometimes you have to take a chance.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know if I'm ready for that kind of risk.
LEADMALE:A little risk only heightens the thrill.
SUPMALE:It's like making love in an airplane lavatory, where you know it's wrong because the guy you're with really should be at the controls.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it was just an example.
SUPFEMALE:Who are you to judge me? Well, Sophia, did you feed Bingo today? To what? Ma, you did feed the puppy today, didn't you? I think we both had one of those international coffees/n mocha minty or something/n I don't know.
LEADMALE:We both threw up a little.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, did that mean old lady put you in the garage? No.
LEADMALE:The mean young lady did.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, Ted's coming over later, and I don't want that dog making a big mess.
SUPFEMALE:He's already been into my personal things.
LEADMALE:Maybe we should get him some rubber toys.
SUPFEMALE:They do seem to be his preference.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Rose, I don't think this is gonna work out.
LEADFEMALE:Now, we are out all day.
SUPMALE:Puppies need care from someone with a knowledge of loving and nurturing.
SUPMALE:And let's face it, that is not Ma.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Bingo, much as I love you, little guy, we've gotta do what's best for you.
SUPMALE:Wish I knew what to say to make leaving easier.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I used to have a little dog just like you back in St.
SUPMALE:Olaf.
OTHERFEMALE:She said St.
LEADMALE:Olaf, Bingo.
LEADFEMALE:I told you, that's the attack command.
LEADMALE:OK.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great news.
OTHERMALE:There's an organization called Pets for People.
LEADFEMALE:They match up pets with old people.
LEADMALE:Well, I took Bingo over there this afternoon, and already they have a perfect home for him.
LEADFEMALE:I hate to say it, but I'm gonna miss the little guy.
SUPMALE:Sure was a lot more fun than that bird on a stick.
SUPFEMALE:Ehh, she's not here.
LEADMALE:Oh, get in here, you.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, I've missed you, Ted.
OTHERMALE:I missed you, too.
LEADMALE:I have so much to tell you about, oh, how good I feel about us and how much I was worried that you being in a wheelchair would be more than I could handle, but you know what? I realized it isn't.
LEADMALE:I just really like you.
OTHERMALE:I am a lucky guy.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't we go someplace romantic for a few days? I have to go back home tomorrow.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, take me with you.
SUPMALE:Show me the wonders of Philadelphia.
LEADMALE:The Liberty Bell.
LEADMALE:The cream cheese.
SUPFEMALE:I can't take you.
LEADMALE:Why not? I just can't.
SUPMALE:Is there someone else? Oh.
OTHERMALE:There's somebody else.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, a girlfriend.
LEADMALE:You got a wife? I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry? I do not believe this.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I kept telling myself to stay open to this, that you were just such a special guy who happened to be sitting down.
LEADMALE:I was actually starting to feel love for you, Ted.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you were noble.
LEADMALE:Never dawned on me you could be a jerk in a wheelchair.
SUPFEMALE:Ach get out.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
LEADMALE:Blanche Devereaux never goes out with another woman's husband.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, except for that one time.
LEADMALE:Now, that was not my fault.
OTHERFEMALE:She was pronounced dead.
LEADFEMALE:Those paramedics never give up.
LEADFEMALE:Don't end this, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:My wife doesn't understand me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I do.
LEADFEMALE:You're a cheat.
LEADFEMALE:Get out.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, as God is my witness, I will never pick up another man.
LEADMALE:In a library.
SUPMALE:On a Saturday.
SUPMALE:Unless he's cute and drives a nice car.
SUPMALE:Amen.
OTHERFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Well, Dorothy, I'm ready to go to work.
OTHERFEMALE:How do I look? Oh, Ma, you look adorable.
SUPFEMALE:Adorable? I want to look aggressive, powerful, like a corporate killer.
OTHERFEMALE:Lose the hat.
LEADFEMALE:Perfect.
LEADFEMALE:Perfect.
LEADMALE:Now you look like the activities director at a retirement home.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma, Ma, your first day.
LEADMALE:You must be really excited.
LEADMALE:You bet I'm excited.
LEADFEMALE:This was a great idea of yours.
LEADMALE:It's given me a whole new lease on life.
LEADMALE:I need a raise.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you haven't even started yet.
SUPFEMALE:I meant help me up.
SUPMALE:These new Underalls are choking my pancreas.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, I think this will be good for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Porter seems like a nice man.
SUPMALE:I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun there.
OTHERFEMALE:And don't forget the money.
LEADMALE:I haven't had a paycheck since 1942, and then I blew it all on war bonds.
LEADMALE:At least you got it back.
OTHERMALE:No, Italian war bonds.
LEADFEMALE:I fell for their slick advertising campaign.
LEADFEMALE:"Buy Italian war bonds/n the quickest, surest, fascist way to double your money.
SUPMALE:" Well, let's go.
SUPMALE:Ma, you want to make a good impression? Matching shoes.
LEADFEMALE:They should match my purse? No, they should match each other.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Cooking? No, Rose, I'm developing pictures from the Magellan space probe.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, I'm cooking.
LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to make conversation.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, I'm concerned about Ma's first day at Cypress Grove.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I'm sure she'll do a fine job.
LEADMALE:No, Rose, you don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:She only thinks that she has a job.
SUPFEMALE:I worked it out with the owner, Mr.
SUPMALE:Porter.
SUPMALE:This flu has really knocked her for a loop, and her doctor says she has to rest for at least three weeks.
LEADFEMALE:I've been working so much, I figured this is the only way I can get someone to keep an eye on her during the day.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, that's dishonest.
OTHERFEMALE:She wouldn't have gone for it if I'd told her the truth.
LEADFEMALE:And, oh, like you never told a lie? That's right.
LEADFEMALE:I've never told a lie.
LEADFEMALE:Well, just once, when I snuck out of class to go to the movies.
LEADMALE:It's not much of a lie.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I thought.
OTHERMALE:Turned out to be the day they taught everything.
OTHERFEMALE:The final piece of the puzzle.
LEADMALE:Ah, girls, it finally happened.
SUPFEMALE:The most wonderful thing happened to me at the drug store today.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Scholl was there in person, and I missed it.
LEADMALE:Rose, get new heroes.
LEADFEMALE:I am going to be a model.
SUPFEMALE:There I was, sitting at the lunch counter, and just like Miss Lana Turner, I was discovered.
LEADFEMALE:Well, not exactly like Miss Lana Turner.
LEADFEMALE:You mean she was sipping a soda and you were scarfing down your usual lumberjack breakfast.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Rose.
OTHERMALE:Silly, silly, water-retaining Rose.
SUPFEMALE:She was discovered for the movies.
LEADFEMALE:I was discovered by a print ad photographer, and the shoot's today.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, haven't you had enough problems with photographers? Remember the last time? Sure, the pictures turned out fine, but it cost your friend his party's nomination.
SUPMALE:Well I checked this guy out.
LEADMALE:He's a pro.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, imagine my face gracing the pages of Miami's biggest PennySaver.
LEADMALE:Blanche, all this commotion over a PennySaver? Well, I know it isn't exactly Vogue, but it is delivered with every daily in Miami.
LEADMALE:Oh, girls, what a glorious day.
LEADFEMALE:I just feel so pretty and alive and young as a teenager.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that's terrific.
SUPMALE:By the way, you got a phone call this morning from your grandson.
SUPMALE:He got his driver's license.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, look at this place.
LEADFEMALE:It's lovely.
LEADFEMALE:Don't get any ideas, Pussycat.
LEADMALE:I'm not getting any ideas, Ma.
SUPMALE:You're scheming.
LEADMALE:Remember Shady Pines, Dorothy? "Honest, Ma, this is the way to the new Dairy Queen.
SUPMALE:" Ms.
LEADFEMALE:Zbornak.
SUPMALE:Right on time.
OTHERMALE:Ah, Mr.
LEADMALE:Porter.
LEADMALE:I'd like you to meet your new activities director/n my mother Sophia Petrillo.
LEADFEMALE:Activities director? Surely you remember the conversation we had last/n Do this for me.
OTHERFEMALE:You promised.
LEADFEMALE:activities director? Oh, of course I remember.
LEADFEMALE:Nice meeting you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure you'll get along well with our, uh, our little gang.
OTHERMALE:Hi, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:I'm your new activities director.
SUPMALE:What's your name, honey? Sophia.
SUPMALE:Sophia, move it.
SUPFEMALE:You're blockin' the TV.
LEADMALE:Tough room.
LEADFEMALE:But don't worry, I'm highly qualified.
SUPMALE:By the way, what actually does an activities director do? Basically you'll pop in the video rental, be a fourth for bridge, a buddy.
OTHERMALE:If you do it well, we'll have trouble telling you from the other residents.
SUPFEMALE:I can do that.
LEADMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:If you need me, I'll be in my office.
OTHERMALE:Oh, by the way, couple things you should know.
SUPMALE:This is Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Lewis.
LEADFEMALE:He won't be any trouble.
SUPFEMALE:He's just sort of, uh, quiet.
SUPMALE:And, uh, that's Smokey.
SUPMALE:He fancies himself a ladies' man.
LEADFEMALE:Sort of the, uh, the rooster of our little henhouse.
LEADMALE:Whatever you do, don't dance with him.
LEADFEMALE:He'll put the moves on anybody.
LEADFEMALE:Smokey, I want you to meet my daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Ma! I have to go to work, and I don't want you to worry about me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to say to you what you said to me the very first day you dropped me off at school.
LEADFEMALE:"See if you can find someone who looks clean to drive you home.
LEADMALE:" I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:It just bothers me.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma.
LEADMALE:Cypress Grove has a great reputation.
OTHERMALE:Did you see the story they did about it on 60 Minutes? No.
LEADFEMALE:Short piece.
LEADFEMALE:It was just Mike Wallace saying, "Sorry I bothered you.
OTHERFEMALE:" But did you see them? Some of those people stayed in front of that TV for eight straight hours.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course, throw in a bag of cheese corn, and I just described your Saturday nights.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Porter had them resting, which is something you might want to try.
LEADMALE:I don't like this whole deal.
LEADFEMALE:Shady Pines/n now, there's a home.
SUPMALE:Luxury suites, tennis tournaments.
SUPFEMALE:Want a massage? Dial nine.
LEADMALE:And the food.
LEADFEMALE:The filet mignon Oh, really, Ma? Shady Pines had filet mignon? One.
LEADMALE:They'd throw it in the pit and make us fight for it.
OTHERFEMALE:What's wrong? I will tell you what's wrong.
LEADMALE:I took Rose here on my shoot today, and they want to use her hands.
SUPFEMALE:Imagine.
LEADFEMALE:They want to use my face but her hands.
OTHERMALE:Can you believe it? This is the most humiliating thing that's ever happened to me.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, how quickly you forget the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.
LEADMALE:Big deal.
LEADFEMALE:80,000 people had to wait 20 minutes.
LEADMALE:The torch eventually got there, didn't it? Blanche, I'm confused.
SUPMALE:So they want to use Rose's hands.
LEADFEMALE:What's the big deal? Yeah, Blanche, so what? So life threw the dumb country girl a crumb for once.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you're sexy and beautiful all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Let's face it.
LEADFEMALE:You have Bette Davis eyes and Freddie Krueger hands.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I have had it with you.
LEADMALE:I'm going to my room, and I may never come out.
LEADMALE:Is it the weekend already? Afternoon, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:My, don't you look lovely today? Why, thank you.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:And don't you look, uh, beautiful, vivacious, exquisite and, uh, uh Let's see.
OTHERFEMALE:Breathtaking? Dorothy, you know, at some point I'm going to have to start questioning your sincerity.
LEADFEMALE:When we get to that point, I'll let you know.
LEADMALE:Can you believe it? I'm beginning to think Blanche is hung up on her looks.
OTHERMALE:Boy, you don't need lightning to strike you.
LEADMALE:No, thanks.
LEADMALE:Not again.
LEADMALE:Once was enough.
LEADFEMALE:An extra piece of the puzzle.
SUPFEMALE:I'm the one who should be excited.
SUPMALE:Imagine.
SUPMALE:These hands that once reached inside a chicken for a breech birth will soon grace the pages of a PennySaver.
LEADMALE:You've come a long way, baby.
SUPMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma, I'm glad you're here.
LEADFEMALE:I got a call from Mr.
LEADMALE:Porter.
OTHERMALE:He thinks you're pushing the folks at Cypress Grove too hard.
LEADFEMALE:Big deal.
LEADMALE:One little dance-till-you-drop marathon.
LEADMALE:It only took ten minutes.
SUPMALE:And what's this about their staying into the night doing homework? A lot of them sit around waiting for their kids to write.
SUPMALE:So I said, "Why don't you write to our lonely servicemen instead?" I mean, we older folks have to exercise our minds, too.
SUPFEMALE:And don't you forget it, Gloria.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, Gloria is your daughter in California.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, I-I knew that.
LEADFEMALE:A mere dramatization to make my point, uh, pal.
SUPMALE:Look, Ma, I know that you're excited about this job, but/n It's more than a job, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:"Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:" When I see them, I see me.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you understand? Of course I understand.
LEADMALE:I know that your heart's in the right place, but No "buts.
OTHERMALE:" I'm not going to sit here while people are forced to throw in the towel.
LEADFEMALE:Have you ever seen what happens to a person when their brain is allowed to disintegrate and their minds turn completely to mush? Hey, my middle finger's the longest.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Porter, I came as soon as I could.
SUPFEMALE:I'm glad you're here.
OTHERMALE:We've got a problem.
LEADFEMALE:It's your mother.
LEADFEMALE:What about her? I don't know where she is, where any of them are.
LEADMALE:She took some of our guests out for a walk six hours ago.
LEADFEMALE:Have you called the police? I'll tell them to be on the lookout for old people in Miami.
LEADFEMALE:There's a lead.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doin' here? Ma, where were you? You said you were taking them for a walk.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but we got halfway down the block, and Lucille said, "I want a cappuccino.
LEADMALE:" The only place I know to get a really good cappuccino is Hialeah.
SUPFEMALE:This is the final warning.
SUPMALE:I don't want anything like this happening again.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Porter, you hired me to do a job, and I'm gonna do it my way.
SUPFEMALE:OK, that's it.
LEADMALE:Charade's over.
SUPFEMALE:What's he talkin' about? Sophia, you're not the activities director.
LEADMALE:You're here because your daughter wanted us to keep an eye on you.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid we cannot do that anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Ms.
SUPMALE:Zbornak, please don't bring her back.
LEADFEMALE:Keep an eye on me? Is that true? Look, Ma, I'm not gonna lie to you.
SUPMALE:This man is a patient here.
LEADMALE:He could be dangerous.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's get out of here before he starts causing trouble.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy.
LEADMALE:OK, OK.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you needed looking after during the day when I wasn't around, and I knew you wouldn't agree to come here as a guest So you're saying that this whole activities director thing was a put-up job? Mostly his idea.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Ma I did it for your own good.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody bothered to consult me about what was for my own good.
OTHERFEMALE:So goodbye, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Porter.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Thank you both for making me look like an old fool.
LEADMALE:Ma, what are you doing? I'm recuperating.
LEADFEMALE:You're watching cartoons.
LEADMALE:That's what you wanted me to do at Cypress Grove.
LEADMALE:Besides, I like cartoons.
OTHERMALE:Cartoons don't lie.
LEADMALE:Ma, stop it.
OTHERFEMALE:Is there something I can get you from the kitchen? Tea would be fine.
SUPFEMALE:Tea doesn't lie.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Are you saying that you never stretched the truth with me? Those were harmless lies.
LEADMALE:"All first-grade girls wear men's shoes"? I put bows on them, didn't I? You do the best you can with a pair of brown Florsheims, and this is the thanks you get.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, it finally came/n the advance copy of our PennySaver ad.
OTHERFEMALE:Bet my hands are better looking than your face.
LEADFEMALE:Bet my face is better looking than your hands.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, ladies, ladies, can't we settle this with pistols? Come on, open it.
SUPMALE:OK.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God! What's the matter, Blanche? Oh, my God! Oh, come on, no matter what/n Oh, my God! "Does your face look like this? "Do your hands look like this? You need Ponce de Leon Antiaging Cream.
LEADMALE:" I'd sue.
LEADMALE:Dorothy Zbornak, how could you? Oh, look, they have airbrushed liver spots all over us.
SUPFEMALE:Tell me about it.
OTHERMALE:You guys look like you should be barking on the front seat of a fire engine.
LEADFEMALE:I really would sue.
SUPMALE:Oh, Rose, come here, sit down.
LEADFEMALE:I just got off the phone with the PennySaver.
LEADMALE:Now, I think I have an idea, OK? They have six delivery trucks.
LEADMALE:By sheer coincidence, I know two of the drivers.
LEADMALE:I'm not worried about them.
LEADMALE:They won't show my picture if I don't show theirs.
OTHERMALE:Now, as I see it, of the four remaining drivers, only Agnes is a real problem.
SUPFEMALE:Now, Rose, here's a part of the plan you may not like.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, did you and Sophia patch things up? Ah, she's in her room, napping.
SUPMALE:You know, it's so ironic.
OTHERFEMALE:I sent her to that home, and there she was vital and happy.
LEADFEMALE:Now she's here, and, yes, she's resting, but she's behaving like those people at Cypress Grove/n camping in front of the TV all day.
LEADMALE:Poor woman.
SUPMALE:Do you know what I think the worst part of getting older is? Your face? Rose's hands? No.
LEADFEMALE:I think the worst part about getting older is that overwhelming sense of, "Where did the time go?" Was it really that long ago I was just a little girl? Oh, why guess? Lift up your chin, and we'll count the rings.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I was about to share with you a significant memory from my youth.
LEADMALE:It was the evening my mother gave birth to Clayton.
LEADMALE:In the spirit of the happy occasion, Big Daddy and a few of his cronies tied one on and went carousing through the streets of Atlanta, looking for some trouble.
LEADMALE:Just then, as luck would have it, who rounded the corner but two smart-mouthed New York lawyers.
SUPFEMALE:So, one thing led to another, and, well, Big Daddy and his friends ended up sort of skimming them across Higgins Pond.
LEADMALE:It was all in good fun.
LEADFEMALE:Least that was their defense.
LEADMALE:Anyway, that was the night prohibition started.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, prohibition started in the '20s.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I meant probation.
LEADMALE:Big Daddy went on probation.
OTHERMALE:And, uh, the point of this sordid song of the South? Just that sometimes a daughter has to look after her own parent, as unnatural as that may feel.
OTHERMALE:Well, it wasn't unnatural in St.
SUPFEMALE:Olaf.
SUPMALE:We not only took care of our old people, we revered them, honored them, put them on a pedestal.
SUPMALE:'Course, that's how we got to be the broken hip capital of the Midwest.
SUPFEMALE:That's a beautiful story, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Very inspirational.
SUPMALE:Now we have to stop those PennySavers.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go see if we can get your hair greased back and find you a flannel shirt.
SUPMALE:Oh, great, great party, Sophia, but where's the junk food? I've got a great idea for free pizza.
SUPFEMALE:Let's call up that 30-minute pizza place, tell them we're a bunch of college kids, and when the guy gets here, one of us grandmas will open the door and say, "What took you so long?"  Oh, it's great to have you back, Sophia.
SUPMALE:It's good to be back.
LEADFEMALE:I was getting tired of sitting home and feeling sorry for myself.
LEADFEMALE:They may not have wanted an activities director here, but they've got one.
LEADMALE:So what do you say? Let's get active.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mr.
LEADMALE:Lewis, would you like to dance? Oh, I can see you've had lessons.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, everybody, it's 10:00.
OTHERMALE:Do you care where your children are?  No! Oh, Blanche, there you are.
LEADMALE:Where have you been? My plan with the truck drivers didn't work, thanks to Little Miss Strait-laced here, so I have been in every front yard in a six-block radius gettin' these PennySavers from the paperboys.
LEADFEMALE:She was a woman possessed, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Caught some on the fly, scaled a couple of roofs.
LEADMALE:And she had a brilliant idea how to avoid guard dogs.
LEADMALE:You made her wear lamb chops again, didn't you? It's not like they slow her down.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, have you seen my mother?  No.
LEADFEMALE:I can't find her.
LEADMALE:She's gone.
SUPFEMALE:I ducked my head in her bedroom.
SUPMALE:She's not th- That's it! She never does what I tell her to do.
LEADMALE:It doesn't take a genius to figure out where she is.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:It's true on both hands.
SUPFEMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:You put your right foot in Come on, get 'em in.
SUPMALE:Get 'em in.
LEADFEMALE:You take your right foot out Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:You put your right foot in and/n Hurry up, or we'll never get to the part where you shake it all about on purpose.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, God.
OTHERFEMALE:They got into the medication.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, what do you think you're doing? Oh, look who's here.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody remembers my daughter Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Or maybe you know her by her Indian name, "Dances With Nobody.
SUPMALE:" Ma, come home.
LEADMALE:I'll come home when I'm good and ready.
SUPMALE:Ma, you have been sick, and I know what's best for you.
LEADMALE:Now, I'm taking you home, and nothing is going to stop me.
LEADFEMALE:Damn it.
SUPFEMALE:I should've known it was you.
LEADMALE:Please, Mr.
LEADMALE:Porter.
LEADMALE:I can handle her.
OTHERFEMALE:You haven't been able to so far.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I can handle her.
LEADFEMALE:Who are you having a problem with? You.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, perfect.
SUPFEMALE:I know my every move.
OTHERMALE:These people are up way too late.
LEADMALE:This party's over.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody back to bed.
LEADMALE:I danced tonight.
LEADFEMALE:First time in 25 years.
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Lewis, you can speak.
LEADMALE:How come you haven't spoken before? No one was listening.
LEADFEMALE:Not until you got here.
LEADFEMALE:I've been here.
LEADFEMALE:Could've spoken to me.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like you.
SUPMALE:Don't you see, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Porter, you're not listening to these people.
LEADMALE:You're only as old as you feel, and you're making them feel old.
LEADMALE:And, Pussycat, you make me feel old, too, like I can't make my own choices.
SUPMALE:Ma, I worry about you, and everything I did here, well, Ma it's because I'm afraid of losing you.
LEADMALE:I understand that, but, Pussycat, give me air.
LEADFEMALE:I know you love me, but maybe we can make decisions about me together.
LEADMALE:Yes, Ma, we will.
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's unspeakable, that's what it is.
OTHERFEMALE:Absolutely unspeakable.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, are you pretending you just found your first gray hair again? Dorothy, just because you have to walk around lookin' like an English lawyer doesn't mean everybody has to.
LEADMALE:For your information, I'm upset because I had a date, and he canceled.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Was it anybody special? Well, that's not the point.
LEADFEMALE:He might have taken me someplace where I'd meet someone who is.
OTHERMALE:You know, it's amazing.
OTHERMALE:Beneath that thin veneer of superficiality, somehow, miraculously, there is another even thinner veneer.
SUPFEMALE:What am I gonna do? What on God's green earth am I gonna do? You can stay home tonight.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna watch one of those John Bradshaw specials on PBS.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, we're gonna see if we can't get Dorothy's inner child to shut up.
LEADMALE:Good luck.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call Mel Bushman.
LEADMALE:Of course.
SUPMALE:Mel Bushman.
OTHERMALE:Old reliable.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Backup.
LEADFEMALE:How long has it been? What, three years that the two of you have been insignificant others? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yes, it has been.
OTHERFEMALE:Mel and I have something really unique.
LEADMALE:We're like/n I don't know.
OTHERMALE:What do you call it when two people get together when they need somebody but don't make demands on each other when they're apart? Out-call massage.
LEADFEMALE:That's odd.
LEADFEMALE:He's usually home by now.
LEADMALE:Well, he is the zipper king.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe he got stuck in traffic.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha-ha! Tell me the truth.
OTHERFEMALE:Do these glasses make me look stupid? Let's just say they don't hide it.
LEADFEMALE:The consumer show asked me to test these chemically treated lenses.
LEADMALE:The theory is they don't fog up when you come in from the cold.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, you wanna run that looking stupid question by us again? I'm just doing my job.
LEADMALE:Rose, leave the glasses in the refrigerator, close the door and keep your head out here with us.
SUPFEMALE:How will I know if they fog up? The little man who lives in there who turns the light on and off, he'll tell you.
OTHERMALE:I'm not in the mood for jokes, especially about the little man.
LEADMALE:You know he scares me.
OTHERMALE:It's really been hitting me lately.
OTHERFEMALE:Everybody's job down at the TV station is exciting but mine.
OTHERMALE:Well, then why not look for a more challenging position? I did hear something about an opening for a weekend news reporter.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what am I talking about? I don't have any experience.
LEADFEMALE:You don't need experience.
LEADFEMALE:You've got the one thing every TV reporter needs/n hair that doesn't move.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, Sophia, I told the news director I was interested in the reporter's position, and guess what he did.
SUPMALE:A Danny Thomas spit-take? No, he's giving me an actual news story to cover as an audition.
LEADFEMALE:So I was hoping you could help me get comfortable on camera so I'll be ready when he gives me my assignment.
LEADMALE:You know, Rose, that's not a bad idea.
OTHERFEMALE:This'll be the camera, and let me see you interview Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Not me, not me Oh, Dorothy, please.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not good at this.
SUPFEMALE:This is a pretend microphone.
LEADFEMALE:It's really just a hairbrush.
SUPFEMALE:All right, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Ready? Go! This is Rose Nylund.
LEADFEMALE:We're here chatting with my good friend Dorothy Zbornak.
LEADMALE:Welcome, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:It's a pleasure to be here.
OTHERMALE:So, can you tell me what it/n Oh.
SUPFEMALE:So tell me, Dorothy, what's it like being a substitute teacher? Rose, honey, excuse me, but I think you should take another tack.
OTHERMALE:I'm not saying that my job is boring Say it, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Say it.
OTHERFEMALE:No, I just feel you should ask more probing questions.
SUPMALE:Okey-dokey.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't it a fact that you have a drawer full of retirement home brochures and you're just waiting for the first sign of dribble on your mother's chin to lock her away forever?  She/n She's kidding.
SUPMALE:Your sock drawer, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:You know, the/n the one you-know-who can't reach? I knew you were keeping pictures there, but I had no idea.
LEADFEMALE:You disgust me.
SUPMALE:Look, I don't have to stand for this.
LEADFEMALE:Nail her, Rose.
LEADMALE:Nail her.
SUPFEMALE:Remember, a good reporter always gets her story, no matter what.
SUPFEMALE:That sock drawer is my business.
LEADFEMALE:Look, those times that Ma makes me crazy, I go into my room and have some pretend time, OK? This is Rose Nylund signing off in a sad, sad situation.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:That was fun.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, I do not know what I'm gonna do.
OTHERMALE:I called Mel all last night and all of today.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't gotten through to him yet.
LEADMALE:Oh, the nerve.
LEADFEMALE:If you wind up having to read a book because of that man Where can he be? He never leaves the house, not even for me.
LEADFEMALE:What is this Bushman-ia all of a sudden? This is a man you see, what, five times a year? A man you yourself describe as "Fred Flintstone with a better car.
LEADMALE:" Well, I may say things like that, but the truth is Mel makes me feel young and beautiful and special.
LEADFEMALE:When we're together, we laugh a lot.
SUPFEMALE:Why wouldn't you? You're both naked.
LEADFEMALE:There's more to Mel and me than just the physical, Sophia.
LEADMALE:We share things.
LEADMALE:I couldn't be intimate with just anybody.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? What about the guy who painted our address on the curb? You make it sound like it was a one-night stand.
LEADMALE:He'll be back when it's faded.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, Mel's probably just busy with work, not answering the phone.
SUPMALE:You'll reach him.
OTHERFEMALE:You always do.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy's right.
OTHERFEMALE:You're worrying for nothing.
OTHERMALE:I remember back in St.
SUPMALE:Ol- Hold it right there, Will Rogers.
SUPFEMALE:None of us is in the mood to hear one of those St.
OTHERMALE:Olaf stories.
LEADMALE:Well, then, here's one against your will.
LEADMALE:But to show you I'm a good sport, I'll get right to the part that'll make Blanche feel better.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway everybody in the village hated Ingmar.
SUPMALE:So we grabbed our torches and climbed the hill to his castle and pounded on the great oak door, but there was no answer.
SUPMALE:So we got a ladder, climbed up to the window, and we peeked in, and to our relief, there was Ingmar lying on the/n Oh, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:He was dead.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God, Dorothy, what if she's right? What if something's happened to Mel? Good going, Rose.
SUPMALE:Girls, I'm frightened.
LEADFEMALE:You gotta go with me.
SUPFEMALE:I gotta go check on Mel.
LEADMALE:Oh, of course, honey.
LEADMALE:But I'm telling you, you have nothing to worry about.
OTHERFEMALE:Way to go, Rose.
LEADMALE:I thought you said that story would help.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it did.
SUPMALE:You don't know how long I've been waiting to get that one off my chest.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:There must be two weeks' worth of papers here.
LEADMALE:Now calm down honey.
LEADMALE:This doesn't say "dead.
SUPFEMALE:" It says OK, let's get this over with.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe we better think this over.
LEADMALE:We don't have any right to go breaking into somebody's home.
LEADMALE:We're not breaking in.
LEADMALE:I have a key.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's see.
OTHERFEMALE:"Baldwin," "Baxter" Ah, here it is.
LEADMALE:"Bushman.
SUPMALE:" No.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's Al Bushman.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:"Mel Bushman.
SUPMALE:" You know, girls, I've been thinkin'.
LEADMALE:Ever since Mel and I met, I always figured he'd be around when I needed him, but I never thought about his needs.
LEADMALE:All I cared about were mine.
SUPMALE:I just always figured he'd be available, and he was.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, girls, he's always been there for me.
LEADFEMALE:I just took him for granted.
SUPMALE:Oh, honey, honey, don't do this to yourself.
LEADFEMALE:You take everyone for granted.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Well, so far nothing seems out of place.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this Exercycle.
LEADMALE:It's never been used.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, we've been on it.
SUPFEMALE:Don't ask, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, look.
LEADFEMALE:The zipper king's one millionth zipper.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh.
SUPMALE:I will never be able to look at another zipper without thinkin' of Mel.
LEADFEMALE:Let it go, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Let it go.
LEADFEMALE:Mel, is that really you?! No, it's Claus Von Bulow.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mel, it's great to see you.
LEADMALE:Blanche thought you were dead.
OTHERMALE:She did? I love it.
OTHERMALE:What makes you think something could kill Mel Bushman? Where have you been? I was on a vacation.
LEADFEMALE:What's the big deal? What made you think I was dead? If Mel Bushman doesn't answer my call, then something must be wrong.
SUPMALE:You weren't there when I needed you.
OTHERFEMALE:You're always there when I need you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, when you deliver such services, every once in a while, a man's gotta take a vacation.
LEADMALE:All that matters now is you're alive.
LEADMALE:You're alive, and we're together, and I'm never gonna let you go.
LEADMALE:Tell me she's being dramatic.
LEADFEMALE:When I thought I would never see you again, I began to realize just how much you meant to me and how much I've taken you for granted and how many things I never had a chance to say to you.
OTHERMALE:What I'm trying to say is I realize how much you mean to me and that I don't need anybody else.
OTHERMALE:I wanna be a one-man woman, and you're it.
SUPMALE:Mel Bushman, I love you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm all ready for my big date.
OTHERFEMALE:What big date? You're going out with Mel Bushman.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Isn't it wonderful? Tonight, Mel and I are starting a brand-new relationship.
LEADFEMALE:Do you realize how rare it is to find out the person you've been sleeping with is the person you love? No, but you can't go by me.
LEADMALE:I have morals.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Girls, great news.
OTHERFEMALE:I got my assignment, and it's a biggie.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, a biggie.
LEADMALE:Real big.
SUPMALE:Big, big, big.
LEADMALE:Cat show? Dog show.
LEADFEMALE:Miami's 13th annual.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's right, ladies.
LEADMALE:This afternoon, I'm gonna get the scoop on man's best friend.
LEADMALE:Oh, congratulations, honey.
LEADMALE:I know you're gonna do a great job.
LEADMALE:Oh, I just wish my mother and father were here to see this.
SUPFEMALE:Because they'd be so proud of you? No, because they'd be alive.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! My God, I've got goose bumps.
SUPMALE:Mel will be here any minute.
LEADMALE:Why are you so jumpy? You've been out with Mel a thousand times.
LEADMALE:I know, but now there's more at stake.
OTHERFEMALE:Everything's changed.
SUPMALE:It's all new and exciting.
LEADFEMALE:In many ways, I feel just the way I felt when I was a virgin.
SUPFEMALE:You mean, the feeling isn't gonna last long? Are you implying I lost my virginity at an early age? I'm just saying you're lucky Jack and Jill magazine didn't have a gossip column.
LEADFEMALE:Ma! Please, Pussycat, I'm on a roll.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Sophia, but I am not gonna let your skepticism ruin my entire evening.
LEADFEMALE:Mel and I were meant to be together.
LEADFEMALE:I wish I could say the same for your thighs.
LEADMALE:God, I'm hot tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not gonna stand for this.
LEADFEMALE:Take it, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:But I'll bet you'll lay down for it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that was just plain rude.
LEADFEMALE:Some people just don't know when to quit.
OTHERMALE:Look how they pamper these dogs.
OTHERMALE:They eat when they want to, sleep when they want to, go to the bathroom anywhere they/n Hey, I do have it pretty good.
LEADMALE:Now, if I could just get you to crack the window when you lock me in the car Ma, stop it.
SUPMALE:Now, I want you to behave yourself.
LEADMALE:We're here to give Rose moral support on her big day, and I don't want you doing or saying anything to embarrass her.
SUPMALE:Hi, girls.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, Rose.
LEADMALE:This is Andy.
OTHERFEMALE:He's my cameraman.
SUPFEMALE:Andy, these are my friends.
SUPFEMALE:Where do you think we should set up? I'm not sure, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Nylund.
LEADMALE:To tell you the truth, this is my audition, too.
SUPMALE:How about over there? Whatever you say.
SUPFEMALE:Whatever you say.
LEADMALE:The blind videotaping the blind.
SUPFEMALE:Here goes.
OTHERFEMALE:And we're rolling.
OTHERFEMALE:We're here at the 13th annual Miami Pet Dog Expo, where you're going/n All right, everybody, hands up! All right, you, behind the desk, I want the cash.
LEADMALE:Everyone else, I want wallets and jewelry! Move it! For God's sake, we've gotta do something.
LEADFEMALE:But he's got a gun.
LEADFEMALE:What are we gonna do? I'm gonna do the only thing a good reporter can do.
LEADMALE:Get the story no matter what.
LEADMALE:All right, now you just point your camera and do exactly as I say.
OTHERMALE:Give me the ring.
LEADMALE:Yes! Hurry up! This'll be far enough.
LEADMALE:Thanks very much for making this evening a total disaster.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart, give yourself some credit.
SUPMALE:It wouldn't have been a total disaster without you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh really, Mr.
LEADMALE:"No Guy With an Earring Parks My Car"? My God.
LEADMALE:You'd think an elegant restaurant like that would bring out the best in a man.
OTHERMALE:What it brought out was $250 from my wallet.
LEADMALE:It was a special occasion.
SUPMALE:Where I come from, $250 is 5 special occasions and a bottle of Scotch.
LEADFEMALE:You'd think for all that money, they'd hang a picture on the wall.
LEADMALE:The minimalist dÃ©cor is designed to enhance conversation.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing to look at, what's to talk about? I would think I would be enough.
SUPMALE:Talk about you? We didn't have to go out on a date to do that.
LEADFEMALE:You think I'm borin'? No, sweetheart, I think you're fantastic.
SUPMALE:With a guy like me, a little fantastic goes a long way.
SUPMALE:I mean, look what we got now.
LEADMALE:Every couple of weeks you call me when one of your boyfriends don't show up.
LEADMALE:I tell ya, "Bushman awaits.
SUPMALE:" We rent a movie, we order some takeout, we talk about you.
OTHERMALE:That's entertainment.
LEADFEMALE:I love that.
SUPMALE:And we cuddle.
OTHERFEMALE:Sometimes we do more than cuddle.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes you stay.
SUPMALE:That's the part I like the best/n when you stay.
OTHERFEMALE:Every couple of weeks, you bring a little class to Bushman's place.
SUPFEMALE:Why, Mel Bushman, are you sayin' you love me? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I love you.
SUPFEMALE:I love you the way we are now.
SUPFEMALE:But, sweetheart, you start with relationships and love, and I gotta put on a tie twice a week to eat food I can't even see I mean, we got a problem.
SUPFEMALE:I guess that without thinkin' about it, you've become a very comfortable part of my life.
LEADFEMALE:When I thought you were gone, suddenly life wasn't so comfortable anymore.
LEADFEMALE:I really missed you.
SUPFEMALE:Nah, you missed knowing Bushman awaits.
SUPFEMALE:Mm.
SUPMALE:Hey, I haven't spent this much time thinking about feelings since we rented the Alan Alda collection.
LEADFEMALE:Mel, I think it's pretty obvious our new relationship just isn't gonna work out.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think so.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't we call it off and go back to being friends? I got a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you come over to my place? I'm hungry.
LEADMALE:I'll go to Wolfie's, get some pastrami.
LEADMALE:We can rent Out of Africa.
SUPFEMALE:We've rented it five times and never made it through to the end.
SUPMALE:I know, but it always works.
SUPFEMALE:I do love you, Mel, as a friend.
LEADFEMALE:Like I said, sweetheart, you got a lot of class.
OTHERFEMALE:Life sucks.
OTHERMALE:Hi, Mel.
SUPMALE:You run on home, and I'll be over soon as I check on Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Bushman awaits.
LEADMALE:I didn't get it.
LEADFEMALE:What? I didn't get the job! Oh, Rose, your little dog show not go well? I'm so sorry.
OTHERMALE:Let's talk about me, then.
SUPMALE:Blanche, Rose did something absolutely incredible tonight.
SUPFEMALE:There was a robbery at the dog show.
SUPMALE:Ma and I were held hostage.
LEADFEMALE:Rose was the only reporter there.
LEADFEMALE:Well, shoot, I missed everything.
SUPMALE:Let's see the tape.
LEADMALE:OK.
SUPFEMALE:This is Rose Nylund for Channel 8 News here at the Miami Pet Dog Expo, and I am an eyewitness to something shocking  people who look like their dogs.
LEADFEMALE:I said keep quiet and don't move! That handsome fella you see back there with his hand in the air is Brian Kingsley of Boca Raton.
LEADMALE:With him is his best buddy Barney, a basset hound you'd swear was a member of his family.
LEADFEMALE:As we move closer, you'll notice Barney's collar matches Brian's Rolex.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think so far? I'm glad I wasn't there.
SUPMALE:TV does put 10 pounds on you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm here beneath the information table with Bill Peterson and his similarly profiled bulldog Churchill.
OTHERMALE:It's amazing.
LEADMALE:That bulldog could be your brother.
SUPFEMALE:But I guess you get that a lot.
OTHERMALE:Actually, I do.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, could we discuss this later? Wow.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thank you, Blanche, but there's more.
OTHERMALE:The police have just informed me that there was also a robbery by an unidentified man.
SUPFEMALE:Perhaps this little fella knows who he is.
SUPMALE:I did that last part after everything quieted down.
LEADFEMALE:I thought it would kinda tie things together.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:You didn't cover the robbery at all? Was I wrong again? I mean, I could have covered the holdup, but it would have seemed like I was giving in to sensationalism.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a reporter, damn it.
SUPFEMALE:They sent me to cover a story, and that's what I did.
SUPMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, this was the opportunity of a lifetime, a one-in-a-million shot.
OTHERMALE:How could/n How could/n How could they not have given you the job? Maybe the issue here is one of/n Oh, God, what can we call it? Editorial judgment.
LEADMALE:Really? You think so? Oh, yes, Rose.
LEADMALE:Yes, I do.
SUPMALE:I guess it just isn't the story they wanted.
LEADMALE:Damn, you're good.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:That makes me feel so much better.
SUPMALE:To tell you the truth, I'm still not ashamed of what I did today.
LEADMALE:If Deborah Norville stopped for every serious news story that happened around her, she wouldn't be where she is today.
LEADMALE:Well, Bushman awaits.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I learned something tonight.
SUPMALE:A relationship is more than sex and fun and videos and good times.
SUPMALE:Thank God this isn't a relationship.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Oh, morning, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, when was the last time you had sex? It's a very personal question.
SUPFEMALE:That long, huh? Perfect.
LEADMALE:Then you shall be the queen of the Festival of the Dancing Virgins.
LEADMALE:Ma, what are you talking about? Once a year, the women of my village threw a festival to recapture their virginity.
SUPMALE:It gives you a chance to say to the man in your life, "What kind of tramp do you take me for?" We had a Festival of the Dancing Virgins in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf, too.
SUPMALE:Every year, we'd go down to the lake, and they'd be flopping around on the dock.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, wait.
LEADMALE:That was the Festival of the Dancing Sturgeons.
SUPFEMALE:What is wrong with you, woman? OK, Queenie I have to make salsa grandioso again, and this time, I'm gonna teach you how.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Ma.
SUPMALE:Not the sauce, Ma, no.
LEADFEMALE:That takes weeks.
SUPFEMALE:There are 152 ingredients.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't have the time.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, for 1400 years, the women in our family have been handing this recipe down from mother to daughter.
LEADMALE:Each generation improves upon it in some way.
LEADFEMALE:Like, for instance, it was my great-grandmother who added heat.
SUPMALE:What did you add, Sophia? A mouthful of wine.
OTHERFEMALE:It was an accident.
SUPFEMALE:A delicious accident.
LEADMALE:Well, Ma, I just can't do it now.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna be teaching that honors program class, and it's going to be a challenge.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna have students who know that Chekhov is a brilliant Russian playwright, not the guy who was the navigator on the Enterprise.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know the guy from Star Trek wrote plays.
LEADFEMALE:So, what you're telling me is I'm gonna take this recipe with me to the grave.
LEADMALE:Right along with the secret of why Uncle Gino legally adopted that goat.
LEADMALE:Sophia, why don't you teach me the recipe? I'm practically a daughter.
LEADFEMALE:You have to hand it down to a blood relative or the queen of the festival.
LEADMALE:When was the last time you had sex? A couple of weeks ago.
LEADMALE:Let's not split hairs.
LEADMALE:Congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:You're the queen.
LEADMALE:I'm the quee-- I'm the queen? You're also the fool, so we're saving a lot on payroll.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, leave her alone.
OTHERFEMALE:We have to get to work on the sauce.
OTHERMALE:We begin by taking a shallow bath in olive oil at 7:34 Sicily time.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Originally it was to keep the Visigoths away.
OTHERMALE:But if ain't broke, don't fix it.
LEADMALE:Am I convincing? As what, ye olde towne slut? It so happens our community playhouse is doing The Taming of the Shrew, and I'm to audition for the role of Kate, the fiery tart of Padua who no man could tame.
LEADFEMALE:Hark.
OTHERMALE:Perhaps a suitor doth approacheth.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think he'll thtay all night? Rebecca, what a surprise.
SUPMALE:Look at you.
SUPMALE:And you used to yell at me for wearin' halter tops.
LEADFEMALE:Mama, I just got a job interview, and I really need you to baby-sit for Aurora.
LEADFEMALE:Aurora.
SUPMALE:I just hate that name.
LEADFEMALE:Why couldn't you have found something more musical, more/n more Southern, more beautiful? Sorry, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Look, I know you don't like the name, and I know you think I'm bringin' her up wrong.
LEADFEMALE:No, I just don't see why you have to feed her when you come to visit me at the museum.
SUPFEMALE:You don't see me taking out my breast in public.
OTHERFEMALE:A lot.
SUPFEMALE:I'd love to stay and argue with you, but I have to go.
LEADMALE:You know how much I wanna be with Oreo, but Aurora, Mama.
OTHERFEMALE:Aurora.
LEADFEMALE:I just have such a block against that name.
LEADFEMALE:Rebecca/n You promised if I moved to Miami you'd help me out, and I really need this job.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, here.
LEADMALE:You have a good time with Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Rebecca! Will you stop sayin' that? You keep callin' me "Grandma," she's gonna grow up to think that's my name.
LEADFEMALE:yours if you talk of tales, and so, farewell.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Would you like to see Kate another way? God, yes.
LEADMALE:Next! Blanche Devereaux.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Larry, is that you? No, Larry's not directing this one.
SUPFEMALE:He's sick.
LEADMALE:His back didn't go out again, did it? How did you know? I performed Annie for him.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Where? None of your business.
SUPFEMALE:OK.
LEADFEMALE:Jason will be your Petruchio, page 85.
LEADMALE:"Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.
LEADFEMALE:" "Moved? In good time, let him that moved you hither move you hence.
SUPFEMALE:"  All right, all right, all right.
OTHERMALE:"I knew you at the first.
LEADMALE:You were a moveable.
SUPMALE:" Thou hast hit it.
LEADMALE:Come, sit on me.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:"Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
OTHERMALE:"  Women are made to bear, and so are you.
OTHERFEMALE:Shh, shh, shh.
LEADFEMALE:"No such jade as m-- you if me you mean.
OTHERFEMALE:" OK.
LEADMALE:I've heard enough.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Oh, please.
LEADMALE:I've waited my whole life to play this part.
LEADFEMALE:Long wait.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Miss Devereaux.
SUPMALE:Let's take a five.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, shoot.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I thought you were great.
LEADMALE:Oh! Well, uh, I was born to act.
LEADMALE:I've given some of my best performances on the stage.
SUPFEMALE:And what about this little lady? I bet her daddy is very proud of her.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't have a daddy, do you, sweetheart? Really? Well, she has a very talented mother.
LEADMALE:How do you know? I just saw her act.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:And your name was? Jason Stillman.
SUPMALE:Did you happen to see Breakfast At Tiffany's? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I was in the party scene.
LEADMALE:Audrey Hepburn spilled a drink on me.
LEADFEMALE:But they cut it out.
LEADMALE:I'm impressed.
LEADFEMALE:I've settled here in Florida recently.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you and your daughter could join me for an afternoon at the zoo one day soon? My daughter and I would love that.
SUPMALE:I'll give you a call.
LEADMALE:Are you in the book? Bold print.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:How was school? Oh, I hate those smart kids.
LEADFEMALE:They may be our brightest, but they're also our rudest, considering most of them are guests in our country.
OTHERMALE:Oh, give me a class of red-blooded underachievers.
OTHERFEMALE:Pussycat, when you were in junior high school and the kids gave you a hard time, what did I say? You told me I was extra-special and they were just jealous.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, and if they still gave you a hard time, what did I tell you to say? "My mother can have you eliminated with one phone call.
LEADFEMALE:" But, Ma, this is different.
LEADMALE:I've always wanted to teach an honors class, but now that I am, well, the kids are making me feel stupid.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, I'm gonna tell you something I never told you before.
LEADFEMALE:When you were about 12 and we lived in Brooklyn, they called me into the school to tell me you had the highest IQ in the borough.
OTHERMALE:That's a coincidence.
LEADMALE:I was told I had the IQ of a burro.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, I had no ide-- The brightest kid in Brooklyn? Well, that certainly explains the feeling of being right all the time.
LEADFEMALE:What is it? I don't know if you know this, but a burro can find its way back home.
OTHERFEMALE:Have fun shopping, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'll be back.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, what crossword puzzle are you doing? Sunday New York Times'.
OTHERFEMALE:In ink.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't Rebecca here with the baby yet? She called and said she'd be a little late.
OTHERMALE:You know, Blanche, it's so nice to see you take this much of an interest in your granddaughter.
LEADMALE:Well, I have to.
LEADFEMALE:Jason thinks the baby's mine.
SUPMALE:Well, don't look at me that way.
LEADMALE:He thought the baby was mine.
LEADFEMALE:I just didn't correct him.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not a lie.
LEADMALE:I'm-I'm just withholding the truth.
LEADMALE:Blanche, how could you do that? Because over the past couple of weeks, I've really gotten to like him.
LEADFEMALE:If I go back now and tell him the truth, he'll think I'm a liar.
OTHERMALE:Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to tell a fib.
SUPFEMALE:Walt Whitman here has a point.
LEADFEMALE:What's with this guy? He must be blind as a bat.
OTHERFEMALE:There are lots of ways you can trick a man into thinkin' you're younger than you really are.
SUPFEMALE:You wear sunglasses, put on a little extra makeup, go to dimly lit restaurants.
LEADMALE:We've all done that.
SUPFEMALE:Fly to Nevada to get a fake birth certificate.
LEADFEMALE:Have a phony high school yearbook printed up.
LEADMALE:Change the dates on your parents' graves.
SUPMALE:We've all done that.
OTHERMALE:Wonder if that's Jason.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, I'm warnin' you, if anybody blows the whistle on me, the old lady's out on the street.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, go in the other room and cry like a baby.
LEADMALE:Get.
LEADFEMALE:Go! Move it.
LEADFEMALE:She owns us.
SUPFEMALE:Jason.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche.
LEADMALE:I really wanna thank you again for these ray blockers.
LEADMALE:I didn't think I'd get used to everything being pink, but it's kinda fun.
SUPMALE:I guess we oughta be on our way.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, Alligator Grotto has been there a thousand years.
LEADMALE:It can wait another few minutes.
LEADMALE:Good afternoon, ladies.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you take the glasses off and stay a while? Yoo-hoo, gotta go.
LEADFEMALE:Where's the baby? The baby's sleeping.
SUPFEMALE:Let me take a peek.
LEADMALE:At the Greater Miami Baby Sleep Center.
LEADMALE:It's sort of a flophouse for infants.
LEADMALE:Oh, that must be the baby and her nanny now.
OTHERMALE:Hi, everyone.
LEADMALE:Sorry I'm late, but you'll never guess what happened today.
SUPMALE:Tell me later.
LEADFEMALE:Give me the baby and leave.
SUPFEMALE:She said, "Mama.
LEADMALE:" Ah.
SUPMALE:Too bad, Blanche, that you weren't there.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, too bad, but I'm sure she'll say it again.
SUPMALE:OK, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Let me get a picture.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't she the most beautiful mother you've ever seen? Grand, just grand.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Blanche, this is like a perfect family.
SUPFEMALE:Well, almost perfect.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe someday there'll be room for me.
SUPFEMALE:And who knows maybe even a little one of our own.
SUPMALE:And a pinch of red pepper That's not a pinch.
LEADFEMALE:Did you ever get pinched by an Italian? It takes about five minutes.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doin' up? You have school tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm just too smart for my own good.
OTHERFEMALE:I feel as trapped and isolated as Soren Kierkegaard in his final days.
LEADMALE:What? That's such a funny name.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Rose, dear, sweet, single-digit-IQ Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I've been tossing and turnin'.
SUPMALE:I can't sleep.
LEADMALE:I don't know what I'm gonna do about Jason.
SUPMALE:He's reached a point in his life where he's anxious to settle down.
OTHERMALE:He wants us to have another child right away.
LEADMALE:Well, frankly, I don't know if I want another baby so soon.
SUPMALE:I understand.
LEADMALE:Wait a couple years, and Medicare will pay for it.
LEADFEMALE:Why wait? Have it now and The Enquirer will pay for it.
LEADMALE:It's so unfair.
LEADFEMALE:We're both about the same age, but he can go on makin' babies the rest of his life.
SUPMALE:I feel like the Spruce Goose.
SUPMALE:People may visit, play with the controls, but I'll never really fly again.
SUPFEMALE:Hello! And how is little Aurora doing today? Oh, what a good girl she was this mornin'.
SUPFEMALE:She was just smilin' and smilin' and smilin'.
LEADFEMALE:I know sometimes it's just gas, but she was so cute.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, it's not cute once you pass 80.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I thought I heard company.
SUPFEMALE:Come here, you.
SUPMALE:Aurora just got up, so you may not be able to put her down for a nap this afternoon.
OTHERFEMALE:That's all right.
LEADFEMALE:I enjoy it when she's awake.
LEADFEMALE:Mother, this is so unlike you.
LEADFEMALE:You've never really liked babies.
OTHERMALE:Rebecca, go home.
LEADMALE:You're interfering in my and the baby's bondin' time.
LEADFEMALE:Before I go, I just wanna say it's been wonderful seein' the open, honest and lovin' relationship you're havin' with Aurora.
OTHERFEMALE:You've been great.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, Mama.
SUPMALE:Wait.
SUPMALE:I'm not as perfect as you think I am.
LEADMALE:There's something you oughta know.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:I hope I'm not too early.
LEADFEMALE:You're right on time.
OTHERMALE:There's something I wanna tell you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not the baby's mother.
SUPMALE:I'm her grandmother.
SUPMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:I should have told you sooner, but when we first met, I was very attracted to you, and I couldn't believe you thought I was the baby's mother.
OTHERMALE:What were you thinkin' of? Well, I thought, "Who am I to judge?" I was bald at 23.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess this puts an end to our relationship.
LEADFEMALE:You probably don't want to go out with a grandmother.
SUPMALE:No, I'd-- I'd go out with a grandmother.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to go out with someone I can't trust.
SUPMALE:Goodbye, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Well, that's that.
SUPFEMALE:No use cryin'.
LEADFEMALE:Shall we take the baby to the park? Why? So you can pick someone else up? I really thought you were gettin' to love Aurora, but you were just usin' your granddaughter to try and land a man.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye, Mama.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for baby-sittin'.
OTHERMALE:You won't have to do it again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good, you're home for the Festival of the Dancing Virgins.
LEADFEMALE:The sauce is almost ready.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not staying for dinner tonight.
LEADMALE:There's a meeting at Mensa.
LEADMALE:That's the organization for people with high IQs like mine.
LEADFEMALE:You know, in St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf we had a chapter of Mensa, and across the room was Girlsa.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait, those were the bathrooms at St.
LEADMALE:Olaf's only Italian restaurant.
LEADMALE:Hold it, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Not stay for dinner? Not stay for the sauce? Miss the whole festival? Where's your sense of family, your sense of tradition? Ma, it's just that I want to be around my intellectual peers.
SUPFEMALE:I got bad news for you, Pussycat.
SUPFEMALE:You are.
LEADFEMALE:I made up your IQ.
LEADMALE:I wasn't the brightest kid in Brooklyn? So I lied.
LEADMALE:Did it help you get along with your honors class? Yes, but Ma, you lied to me.
LEADMALE:Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus, Easter Bunny.
LEADFEMALE:I've been messin' with your head for almost 60 years.
LEADFEMALE:I guess you don't feel like Sorten Kareerdybarten now.
OTHERFEMALE:That's Soren Kierkegaard.
LEADFEMALE:I got her to say it again.
LEADFEMALE:What's goin' on? Oh, good, trollop.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody grab a rock.
LEADMALE:Go on, throw 'em.
SUPMALE:I don't care anymore.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, you still that upset about Jason? I'm not upset about him.
LEADFEMALE:I would never get that upset about a man.
LEADFEMALE:Rebecca called, asked if she could come over and get the baby's things.
SUPMALE:I asked her if we could talk.
SUPFEMALE:She said we have nothin' to talk about.
SUPFEMALE:And we have so much to talk about.
LEADMALE:The trouble is, we always end up fightin'.
LEADMALE:Look who's here! Oh, Sophia, see if you can get them to stay for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:No, really, thank you.
LEADMALE:I just came by to pick up a few things.
LEADFEMALE:There's just plenty of food.
SUPMALE:Thank you anyway.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get the baby's things.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, it's 6:30.
LEADMALE:We're already five minutes behind schedule.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, before you bring in the sauce, tell us what ingredient you added.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to spoil the surprise.
SUPFEMALE:I'll give you a hint.
LEADMALE:They're sugary and they're grrrrreat! Dorothy, you're gonna have to do the Dance of the Virgins by yourself.
LEADMALE:Ma! You remember.
SUPFEMALE:It's like the bunny hop, except you keep your legs crossed.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, you're making this up.
SUPFEMALE:I'm adding to it.
LEADMALE:Once every year, the women of my family got together.
OTHERFEMALE:They danced, they laughed, they ate.
LEADMALE:It was a celebration of mothers and daughters.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't turn your back on your mother, Rebecca.
LEADFEMALE:Don't let your little girl grow up without a grandmother.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm 85, and I still cherish all the memories that I had with mine.
LEADMALE:I think I've got everything.
LEADMALE:Can I kiss Aurora goodbye? No.
LEADMALE:No? We're not goin' anywhere.
LEADMALE:Give me that baby.
LEADMALE:Ohh.
OTHERMALE:Ohh.
OTHERMALE:On with the feast.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma, I may not have an IQ of 173, but I know what you mean by continuity and family.
SUPMALE:And next year, I want to learn the sauce.
SUPMALE:Deal, Pussycat.
SUPMALE:It's not that hard.
LEADMALE:First you get one large pot, a dozen plump tomatoes and one moron to do all the work for you.
SUPMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh, morning, Ma.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, when was the last time you had sex? It's a very personal question.
LEADFEMALE:That long, huh? Perfect.
LEADFEMALE:Then you shall be the queen of the Festival of the Dancing Virgins.
LEADMALE:Ma, what are you talking about? Once a year, the women of my village threw a festival to recapture their virginity.
LEADMALE:It gives you a chance to say to the man in your life, "What kind of tramp do you take me for?" We had a Festival of the Dancing Virgins in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf, too.
OTHERMALE:Every year, we'd go down to the lake, and they'd be flopping around on the dock.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, wait.
SUPFEMALE:That was the Festival of the Dancing Sturgeons.
OTHERFEMALE:What is wrong with you, woman? OK, Queenie I have to make salsa grandioso again, and this time, I'm gonna teach you how.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Ma.
LEADMALE:Not the sauce, Ma, no.
LEADFEMALE:That takes weeks.
LEADFEMALE:There are 152 ingredients.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't have the time.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, for 1400 years, the women in our family have been handing this recipe down from mother to daughter.
LEADMALE:Each generation improves upon it in some way.
LEADFEMALE:Like, for instance, it was my great-grandmother who added heat.
LEADFEMALE:What did you add, Sophia? A mouthful of wine.
LEADFEMALE:It was an accident.
LEADMALE:A delicious accident.
LEADMALE:Well, Ma, I just can't do it now.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna be teaching that honors program class, and it's going to be a challenge.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna have students who know that Chekhov is a brilliant Russian playwright, not the guy who was the navigator on the Enterprise.
LEADMALE:I didn't know the guy from Star Trek wrote plays.
SUPMALE:So, what you're telling me is I'm gonna take this recipe with me to the grave.
LEADFEMALE:Right along with the secret of why Uncle Gino legally adopted that goat.
OTHERMALE:Sophia, why don't you teach me the recipe? I'm practically a daughter.
LEADFEMALE:You have to hand it down to a blood relative or the queen of the festival.
SUPFEMALE:When was the last time you had sex? A couple of weeks ago.
LEADMALE:Let's not split hairs.
LEADMALE:Congratulations.
SUPMALE:You're the queen.
SUPMALE:I'm the quee-- I'm the queen? You're also the fool, so we're saving a lot on payroll.
SUPMALE:Aw, leave her alone.
LEADMALE:We have to get to work on the sauce.
SUPFEMALE:We begin by taking a shallow bath in olive oil at 7:34 Sicily time.
SUPMALE:Why? Originally it was to keep the Visigoths away.
LEADMALE:But if ain't broke, don't fix it.
LEADMALE:Am I convincing? As what, ye olde towne slut? It so happens our community playhouse is doing The Taming of the Shrew, and I'm to audition for the role of Kate, the fiery tart of Padua who no man could tame.
OTHERFEMALE:Hark.
LEADMALE:Perhaps a suitor doth approacheth.
SUPMALE:Do you think he'll thtay all night? Rebecca, what a surprise.
LEADMALE:Look at you.
OTHERFEMALE:And you used to yell at me for wearin' halter tops.
LEADMALE:Mama, I just got a job interview, and I really need you to baby-sit for Aurora.
LEADMALE:Aurora.
OTHERMALE:I just hate that name.
LEADMALE:Why couldn't you have found something more musical, more/n more Southern, more beautiful? Sorry, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I know you don't like the name, and I know you think I'm bringin' her up wrong.
LEADMALE:No, I just don't see why you have to feed her when you come to visit me at the museum.
LEADMALE:You don't see me taking out my breast in public.
LEADFEMALE:A lot.
LEADMALE:I'd love to stay and argue with you, but I have to go.
OTHERMALE:You know how much I wanna be with Oreo, but Aurora, Mama.
SUPMALE:Aurora.
LEADMALE:I just have such a block against that name.
SUPFEMALE:Rebecca/n You promised if I moved to Miami you'd help me out, and I really need this job.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, here.
SUPMALE:You have a good time with Grandma.
SUPMALE:Rebecca! Will you stop sayin' that? You keep callin' me "Grandma," she's gonna grow up to think that's my name.
OTHERFEMALE:yours if you talk of tales, and so, farewell.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Would you like to see Kate another way? God, yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Next! Blanche Devereaux.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Larry, is that you? No, Larry's not directing this one.
LEADFEMALE:He's sick.
LEADFEMALE:His back didn't go out again, did it? How did you know? I performed Annie for him.
SUPMALE:Really? Where? None of your business.
LEADMALE:OK.
SUPFEMALE:Jason will be your Petruchio, page 85.
LEADMALE:"Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.
LEADMALE:" "Moved? In good time, let him that moved you hither move you hence.
OTHERMALE:"  All right, all right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:"I knew you at the first.
SUPFEMALE:You were a moveable.
SUPFEMALE:" Thou hast hit it.
OTHERFEMALE:Come, sit on me.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:"Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
SUPMALE:"  Women are made to bear, and so are you.
SUPMALE:Shh, shh, shh.
LEADFEMALE:"No such jade as m-- you if me you mean.
LEADFEMALE:" OK.
LEADFEMALE:I've heard enough.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Oh, please.
LEADMALE:I've waited my whole life to play this part.
LEADFEMALE:Long wait.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Miss Devereaux.
SUPFEMALE:Let's take a five.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, shoot.
OTHERMALE:Well, I thought you were great.
OTHERMALE:Oh! Well, uh, I was born to act.
SUPFEMALE:I've given some of my best performances on the stage.
OTHERFEMALE:And what about this little lady? I bet her daddy is very proud of her.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't have a daddy, do you, sweetheart? Really? Well, she has a very talented mother.
LEADFEMALE:How do you know? I just saw her act.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:And your name was? Jason Stillman.
LEADMALE:Did you happen to see Breakfast At Tiffany's? Yes.
OTHERMALE:Well, I was in the party scene.
LEADFEMALE:Audrey Hepburn spilled a drink on me.
LEADFEMALE:But they cut it out.
SUPMALE:I'm impressed.
SUPMALE:I've settled here in Florida recently.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you and your daughter could join me for an afternoon at the zoo one day soon? My daughter and I would love that.
LEADFEMALE:I'll give you a call.
SUPFEMALE:Are you in the book? Bold print.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Pussycat.
SUPFEMALE:How was school? Oh, I hate those smart kids.
LEADFEMALE:They may be our brightest, but they're also our rudest, considering most of them are guests in our country.
OTHERMALE:Oh, give me a class of red-blooded underachievers.
OTHERFEMALE:Pussycat, when you were in junior high school and the kids gave you a hard time, what did I say? You told me I was extra-special and they were just jealous.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right, and if they still gave you a hard time, what did I tell you to say? "My mother can have you eliminated with one phone call.
LEADFEMALE:" But, Ma, this is different.
SUPMALE:I've always wanted to teach an honors class, but now that I am, well, the kids are making me feel stupid.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, I'm gonna tell you something I never told you before.
LEADFEMALE:When you were about 12 and we lived in Brooklyn, they called me into the school to tell me you had the highest IQ in the borough.
LEADMALE:That's a coincidence.
LEADMALE:I was told I had the IQ of a burro.
SUPMALE:Ma, I had no ide-- The brightest kid in Brooklyn? Well, that certainly explains the feeling of being right all the time.
LEADFEMALE:What is it? I don't know if you know this, but a burro can find its way back home.
LEADMALE:Have fun shopping, Rose.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'll be back.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dorothy, what crossword puzzle are you doing? Sunday New York Times'.
LEADFEMALE:In ink.
LEADMALE:Isn't Rebecca here with the baby yet? She called and said she'd be a little late.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Blanche, it's so nice to see you take this much of an interest in your granddaughter.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I have to.
LEADMALE:Jason thinks the baby's mine.
LEADMALE:Well, don't look at me that way.
OTHERFEMALE:He thought the baby was mine.
SUPFEMALE:I just didn't correct him.
LEADMALE:It's not a lie.
LEADMALE:I'm-I'm just withholding the truth.
LEADMALE:Blanche, how could you do that? Because over the past couple of weeks, I've really gotten to like him.
LEADMALE:If I go back now and tell him the truth, he'll think I'm a liar.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to tell a fib.
SUPFEMALE:Walt Whitman here has a point.
SUPMALE:What's with this guy? He must be blind as a bat.
LEADFEMALE:There are lots of ways you can trick a man into thinkin' you're younger than you really are.
LEADFEMALE:You wear sunglasses, put on a little extra makeup, go to dimly lit restaurants.
LEADMALE:We've all done that.
LEADMALE:Fly to Nevada to get a fake birth certificate.
SUPMALE:Have a phony high school yearbook printed up.
LEADFEMALE:Change the dates on your parents' graves.
LEADMALE:We've all done that.
LEADFEMALE:Wonder if that's Jason.
OTHERMALE:Listen, I'm warnin' you, if anybody blows the whistle on me, the old lady's out on the street.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, go in the other room and cry like a baby.
SUPFEMALE:Get.
SUPMALE:Go! Move it.
LEADFEMALE:She owns us.
SUPMALE:Jason.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I really wanna thank you again for these ray blockers.
LEADMALE:I didn't think I'd get used to everything being pink, but it's kinda fun.
LEADMALE:I guess we oughta be on our way.
SUPMALE:Honey, Alligator Grotto has been there a thousand years.
SUPMALE:It can wait another few minutes.
OTHERFEMALE:Good afternoon, ladies.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you take the glasses off and stay a while? Yoo-hoo, gotta go.
LEADMALE:Where's the baby? The baby's sleeping.
LEADFEMALE:Let me take a peek.
SUPFEMALE:At the Greater Miami Baby Sleep Center.
LEADFEMALE:It's sort of a flophouse for infants.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that must be the baby and her nanny now.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, everyone.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry I'm late, but you'll never guess what happened today.
LEADMALE:Tell me later.
LEADMALE:Give me the baby and leave.
SUPMALE:She said, "Mama.
SUPMALE:" Ah.
SUPFEMALE:Too bad, Blanche, that you weren't there.
SUPMALE:Yeah, too bad, but I'm sure she'll say it again.
LEADFEMALE:OK, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me get a picture.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't she the most beautiful mother you've ever seen? Grand, just grand.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Blanche, this is like a perfect family.
LEADMALE:Well, almost perfect.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe someday there'll be room for me.
OTHERFEMALE:And who knows maybe even a little one of our own.
SUPMALE:And a pinch of red pepper That's not a pinch.
LEADFEMALE:Did you ever get pinched by an Italian? It takes about five minutes.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doin' up? You have school tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm just too smart for my own good.
LEADFEMALE:I feel as trapped and isolated as Soren Kierkegaard in his final days.
LEADFEMALE:What? That's such a funny name.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose, dear, sweet, single-digit-IQ Rose.
LEADMALE:Oh, I've been tossing and turnin'.
SUPMALE:I can't sleep.
OTHERMALE:I don't know what I'm gonna do about Jason.
LEADFEMALE:He's reached a point in his life where he's anxious to settle down.
LEADFEMALE:He wants us to have another child right away.
LEADFEMALE:Well, frankly, I don't know if I want another baby so soon.
LEADFEMALE:I understand.
LEADMALE:Wait a couple years, and Medicare will pay for it.
LEADFEMALE:Why wait? Have it now and The Enquirer will pay for it.
SUPFEMALE:It's so unfair.
OTHERMALE:We're both about the same age, but he can go on makin' babies the rest of his life.
LEADMALE:I feel like the Spruce Goose.
SUPMALE:People may visit, play with the controls, but I'll never really fly again.
LEADMALE:Hello! And how is little Aurora doing today? Oh, what a good girl she was this mornin'.
SUPMALE:She was just smilin' and smilin' and smilin'.
SUPMALE:I know sometimes it's just gas, but she was so cute.
LEADMALE:Ma, it's not cute once you pass 80.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I thought I heard company.
SUPMALE:Come here, you.
LEADFEMALE:Aurora just got up, so you may not be able to put her down for a nap this afternoon.
LEADMALE:That's all right.
LEADMALE:I enjoy it when she's awake.
SUPFEMALE:Mother, this is so unlike you.
SUPFEMALE:You've never really liked babies.
OTHERFEMALE:Rebecca, go home.
SUPFEMALE:You're interfering in my and the baby's bondin' time.
LEADMALE:Before I go, I just wanna say it's been wonderful seein' the open, honest and lovin' relationship you're havin' with Aurora.
LEADFEMALE:You've been great.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, Mama.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait.
SUPMALE:I'm not as perfect as you think I am.
LEADMALE:There's something you oughta know.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:I hope I'm not too early.
LEADFEMALE:You're right on time.
LEADFEMALE:There's something I wanna tell you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not the baby's mother.
SUPMALE:I'm her grandmother.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADMALE:I should have told you sooner, but when we first met, I was very attracted to you, and I couldn't believe you thought I was the baby's mother.
SUPMALE:What were you thinkin' of? Well, I thought, "Who am I to judge?" I was bald at 23.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess this puts an end to our relationship.
LEADMALE:You probably don't want to go out with a grandmother.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'd-- I'd go out with a grandmother.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to go out with someone I can't trust.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's that.
SUPFEMALE:No use cryin'.
SUPMALE:Shall we take the baby to the park? Why? So you can pick someone else up? I really thought you were gettin' to love Aurora, but you were just usin' your granddaughter to try and land a man.
OTHERMALE:Goodbye, Mama.
SUPMALE:Thanks for baby-sittin'.
LEADFEMALE:You won't have to do it again.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, good, you're home for the Festival of the Dancing Virgins.
LEADMALE:The sauce is almost ready.
SUPMALE:I'm not staying for dinner tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:There's a meeting at Mensa.
LEADFEMALE:That's the organization for people with high IQs like mine.
LEADFEMALE:You know, in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf we had a chapter of Mensa, and across the room was Girlsa.
SUPFEMALE:No, wait, those were the bathrooms at St.
OTHERMALE:Olaf's only Italian restaurant.
SUPFEMALE:Hold it, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Not stay for dinner? Not stay for the sauce? Miss the whole festival? Where's your sense of family, your sense of tradition? Ma, it's just that I want to be around my intellectual peers.

LEADMALE:I got her to say it again.
OTHERFEMALE:What's goin' on? Oh, good, trollop.
LEADMALE:Everybody grab a rock.
LEADFEMALE:Go on, throw 'em.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care anymore.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, you still that upset about Jason? I'm not upset about him.
LEADMALE:I would never get that upset about a man.
SUPMALE:Rebecca called, asked if she could come over and get the baby's things.
LEADFEMALE:I asked her if we could talk.
LEADMALE:She said we have nothin' to talk about.
LEADFEMALE:And we have so much to talk about.
OTHERFEMALE:The trouble is, we always end up fightin'.
LEADMALE:Look who's here! Oh, Sophia, see if you can get them to stay for dinner.
SUPMALE:No, really, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I just came by to pick up a few things.
LEADMALE:There's just plenty of food.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you anyway.
LEADMALE:I'll get the baby's things.

LEADFEMALE:First you get one large pot, a dozen plump tomatoes and one moron to do all the work for you.
OTHERMALE:
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Well, I'm off.
LEADMALE:That would be my diagnosis.
LEADMALE:No, I mean I'm going out.
SUPMALE:Ma, put down the binoculars.
SUPMALE:No, I need them.
SUPMALE:I lost my glasses, and I'm not supposed to drive without them.
LEADMALE:Let's analyze this for a moment.
SUPMALE:You're now what, about 200 years old? About.
LEADFEMALE:You have no license.
SUPFEMALE:You're not allowed to drive.
LEADMALE:Curses! Dorothy, good, I'm glad you're here.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to help me go through these papers.
SUPFEMALE:They're to authenticate my family tree.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Tomorrow I have to present it out loud at the "Daughters of the Old South" initiation banquet.
SUPMALE:You're not really gonna go through with this, are you? Well, indeed I am.
LEADFEMALE:This club is a link to the proudest of all heritages.
LEADMALE:I remember, growin' up in Atlanta, how us girls used to pretend to be Confederate belles, and we'd receive gentleman callers.
OTHERMALE:Got to be like a competition.
OTHERFEMALE:In fact, I once received seven callers in one evening.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just thinking out loud, but isn't Atlanta where the Center for Disease Control is? Coincidence.
LEADMALE:Hey, these are all right.
LEADFEMALE:When I look through them backwards, you actually look demure.
OTHERMALE:Ma, get new glasses, all right?  Why must you always make such a big deal out of everything? Who's making a big deal out of it? I'm not making a big deal out of it.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi! Hi, Barbara.
SUPMALE:We got a call at the police station about lost glasses.
LEADMALE:You got my message.
SUPMALE:How many men you got on this? Well, none really.
LEADFEMALE:I did check, and nobody reported any lost glasses.
LEADFEMALE:Not lost.
OTHERFEMALE:Stolen.
LEADMALE:I want cops on this.
LEADFEMALE:Big, burly, steroid-crazed cops.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, fine, get one for Blanche, too.
LEADMALE:Throw it on my tab.
OTHERFEMALE:As long as I'm here, I should tell you there's been complaints from the neighbors about the noise at night.
LEADMALE:Which neighbors? Well, me.
SUPFEMALE:Which noise? Well, you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, get earmuffs.
SUPFEMALE:I pay my taxes.
SUPMALE:Ah, Rose, another date with Karl tonight, huh? You must really like this guy.
LEADMALE:I do.
LEADMALE:Karl is sweet, and he's supportive.
LEADMALE:He understands that I still have feelings for Miles.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, Miles is in the Witness Relocation Program.
LEADFEMALE:You're not supposed to be telling people about him.
LEADMALE:I didn't tell him Miles ratted on a gangster named The Cheeseman.
SUPMALE:He just knows there's somebody I can't see anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Karl is quite a guy.
LEADFEMALE:Lately I've been dreaming about him at night, not Miles.
LEADMALE:Although I do have one dream that both Karl and Miles are in.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh.
LEADMALE:And? OK.
LEADFEMALE:And Captain Kangaroo.
SUPMALE:Oh, and look here, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:This is my grandmother Marcelle Daboval.
LEADMALE:Pure Southern, through and through.
SUPMALE:Oh, Blanche, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I just don't like the idea of this club.
SUPFEMALE:It seems so discriminatory.
LEADFEMALE:There is nothing wrong with being proud of what you are.
LEADMALE:This club celebrates those individuals who can prove they come from 100% Southern Confederate stock.
LEADFEMALE:And if you can't, then fiddle-di-doo to you.
SUPMALE:Do you have any idea how much that hurts? Ladies and gentlemen, Roy Orbison.
LEADMALE:Ma, where did you get those glasses? They're an old pair of Pop's, but at least they've got prescription lenses.
SUPMALE:You can't possibly see through them.
LEADFEMALE:Take them off before you hurt yourself.
LEADMALE:No, they're great.
LEADFEMALE:I see just fine.
SUPFEMALE:Who's the black guy? I'm about done with this side of the family tree.
LEADFEMALE:I think you have the papers there from the Roquet marriage.
SUPMALE:Yeah, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, here.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Walker Roquet married Rosalyn Roquet, 1861.
SUPMALE:Rosalyn was fro- Uh-oh.
LEADMALE:What? I hate telling you this, Blanche No, that's not true.
LEADFEMALE:I look forward to telling you this, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:The woman your great-grandfather married was born, well, outside of Georgia.
LEADMALE:How far outside of Georgia? Buffalo.
LEADFEMALE:You're a Yankee, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, no, this can't be.
SUPFEMALE:A Yankee Doodle.
SUPFEMALE:There must be some mistake.
LEADMALE:You are that Yankee Doodle gal.
LEADFEMALE:Let me see the certificate.
SUPMALE:I want to see with my own eyes that my great-grandmother was that thing you said.
SUPFEMALE:A Yankee.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:A Yankee Doodle.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, stop it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, did I mention her last name was Feldman? Aw, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:No, it can't be.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't be Jewish.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be damned.
SUPFEMALE:The black guy is prejudiced.
SUPFEMALE:This information will have no bearing on my getting into the "Daughters of the Old South.
OTHERMALE:" I'll just lie.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, this is ridiculous.
OTHERFEMALE:Why should you have to lie? You're only one-eighth Yankee.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm seven-eighths' Southern.
OTHERFEMALE:That's more than enough.
SUPFEMALE:And if they don't let you in, instead of saying "fiddle-di-doo," well, you can always switch to Deedle didle deedle dum Thanks for a lovely evening, Karl.
SUPMALE:Rose, I've got an idea.
LEADMALE:What do you say we go away for the weekend? Karl, I'm not sure I'm ready to.
OTHERMALE:It's because of this Miles guy, right? I don't want to push you, but I just wish I knew what I was up against.
OTHERMALE:I mean, who is this guy? What did he do? Where is he now? I wish I could tell you, but I really don't know anything about him anymore.
LEADMALE:When I knew him, he was a professor at a college.
SUPMALE:That's hard to believe.
OTHERMALE:It's one of the few places they have professors.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:No, I know that.
LEADFEMALE:I meant I can't believe he left someone like you.
LEADFEMALE:He left someone else like me? No.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean you.
LEADMALE:That he left you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:OK.
LEADMALE:I should be more clear.
OTHERMALE:That'd be great.
SUPMALE:Listen, check with me later about the weekend.
OTHERMALE:I just want to be sure I'm ready, and that it's right.
LEADMALE:I'll give you a ring.
LEADFEMALE:I can't accept jewelry.
LEADMALE:I mean, I'll call you soon.
LEADMALE:I mean, I'll call you, Rose, soon and the phone will ring.
LEADMALE:Oh, he really understands me.
SUPMALE:Rose.
SUPMALE:Rose, it's me.
LEADMALE:Mi- Miles? I beg your pardon.
OTHERMALE:I'm sure Blanche will be out any minute.
SUPMALE:No, Rose, Rose, it's me.
LEADFEMALE:Miles? I've come back, Rose.
OTHERMALE:I had to see you.
LEADFEMALE:But you've changed.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm Amish, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:That's my new identity in the Witness Protection Program.
LEADMALE:See, I'm an Amish man.
LEADFEMALE:I live on an Amish farm.
LEADFEMALE:I carry wood, I dig holes and I milk things.
LEADMALE:And to be frank it sucks.
SUPMALE:I've missed you, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I've missed you, too, Miles.
LEADMALE:No, no, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:My name is now Samuel.
SUPFEMALE:Samuel Plankmaker.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't it dangerous for you to be here? You might have been followed.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, I took all kinds of precautions.
LEADFEMALE:I even switched buggies on the way over.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, of course, you can't tell a soul who I am.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't worry.
LEADMALE:Your secret is safe with me.
OTHERMALE:I don't know what I'm gonna do.
LEADMALE:Boy, you find out you're a Jew with a dilemma, and these rabbis just come out of the woodwork.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, who is this? This is This is a friend.
LEADMALE:His name is Samuel.
SUPFEMALE:Samuel Plankmaker.
SUPFEMALE:Samuel, these are my roommates.
LEADMALE:Girls, you know Miles.
LEADFEMALE:Samuel! Shoot! Sorry.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'm sorry, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:It's me.
SUPFEMALE:I was hoping to play a trick on you.
SUPFEMALE:Silly Rabbi, tricks are for kids.
LEADMALE:Look, ladies, I know it's a lot to ask, but I just had to see Rose.
SUPMALE:I can't risk leaving, at least not tonight.
SUPMALE:I need to stay here, if you'll let me.
OTHERMALE:Come on, Plankmaker.
SUPFEMALE:I'll fix up a room for you.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:I just want to go on record as saying I am against this.
OTHERFEMALE:That Cheeseman character could be following Miles, and there's no telling what he would do to me for information.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, you are really so self-centered.
OTHERFEMALE:In the first place, no gangster is going to come here.
LEADFEMALE:And secondly, Blanche, this is important to Rose.
LEADMALE:Aren't you interested in Rose's happiness? Happiness? I'm supposed to be happy? Just when I was getting on with my life, Miles shows up, and for a visit.
LEADFEMALE:He can't even stay.
OTHERFEMALE:How am I gonna move on? How is my heart ever supposed to heal with Miles here? Do you really think I'm self-centered? Huh? Come on, ya'll, hurry up.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, folks.
LEADFEMALE:I've gotta make a quick phone call.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, would you mind getting me some punch? He's gonna be late for the initiation ceremony.
LEADMALE:Oh, take it easy, Feldman.
LEADMALE:Hello, Billy Club? It's me/n Moran.
LEADFEMALE:No, Moran The Cheeseman.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, I need some fake ID to get out of the country.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I think my girlfriend's about to blab.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, thank you, Evelyn and Margaret, for that gripping and realistic reenactment of the defeat of General Burnside's troops at Fredericksburg.
OTHERFEMALE:It's hard to believe you couldn't get federal funding for this.
LEADMALE:Mom says "hi.
SUPMALE:" I'm sorry, what? Rose, what's going on with you? You've been acting strange lately.
LEADFEMALE:Seems like you're hiding something from me.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, I can't lie to you.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just not fair.
OTHERFEMALE:I have been hiding something from you.
OTHERMALE:I can't tell you where he's been, but Miles is back.
LEADMALE:He's staying with me.
OTHERMALE:I understand, Rose.
LEADMALE:And don't worry about your secret.
LEADMALE:It won't go any further than me.
LEADMALE:Now it's time to meet our new applicants and hear their lineage presentations.
LEADMALE:So let us begin with Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Louise Blakely.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, there is still time to back out.
LEADFEMALE:Do you really think you can go up there and betray your heritage? Dorothy, I belong in this club.
SUPMALE:Why, I'm just as Southern as the fruit of a scuppernong arbor growing proudly by the lazy Mississippi.
OTHERMALE:Lawdy, Lawdy, are you full of it.
LEADMALE:who married my Great Aunt Annalou Sellers, cousin to Claude Livaudais, who begat Elizabeth Blasingame.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Did you say Claude Livaudais? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:My great-grandfather told stories of Claude Livaudais.
SUPMALE:He once sold horseshoes to a Union soldier.
LEADMALE:Yankee.
LEADMALE:No, no, I can explain.
SUPFEMALE:Fie.
LEADFEMALE:Traitor.
LEADFEMALE:Oy vey.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that was a close one.
LEADFEMALE:We now call Blanche Devereaux.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, I can't see a thing.
LEADFEMALE:What's happening now? The Harlem Globetrotters just took the court.
LEADMALE:Hello, ladies.
LEADMALE:I want to thank you for making time for me.
OTHERFEMALE:But I wonder if, instead of reading my family tree, if I couldn't just say a few words about what the South means to me.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:We need your family tree.
LEADMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:OK.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I am Blanche Devereaux, nee Hollingsworth, of Atlanta, daughter of Curtis Hollingsworth and Samantha Roquet of Augusta and Shreveport, daughter of/n I can't do it.
LEADFEMALE:I Daughter of Feldman.
LEADMALE:I'm a Feldman, damn it.
SUPFEMALE:Of Buffalo.
SUPMALE:Oh, ladies, now, please, I beg of you.
OTHERFEMALE:Let us put aside our ancient prejudices and change these rules.
SUPMALE:Oh, ladies, let my people in.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Next up, we have a lady actually I would like to say something else, if you don't mind.
SUPMALE:Please let me in.
LEADFEMALE:No! Next up/n That wasn't what I was going to say.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I am a Yankee, but hath not a Yankee eyes? Hath not a Yankee hands? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? Sometimes all night.
LEADMALE:I've heard her.
LEADFEMALE:My point is, I am made up of many ingredients, but perhaps that is what gives me my uniquely American flavor.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, for I am an American, and I'm leavin'.
SUPMALE:I don't need your lousy club to make me feel special.
LEADMALE:Oh, please?  No! Oh, you lost the war.
LEADMALE:Get over it.
OTHERMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:Oh, honey, I hope you're not too upset about not fitting in with those dreadful people today.
OTHERMALE:Those small-minded peckerwoods aren't real Southerners.
LEADFEMALE:I am a real Southerner.
LEADMALE:Real Southerners are compassionate people.
LEADMALE:They're wise and gentle, and they sit around on porch swings, regaling with stories of Abraham and Moses and all the other people who worked on the plantation.
OTHERMALE:Well, I sent Karl home.
SUPMALE:Now I just have to talk to Miles.
LEADFEMALE:Talk to Miles? You seeing somebody else, Rose? Ah, I can explain.
LEADFEMALE:No, I understand.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Rose, of course, you're dating.
OTHERMALE:That's why I've come to a decision.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to Washington, talk to the Bureau.
LEADMALE:I am leaving the Witness Protection Program.
SUPFEMALE:I just know I need to be with you.
LEADMALE:But the Cheeseman is looking for you.
LEADMALE:Rose, don't worry.
OTHERFEMALE:So, hope I'm not interrupting anything.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God! You! How did you find me? Time to say goodbye, buddy boy.
SUPFEMALE:Karl, Miles, as flattering as this is, I I don't want you fighting over me.
LEADMALE:What? Karl? Is this the man you've been seeing? Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:But don't worry.
SUPMALE:He's just a little jealous.
SUPFEMALE:Got some bad news, Rose.
SUPMALE:It's not you he's after.
OTHERMALE:He's using you to get to me.
SUPMALE:This is the Cheeseman.
LEADMALE:Oh! My/n I'll have to figure out what to do with you.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You can't come into this house waving that gun around.
SUPMALE:Although it is a very nice one.
SUPMALE:What is this, a Colt? Oh, I knew all along it was a bad idea to let Miles stay here.
LEADMALE:I'm too young to be struck down by a madman's bullet.
LEADMALE:I've gotta find some way out of this.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get it.
OTHERMALE:No one moves and no one makes a sound.
LEADMALE:We all stand still until they leave.
LEADFEMALE:Don't make a move, old lady.
SUPMALE:Nice way to talk to your mother, Pussycat.
LEADMALE:Who is it? Put these on and find out.
SUPMALE:My glasses.
LEADFEMALE:Where did you find them? I'm afraid Dreyfuss was the culprit.
OTHERFEMALE:He got them off the lanai.
LEADFEMALE:You should really keep that gate closed.
SUPMALE:Anybody could get in here.
LEADFEMALE:It's great.
SUPMALE:I can finally see again.
LEADMALE:Hey, it's the Cheeseman.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, get in here, both of ya.
LEADMALE:Sophia, you recognize Karl as the Cheeseman? You don't? The man's been on America's Most Wanted at least six times.
OTHERFEMALE:The last episode was the highest rated ever.
LEADMALE:Ever.
OTHERMALE:That must be a good feeling.
SUPMALE:Well, it's kind of an acknowledgement.
LEADMALE:I hate to interrupt you, but I have some bad news.
LEADMALE:It's all over.
SUPFEMALE:That's right, you're busted.
SUPFEMALE:Barbara's a cop.
LEADFEMALE:In a dress, without a gun.
OTHERMALE:So, basically, what you have here is a crossing-guard thing.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all you gals are gonna get locked up in a closet, and us boys are going for a little walk.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Were you ever activities director of a place called Shady Pines? We got a lot of old business to discuss, mi amigo.
LEADFEMALE:An awful lot.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't there anything you can do, Barbara? I suppose I could do this.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Cheeseman, you're under arrest.
LEADMALE:You told us you didn't have a gun.
LEADFEMALE:You lied.
LEADMALE:To a bad guy.
LEADMALE:It's OK to lie to a bad guy.
SUPFEMALE:You see that? There's so many things we, as the public, don't understand.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna take this creep out front and read him his rights.
LEADFEMALE:Somebody call the station and tell 'em to get here, and I need handcuffs, right away.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, OK, you can borrow mine.
LEADFEMALE:But please be careful with them.
SUPMALE:They're a gift.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, why don't we make that phone call from the kitchen? Rose Rose, it's over.
LEADMALE:I'm a free man.
LEADFEMALE:I can be with you now, if that's still what you want.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that's all I've ever wanted.
LEADMALE:But you have to promise me never to leave me again.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, sweetheart, I might have to for a little while.
SUPMALE:Back on my farm in Pennsylvania, I still have an order in for 13 windmills.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, screw 'em.
LEADFEMALE:What are they gonna do, phone? 
SUPMALE:
SUPMALE:Blanche Devereaux's goin' on a diet.
SUPMALE:Could you hold off until tomorrow? I got some Sara Lee stock I'd like to unload.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Can I have those gummy bears? They are good, aren't they? Oh, I don't eat 'em.
OTHERFEMALE:Then why do you want 'em? To play army.
SUPMALE:And sometimes I like to line 'em up around my bed and pretend I'm Gulliver.
LEADMALE:Blanche, you put yourself through this hell every year.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure it's worth it? Of course it's worth it.
SUPFEMALE:On my anniversary, every year since I was married, I have slipped into my wedding dress and had my picture taken.
LEADMALE:George was always so proud of me for stayin' svelte.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna get into that dress this year even if it kills me.
SUPFEMALE:It's not you I'm worried about.
OTHERFEMALE:The last time you went on a diet, you turned into that guy from Silence of the Lambs.
OTHERFEMALE:You did everything but butter my face.
LEADFEMALE:It's gonna be different this time.
LEADFEMALE:See, I'm on this drink-it-off diet.
LEADMALE:"You have two shakes and a sensible meal every day, you lose weight the fast easy way.
SUPFEMALE:" I prefer the Italian diet.
SUPMALE:You drink a bottle of wine, make a smart remark, then get your jaw wired.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dorothy, a man called for you while you were out.
SUPFEMALE:Finally.
LEADMALE:Now we can break out that bottle of champagne we've been saving.
SUPMALE:Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:We might not get another chance.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure we will.
SUPFEMALE:We can just serve it at the wake.
LEADFEMALE:He says he's in Miami on business and he wants to see you.
LEADFEMALE:John Neretti called.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't heard from him in almost 40 years.
SUPMALE:Oh, I can't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:Who's John Neretti? He's a guy who humiliated me.
LEADFEMALE:Could you narrow it down a bit, Dorothy? He's the guy who stood me up for my senior prom.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, I had no idea you were stood up for your prom.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's awful.
LEADFEMALE:I figured you didn't go, but to be stood up.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, John Neretti was one of the toughest guys in my high school.
OTHERFEMALE:He smoked, he drank, he made those rude noises under his armpit.
OTHERMALE:I was totally in love with him.
LEADMALE:And when he asked me to go to the senior prom, I was thrilled.
LEADMALE:When I came down the stairs all dressed, Ma cried because her little girl was all grown up.
SUPFEMALE:And she remarked that that night would always be the most memorable and important night that the two of us ever shared.
LEADMALE:Remember, Ma? Vaguely.
LEADMALE:But John never showed up.
SUPFEMALE:I've never forgotten it.
SUPFEMALE:But apparently he has, or he wouldn't have had the nerve to call here.
LEADMALE:You're not gonna call him back, are ya? Oh, absolutely.
LEADMALE:If John comes to Miami, I want to see him.
LEADMALE:I don't think that's such a good idea, Pussycat.
SUPMALE:Ma, don't you see? When John Neretti gets here, I'm finally going to get my revenge.
LEADMALE:He's going to see a beautiful vibrant woman who's done something with her life.
LEADMALE:Well, Dorothy, I'd like to help, but/n I can't go out with him on such short notice.
LEADMALE:I meant "done something with her life standing up.
LEADFEMALE:" I'm talking about me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my revenge will be to make John feel as bad as he made me feel.
LEADFEMALE:I want him to see me, see my life, so he'll know exactly what he missed.
OTHERMALE:She doesn't know a whole lot about revenge, does she? Well, I'm ready for John.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I've waited a long time for this night.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, I'm begging you.
LEADFEMALE:Don't go out with this guy.
LEADFEMALE:He hurt you once, he'll hurt you again.
LEADMALE:I am not going out with him.
LEADMALE:But you said you were gonna make him suffer.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you have to date a man to do that? Not this time.
SUPMALE:No, I have my plan all worked out, step by step.
LEADFEMALE:First he'll comment on how stunning I look, and then I'll say, "Oh, John, did we have a date tonight? Oh, I completely forgot.
SUPFEMALE:" And as he crumbles, I will show him the door.
SUPMALE:What if he doesn't comment on how stunning you look? Then you'll bring it up.
SUPFEMALE:Time for my shake.
LEADMALE:Honey, how you doin' with this diet? Oh, no problem.
SUPFEMALE:Piece of cake.
LEADMALE:Nice big piece of chocolate cake.
LEADMALE:Devil's food, smothered in whipped cream and coconut flakes.
LEADFEMALE:And a lobster.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche.
LEADMALE:Ohh, I'm fine, I'm fine.
OTHERMALE:Ooh, a wonderful strawberry shake.
SUPFEMALE:Strawberry.
LEADMALE:Mmm.
LEADFEMALE:I bet that'd go great with a burger.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you're being a little insensitive, aren't you? A little.
LEADFEMALE:Who wants an Ã©clair?  Oh, God, that's John.
LEADMALE:Oh, I just hope I can be mean enough.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, do that thing you do to me in the morning when I try to take a piece of bacon off your plate.
SUPMALE:Blanche, I want to tell you something.
LEADMALE:I've never weighed more than 100 pounds on any day of my adult life.
SUPFEMALE:And because you're my friend, I want you to sit down, and I'll share with you that secret.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me, Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:I was born that way.
OTHERFEMALE:I could eat anything and never get fat.
LEADFEMALE:Did anyone ever tell you you look like George Kirby? No, no.
LEADMALE:Wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:It's time that John Neretti learned a lesson.
OTHERFEMALE:That I am not that same little girl whose head can be turned by a pair of beautiful eyes and a killer smile.
LEADFEMALE:Now.
LEADMALE:Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, look at you.
OTHERMALE:You're as beautiful now as you were then.
SUPMALE:How have you been? I love you! I, uh I'd love you to meet my friend Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:John Neretti.
LEADFEMALE:Shall we go? We've got reservations at 8:30.
SUPMALE:Take me.
LEADFEMALE:Out.
LEADMALE:Take me out for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy Ahem.
LEADMALE:I thought you were gonna make him suffer.
SUPMALE:Oh, and I will.
SUPFEMALE:Tomorrow morning I'll tell him he's the worst lover I ever had.
LEADMALE:Hope you like medieval food.
LEADMALE:I love it.
SUPFEMALE:Just glad I didn't have it for lunch.
LEADMALE:Good evening, my lord.
LEADFEMALE:Good evening, my lady.
SUPMALE:I am Don.
LEADFEMALE:I will be your fool for the entire evening.
SUPFEMALE:Would you like to know about our specials? We have pheasant and we have wild boar.
LEADMALE:How is the pheasant? You like chicken? Yes.
OTHERMALE:It's chicken.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you bring us a couple of grogs while we think about it? Diet grog if you have it.
LEADFEMALE:Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale A tale of a fateful trip That started from this tropic port Aboard this tiny ship Gee, it's so strange sitting here with you.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you're so different.
LEADMALE:Why? Well, I remember you as that tough kid in a leather jacket.
LEADMALE:Fights, vandalism.
LEADFEMALE:You were really a juvenile delinquent.
LEADMALE:But that's all behind you.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell me, what do you do now? I manufacture spray paint.
LEADMALE:At least all that training didn't go to waste.
OTHERFEMALE:If not for the courage of that fearless crew The Minnow would be lost The Minnow would be lost It's wonderful seeing you again.
SUPMALE:I'd forgotten how charming, how vivacious, how/n how lovely/n Two knights and a rabbi walked into a bar.
LEADMALE:And the first one said I would/n You were saying? Well, I was about to say I'm gonna be in town for a few more days.
SUPMALE:Can we get together Friday night? Oh, I can't on Friday.
LEADMALE:The high school where I teach is having its senior prom that night.
SUPFEMALE:I promised I'd chaperone.
SUPMALE:Can you bring a date? You can't be serious.
OTHERMALE:I'll buy you a corsage.
LEADFEMALE:Make it orchids.
SUPMALE:Just make sure you show up this time.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? You didn't show up at our last prom.
OTHERFEMALE:Not that I ever think of it.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? I showed up.
LEADMALE:What? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Your mother sent me away.
LEADMALE:She what? She said I was dressed like a bum and slammed the door in my face.
LEADMALE:She what? The millionaire and his wi-i-ife Something wrong? Oh, no, no, not at all.
LEADMALE:But I'll tell you, on the way out, I would like to stop at the gift shop.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna be needing one of those spiked balls on a chain.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Ma.
SUPMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, come back.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna sit and have a little talk.
OTHERMALE:Why? Come on, now, would it hurt to spend a little time with your daughter? That remains to be seen.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, would you excuse us just for a minute? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:I know that tone of voice.
SUPMALE:Somebody's gonna get it.
SUPMALE:Ma, I'm going to ask you a question, and however you answer, I'll believe you.
SUPFEMALE:Did you tell John Neretti to go away the night of my senior prom because you didn't like the way he was dressed? Well Liar! You knew John showed up that night, and you didn't tell me.
OTHERFEMALE:You didn't want me to go out with him tonight.
LEADFEMALE:You knew he'd bring it up.
SUPMALE:I can explain.
LEADFEMALE:Just don't lock me away in another ill-equipped nursing home.
SUPFEMALE:I promise nothing.
SUPFEMALE:It's true.
LEADMALE:I did send him away that night because he was dressed like a hood.
SUPMALE:He started to mouth off to me, so I told him to leave and not to come back until he was wearing a decent jacket and a tie.
OTHERFEMALE:Why didn't you tell me? I thought he'd come back, and when he didn't, well, I was afraid if you knew the truth, you'd never forgive me.
SUPMALE:It's water under the bridge.
LEADMALE:What's the big deal? Stanley Zbornak, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:That's the big deal.
LEADMALE:When John didn't show up that night, I lost all my self-esteem.
LEADMALE:And when Stan asked me out two weeks later, I said yes, because I didn't think I could do any better.
LEADMALE:That's why I went to that drive-in movie with Stan, and that's why I got pregnant.
SUPFEMALE:And that's why I got married.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you saying if it wasn't for me, you would have married John Neretti? I don't know.
SUPMALE:Maybe.
LEADFEMALE:Or maybe I would have met somebody else, somebody wonderful.
OTHERMALE:But I'll never know because of you.
SUPFEMALE:You took away my choices.
OTHERFEMALE:How can I ever forgive you for that? Time for today's sensible meal.
SUPMALE:Where's my tuna quiche? You heard me.
OTHERMALE:I said, where's my tuna quiche? I get 5 ounces of solid food a day, and I want my tuna quiche.
LEADMALE:You mean that little pie? Little pie? Little pie? I wanted a snack.
LEADMALE:A snack?! I thought it was a little fishy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you ate my sensible meal.
LEADFEMALE:You ate my sensible meal! Blanche, stop.
SUPMALE:Blanche! You're out of control.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose, honey, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:What did I just do? This.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, we know dieting is hard.
SUPMALE:We've all been there.
LEADFEMALE:I remember the time Stan and I went on that weight-loss- through-sex diet.
LEADFEMALE:The idea being every time you felt hungry, you would substitute food with some sexual activity.
SUPMALE:Did it work? I gained 18 pounds.
LEADFEMALE:Well, fine.
LEADMALE:I won't have my sensible meal.
SUPFEMALE:Tomorrow's my anniversary anyway.
SUPMALE:I'll just have my last shake tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Where's my shake? You heard me.
LEADMALE:I said, where's my shake? I needed something to wash down the little pie.
LEADFEMALE:Aah! It was so fishy.
SUPMALE:I don't believe you.
LEADMALE:Well, if it's any consolation, I'm still hungry.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, shut up! Just shut up, you babblin', bubble-headed, bleach-blond Baboon.
LEADFEMALE:baboon! She needed a "B.
OTHERMALE:"  John.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:I'll go get Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Won't you have a seat? Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Petrillo.
OTHERMALE:It's John Neretti.
SUPMALE:Well, you haven't aged a bit.
LEADMALE:I said, you haven't aged a bit.
LEADMALE:I hear you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not deaf.
OTHERMALE:"Haven't staged a hit"? Oh, John, I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy.
LEADMALE:You remember my lying vicious toad of a mother.
LEADFEMALE:Is there a problem? Oh, not at all.
OTHERMALE:Happy as ever at Happiness House.
LEADFEMALE:Aww.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess we should be going.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, not before I get a picture.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Dorothy, it's your prom picture.
LEADMALE:Say "cheese.
SUPMALE:"  Cheese.
OTHERMALE:Now smile.
SUPFEMALE:We'll save a lot of time if you just do it.
LEADFEMALE:Have a good time.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:I never got to go to the junior prom in St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf.
LEADMALE:How come? It was just for people named "Junior.
SUPFEMALE:" It fits.
LEADMALE:My wedding dress fits.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:You weren't married in a white dress? Oh, Rose, come on.
OTHERMALE:It's one thing to hear snickering when you walk down the aisle, but me in white? Even I couldn't keep a straight face.
LEADFEMALE:OK, Rose, come on, take the picture.
SUPMALE:I gotta hand it to you, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I never thought you'd fit into that thing.
LEADMALE:Well, all the pain and torture were worth it.
LEADFEMALE:George would be so proud of me.
LEADMALE:My body's just as lithe and taut as the day we were wed.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:It was an enchanting evening.
SUPMALE:"Enchanted Evening.
LEADMALE:" That was the theme of that prom that we never got to.
LEADMALE:Little more romantic than the theme they had tonight.
SUPFEMALE:"Wear A Condom" is more than a prom theme.
SUPFEMALE:It's sort of become the school slogan.
SUPMALE:It's catchy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I wish Stan had gone to that high school.
SUPMALE:You know, I I've got a little confession to make.
LEADMALE:One of the reasons I wanted to see you again was to, well, show you how well I turned out.
LEADMALE:Well, I wanted to show you how well I turned out.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I was a mess in high school.
SUPFEMALE:We all were.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Except for what was her name? Roseanne De Rasmo.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, she had it all together.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder whatever happened to her.
OTHERMALE:She turned into a bitter lonely lady.
LEADFEMALE:Came into a lot of money.
LEADFEMALE:At least, that's how she was after our divorce.
LEADFEMALE:I had a wonderful time tonight.
OTHERMALE:So did I.
OTHERMALE:I'm just sorry I messed up in high school.
OTHERMALE:It wasn't your fault.
SUPFEMALE:That was my mother's.
LEADMALE:Actually, I've always wanted to thank your mother for that night.
LEADFEMALE:Why? For not letting me take you out.
SUPMALE:She took one look at my clothes and my attitude.
SUPFEMALE:She said it wasn't good enough for her daughter.
LEADMALE:Her little girl deserved better.
LEADFEMALE:She actually said that? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:And a whole lot of Italian words.
OTHERMALE:I'm not too sure if it was a curse, but I did talk like a girl for about three weeks.
SUPFEMALE:It was a turning point in my life.
LEADFEMALE:That's when I finally started growing up.
LEADMALE:And all that happened because of my mother? I like to think so.
OTHERMALE:Tell you another thing I remember about that night.
SUPFEMALE:How nervous I was.
OTHERMALE:Nervous? About what? Our good-night kiss.
LEADMALE:I was terrified.
LEADFEMALE:I figured, "Oh, she's not gonna want me to kiss her good night.
SUPFEMALE:She'll/n" It was worth waiting for.
OTHERMALE:Can I call you next time I get back to town? I'd like that.
OTHERFEMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Don't take me, Death.
SUPFEMALE:Don't take me.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's you.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you OK? Yeah, I'm fine.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Ma, I said some terrible things to you, and I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I'm responsible for all the decisions I made in my life, and if my life didn't turn out perfectly, well whose has? Mary Ann Mobley comes to mind.
LEADFEMALE:She gets to sleep with Gary Collins every night.
LEADMALE:Every night.
LEADFEMALE:No, what I'm trying to say is we all make the best decisions we can make with what we know.
LEADFEMALE:Exactly.
LEADFEMALE:Just like it was on the night of your prom.
LEADFEMALE:I did what I thought was best.
SUPFEMALE:I was wrong.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, but you were my first.
LEADMALE:You didn't come with a book of instructions.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, all I ever wanted was the best for my little girl.
LEADMALE:Because you deserved it.
OTHERMALE:I didn't want you to settle for less.
LEADMALE:You still think of me as your little girl? Of course I do.
SUPMALE:In fact, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Sit on my lap for old times' sake.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:You can't be serious.
LEADMALE:I mean, I'm a grown woman.
LEADMALE:What's wrong with a mother wanting to hold her child? Dorothy, do this for me.
SUPFEMALE:Sit on my lap.
LEADMALE:Well, if you're sure.
LEADFEMALE:I Oh, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this brings back so many memories.
SUPFEMALE:The time I was five Bad idea! Bad idea! Ma, you all right? I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:I just panicked for a minute.
LEADMALE:Come, sit down here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:This is just like old times.
LEADMALE:So tell me, did you have a good time tonight at your prom, Pussycat? Wonderful, Ma.
SUPMALE:It was everything I wanted it to be.
LEADFEMALE:Come, tell Ma all about it.
SUPFEMALE:Well John bought me this beautiful corsage.
SUPFEMALE:And then, when we got to the gymnasium, it was so beautiful.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, when we got there, we walked in 
OTHERMALE:
SUPMALE:I'm not happy with my zabagliones.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you just need a push-up bra.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, zabaglione is a traditional Italian dessert.
SUPMALE:It's my Uncle Angelo's favorite.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, my brother.
LEADFEMALE:He's quite the scungiscoror-or-or.
SUPFEMALE:Even I don't know that one.
LEADFEMALE:That wasn't a word.
SUPFEMALE:My dentures slipped.
SUPMALE:Ma, Uncle Angelo's plane lands at 4:00.
SUPMALE:You have plenty of time to make a fresh batch before then.
LEADMALE:Good, because these aren't fit for human consumption.
LEADFEMALE:Top of the morning, sunshines.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Rose, try one of these.
LEADMALE:Oh, no thanks.
LEADMALE:I'm doing what we all should be doing/n dieting for the bachelorette auction next Saturday.
LEADFEMALE:Not all of us.
LEADFEMALE:I told you, Rose, count me out.
LEADMALE:Even if it is for charity, I am not gonna stand up there and allow myself to be sold to the highest bidder like some Holstein cow at a livestock auction.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, livestock don't get chauffeur-driven limousine rides to fancy four-star restaurants and the symphony afterwards.
SUPFEMALE:Except during St.
LEADMALE:Olaf Bicentennial Day.
SUPMALE:Rose, I am not going.
OTHERFEMALE:It is degrading.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be a stick-in-the-mud.
SUPFEMALE:It's for the Children's Hospital.
OTHERMALE:If you can't degrade yourself for a bunch of sick kids, who can you degrade yourself for? Listen to this.
LEADFEMALE:Eleanor Roosevelt in a garter belt.
SUPMALE:Now, you can't tell us that a part of you isn't at least a little excited.
SUPMALE:Remember last year's auction? That rush of euphoria when the auctioneer calls out "Sold!" and you fall into the arms of your valiant Galahad? My Galahad was a balloon salesman named Sid.
LEADMALE:Well, hey, who knew that sawed-off little gnome would outbid a Navy admiral? And a fire chief.
SUPMALE:And that jeweler who was a dead ringer for Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Richard Widmark.
SUPFEMALE:That was a year ago.
OTHERMALE:How do you remember all this? I tagged 'em for migratory purposes.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, come on.
LEADMALE:The auction needs you.
LEADMALE:The children need you.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, won't you reconsider? Oh, all right! It's only one night.
LEADMALE:I'll go, but I'll tell you, I really hate this.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on, Dorothy, that balloon man couldn't have been that terrible.
LEADFEMALE:I got the feeling I was the man's first date that wasn't inflatable.
LEADMALE:Hey, I have an idea.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy just did something really nice for us.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we do something nice for her? Why don't we buy her a man? Well, I'm in, and I know just the person.
LEADFEMALE:Free every Saturday night Oh, wait, that's a woman.
OTHERMALE:Oh, wait, that's Dorothy.
SUPMALE:No, I meant for the auction, so she won't get stuck with another loser.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, that's not a bad idea.
SUPFEMALE:We were all gonna donate money anyway.
LEADFEMALE:We could chip in, say, 50 bucks and buy her the bull of the ball.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, but who do we know who knows a man? Blanche, you know hundreds of men.
SUPMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:I just like to hear you say it.
LEADMALE:Hiya, sweetie pie.
OTHERMALE:How ya doin'? Fine, cupcake.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks for asking.
SUPMALE: Dorothy, I know you're in there.
SUPMALE:You always could slam a door.
LEADMALE:That's one of the things I love about you.
LEADFEMALE:You flatter me.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, wait.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, I have to talk to you.
LEADMALE:This wouldn't happen to be an apology for ruining our wedding, would it? No, just something I thought I should tell you in person.
LEADMALE:Remember my Uncle Morris? Dorothy, he died.
OTHERMALE:Boy, you smell good.
LEADFEMALE:Get away from me.
OTHERMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:You don't understand.
OTHERFEMALE:Something wonderful has happened.
LEADMALE:In his will, Uncle Morris left us an apartment building/n jointly.
SUPMALE:We're partners.
LEADMALE:Don't you see, Dorothy? We'll be together, and we'll have a place of our own.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, God, he's proposing to her again.
SUPMALE:Will one of you raise your standards, please?! Sophia, I'm not proposing.
SUPMALE:I'm here because Dorothy and I just inherited an apartment building.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna be landlords together.
SUPMALE:It's not a very big building, but she'll still clear a couple hundred bucks a month.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, this is wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:With that kind of money, we can hire a really good-lookin' gardener.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, it really does sound like a great opportunity.
LEADMALE:On Stan's behalf, Charlie once made a lot of money in business with a partner who was also a lousy, no-good, underhanded, backstabbing worm.
LEADMALE:Let me guess, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Ivan Boesky-Vanderfloovenhooven- meistergarbengerbenfleckman.
SUPMALE:That's the louse.
SUPMALE:So, um, what do you say, babe? Partners? Goodbye, Stan.
LEADMALE:OK.
LEADMALE:I get the message.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I'm just not a person you want in your life.
LEADMALE:Am I? Goodbye, Stan.
LEADFEMALE:Can you believe this guy? Like I would think for a minute about being in business with him.
SUPMALE:Nonsense, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:You can't pass up a chance to own real estate.
SUPFEMALE:It's been a lifesaver for me.
LEADFEMALE:You get a bunch of saps to pay your mortgage for you every month while your equity just rises higher and higher, while those poor suckers/n What I meant was it's a great opportunity to make new friends.
LEADMALE:Look who's here.
LEADMALE:Ah, buon giorno, Rosa.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my goodness.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't been hugged so much since V-E Day.
LEADMALE:Which was kinda tricky, because as you know, we lost.
SUPFEMALE:Angelo, you're even handsomer than you were your last visit.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:I been plucking, eh? See? I got two eyebrows now.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody loves 'em.
SUPFEMALE:You sit right down here, Angelo.
LEADMALE:I got a surprise for you/n zabaglione.
SUPMALE:Your favorite.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:And that's the new batch.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I cannot pretend no more.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Angelo, what's wrong? It's a long sad story, a story of love, a story of deception, a story of a fool.
LEADFEMALE:You know the story of Elsie Holdenfelder? Absolutely, Rose.
SUPMALE:That one's even more popular in Europe than it is here.
LEADFEMALE:I met a beautiful young Sicilian aerobics instructor.
LEADFEMALE:Gorgeous eyes, angelic mouth and a behind that must have been made on a Saturday because even the good Lord himself would want to take a day off to admire it.
SUPFEMALE:I lost my heart and I opened my wallet, eh? Oh dear, the expensive gifts and fancy dinners and weekends in Mykonos, eh? I even wore one of those, uh, tiny Speedo swimsuits, shows all your gingerbread and everything.
LEADMALE:And she leaves me.
LEADMALE:What does a 6'7" American basketball player got that I don't? Well, Angelo, speaking in terms of the gingerbread alone Blanche! Go ahead, Uncle Angelo.
LEADMALE:Anyway, I spend so much money on this girl, I forget about my business.
LEADMALE:The bank foreclosed, leaving me flat broke.
OTHERFEMALE:I got no savings, no place to live.
LEADMALE:And I gotta tell you, a lot of women find this a negative.
LEADMALE:It's a family curse, this obsession with women.
LEADMALE:The men in our family are weak.
LEADFEMALE:Why couldn't they all be more like Cousin Antony? Ma, Cousin Antony had an obsession with men in cowboy hats who hung around Times Square.
LEADFEMALE:What am I gonna do? You're gonna trust in your family, because family is there when you're down, and family stops at nothing!/n nothing to help one of their own.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I want my brother Angelo to come here and live with us.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:There's just no room.
SUPMALE:Hey, I tried.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:You're a landlord now.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe there's a vacancy in your new building.
LEADFEMALE:Don't call it my building.
LEADMALE:I don't even know if I'm gonna hang on to it yet.
LEADMALE:I I I understand.
SUPMALE:Sophia, any mail I get, just address it "Guy in the Gutter, Post Office Box Anywhere.
SUPMALE:" All right.
LEADMALE:All right, all right, Uncle Angelo.
SUPFEMALE:For the time being, I guess you can use Uncle Morris' old apartment.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, thank you so much.
LEADFEMALE:My first apartment in America.
LEADFEMALE:Here I will begin again.
LEADFEMALE:Here I will start a new life.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, my new life/n how close I'm gonna start it to the beach? Going once.
LEADFEMALE:Going twice You still want to tell me this isn't degrading? Don't be ridiculous.
SUPMALE:It's for charity.
LEADMALE:Sold! For $4.
LEADMALE:Well, it's degrading if you don't hit double figures.
OTHERFEMALE:I really appreciate your bidding on Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:It's for a good cause.
LEADFEMALE:You'll be rewarded.
SUPFEMALE:Not in this lifetime "Variety is the watchword for our next bachelorette" Dorothy Zbornak.
SUPFEMALE:Come on up, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:This is perfect.
SUPMALE:The way the bidding's going, we won't be out more than $20, $30 apiece.
LEADMALE:"If Dorothy's not off winging her way to Molokai "to assist Father Damian in his work with the lepers, you can find her hang-gliding high above the Florida Keys.
OTHERFEMALE:" Rose, where did you get that? From your mother.
OTHERFEMALE:Before she and I talked, I wasn't aware of any of it.
SUPMALE:"She's a scratch golfer who, under President Jimmy Carter, "served as the United States Senate Majority Whip.
SUPFEMALE:And she likes to read.
SUPFEMALE:" I figured, close with the truth.
LEADFEMALE:It'll kind of anchor the rest.
LEADFEMALE:I want to thank you all for holding this event on a night when my hang glider is in the shop and, uh, Congress is in recess and the lepers are on Geraldo.
LEADMALE:Go ahead, Rose.
LEADMALE:Right, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, let's start the bidding at $5.
OTHERMALE:$5.
LEADMALE:$100.
LEADFEMALE:Stanley, what are you doing here? I'm buying a date with the woman I love.
OTHERMALE:Oh, jeez.
LEADMALE:Not in front of people.
SUPMALE:What the hell is he doing? Didn't you give him a limit? this man removed.
LEADMALE:He's a lonely male impersonator.
LEADFEMALE:What?! What is wrong with you? The woman's been with lepers.
SUPMALE:Stanley, stop it.
OTHERFEMALE:I am not going out with you.
LEADMALE:I would rather be bound and gagged and left on an anthill covered with honey.
SUPFEMALE:Sold.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I say that.
LEADMALE:Sold! She says that.
LEADMALE:Rose, do something.
SUPFEMALE:Sold! Sorry, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:That's $500 for the Children's Hospital.
SUPMALE:I guess dreams really can come true.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, here's something that'll get your mind off Stan.
SUPFEMALE:According to my calculations, allowing for overhead, tonight brought in a grand total of $50.
OTHERMALE:No, $500.
LEADFEMALE:5,000.
LEADMALE:It's 5,000, Rose.
SUPMALE:Decimal points don't have six legs.
LEADFEMALE:More than 10% of it thanks to Dorothy here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, who's keeping score? What's important is that we made a lot of money.
OTHERFEMALE:Together we made a consid- They were fighting over me.
LEADMALE:Did you see it? Well, Dorothy, to be fair, one of 'em was Stan.
LEADMALE:Do I sense a tinge of envy there, Miss "going, going, gone" for 25.
LEADMALE:50? You can't put a price tag on beauty, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Oh, sure you can/n 25.
LEADMALE:50.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, Blanche.
LEADMALE:No, I'm not blaming any of this on you.
SUPFEMALE:It's all my fault for giving Stan so many chances.
LEADMALE:But I can't do this again.
SUPMALE:I mean, how many times can I make the same mistake? How many times can you bang your head against the wall before it starts to bleed? Nine.
SUPMALE:Believe me, Dorothy, I know what you're going through.
LEADFEMALE:I once had a relationship with a man I couldn't get rid of.
LEADMALE:Every time I turned around, there he was, pathetically underfoot.
LEADFEMALE:Long after I outgrew my need for him, he was there with flowers and candy, perfume.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't move without him following me like a puppy dog.
LEADFEMALE:How'd you finally get rid of him? Monday came, and we both had to go back to work.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:And thank you too, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:What did I say? Nothing.
LEADMALE:And I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, Dorothy, I want to talk to you about my apartment.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, I'm grateful.
LEADMALE:I love where I live.
OTHERFEMALE:And the last thing I want to do is come to you with every little problem.
LEADFEMALE:And now your mother would like to talk to you.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, you're making my brother live like a peasant.
SUPMALE:He has no closet space.
SUPMALE:Uncle Angelo, you moved in with one suitcase.
SUPMALE:What do you need with more closets? I don't like to talk about my brother's personal life, but a man brings a woman home, how is he supposed to play a decent game of hide and-go-seek? Under the table, behind the couch Bambi was on to me like that.
OTHERMALE:And then there's the water pressure.
SUPMALE:I got more water pressure than this apartment.
LEADMALE:And another thing/n W-Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Why is any of this your business? He's my brother.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm your daughter.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, I've known you, what, 60 years? Angelo I've known 85.
SUPMALE:To tell you the truth, I don't quite trust you yet.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Angelo, in the past three days you have complained about everything in the apartment except the rent.
LEADMALE:Reason being you don't pay any.
LEADMALE:I told you she'd throw it in our face.
SUPFEMALE:And speaking of complaints, what about that out-of control housewarming party that kept all the other tenants awake until dawn? The one I was not invited to? That wasn't a party.
LEADMALE:That was a quiet dinner for two.
LEADMALE:Hi there, Angelo.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Rose and I are ready for our date.
SUPFEMALE:I just think it's so sweet the way the mariachi band all chipped in to go on a double date with Rose and me.
LEADFEMALE:Here they are now.
LEADMALE:Angelo, great party the other night.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you look great in a tux.
LEADMALE:It wasn't your kind of crowd, Pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:That's funny.
SUPMALE:It's the same excuse you used when you didn't invite me to my Sweet 16.
LEADFEMALE:Now, that was a party.
LEADMALE:Hi, it's me Stan/n from the fund-raiser? I remember.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in.
LEADMALE:Uncle Angelo, Ma, I hope you don't mind.
LEADFEMALE:Stan and I are going to go into the kitchen and talk.
LEADMALE:Hey, great party the other night, Angelo.
SUPMALE:Stanley, I appreciate you coming here tonight, but I've decided I'm not going out with you.
SUPFEMALE:But I won the bidding at the auction.
LEADMALE:I understand that.
OTHERFEMALE:But there's nothing you can say to make me change my mind.
LEADFEMALE:You owe me $500.
LEADFEMALE:How about Thai food? That sounds great.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, wait, wait.
LEADMALE:I said I'm not going to go, and I am not going to go.
LEADMALE:It's just that, well, you have different intentions than I do.
LEADMALE:It's not my intentions, it's God's intentions.
LEADMALE:D-Do you think this is all a coincidence? I mean, look/n your uncle visits, my uncle dies.
LEADMALE:Your uncle needs a place to live, my uncle gives us a building.
SUPMALE:Don't you see? God wants us to be together, babe.
OTHERMALE:It's almost Biblical.
LEADFEMALE:And thus he smote your Uncle Morris, huh? There's a whole school of thought that says he's a wrathful God.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well that would explain your hair.
OTHERFEMALE:Stanley, pay attention.
LEADMALE:No date tonight.
LEADFEMALE:OK, I guess I'll just have to go through my life without you in it.
SUPFEMALE:Stanley, I am in it.
OTHERFEMALE:We're business partners.
LEADFEMALE:That's the extent of it.
LEADFEMALE:You understand? OK.
LEADMALE:OK, I give up.
OTHERFEMALE:Business partners.
LEADMALE:I understand.
OTHERFEMALE:Can we shake on it? I need you, Dorothy! I want you! Without you, I'm nothing.
LEADMALE:Do you hear me? Nothing.
OTHERMALE:Stan, as much of a turn on as this is, get off the floor.
LEADFEMALE:I belong on the floor if I've driven you out of my life.
LEADFEMALE:From this moment on, the floor is my home.
LEADFEMALE:Enjoy.
LEADMALE:Dorothy! I can explain, Ma No need to, Pussycat.
OTHERMALE:Let's move quick before the cops get here.
LEADFEMALE:You wipe for fingerprints, I'll get a shovel and a Hefty bag.
SUPMALE:Sophia.
OTHERMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:It figures you couldn't finish the job.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna go get the toaster.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! Ow! Sophia, I'm not dead.
OTHERFEMALE:Not yet.
LEADMALE:Would you slow down? I'm an old woman! Stan, I want no part of any of this.
OTHERMALE:I am out.
SUPFEMALE:I am selling my half of the building.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:I'm glad.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tear the dump down and turn it into office space for Zbornak, Incorporated.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Fine! Don't blame me that it means throwing your uncle out on the street.
SUPFEMALE:Stan, that's blackmail.
SUPFEMALE:But it's got a certain logic.
LEADMALE:So, business partners? I have no choice.
LEADMALE:Business partners.
LEADMALE:And dinner? Absolutely not.
LEADMALE:Stanley, you claim that you have changed.
SUPMALE:Well, so have I.
LEADFEMALE:Stan, I have finally come to realize that no matter how hard you try, you cannot fix something that no longer works.
LEADFEMALE:I've learned to let go, Stanley.
LEADMALE:Dorothy And you should, too.
LEADMALE:I don't know if I can do it.
SUPMALE:If that guy at the auction had bid $6 million for you, I don't care what I would have had to do, I would have come up with six million and one.
LEADMALE:You're my girl, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:You always will be.
LEADFEMALE:But if you want me to go, then that's what I'll do.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Pussycat/n I can't believe it.
SUPMALE:He's not coming back.
LEADMALE:You OK? Yeah, I think I'm OK.
LEADMALE:No, no, I know I'm OK.
LEADMALE:You know, Ma, for the first time, I feel that it's over, that it's really over.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, forgive me, but I gotta speak.
LEADMALE:Sometimes it's harder to close the door than to open a window.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's very wise, Uncle Angelo.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, I was talking about the apartment, but I'll take wise.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hi, girls.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Rose, I missed you at breakfast.
SUPFEMALE:Did you and Miles have fun last night? Oh, yes.
OTHERFEMALE:We had dinner at the Mandarin Rathskeller, that new Chinese-German restaurant.
OTHERFEMALE:How was it? Oh, the food was good.
LEADMALE:But an hour later, Miles and I were both hungry.
OTHERFEMALE:For power.
SUPFEMALE: Oh, my, that provincial Midwestern sense of humor that everybody hates.
LEADMALE:Yes? Hello.
LEADMALE:I'm Detective Parres, Dade County P.
LEADMALE:D.
LEADFEMALE:Does a Sophia Petrillo reside here? This is my mother.
LEADMALE:Is there a problem? I'd just like to ask a few questions.
LEADFEMALE:I've got nothing to hide, copper.
LEADFEMALE:Or do you prefer "flatfoot" or "gumshoe"? Before my mother lost it completely, she watched a lot of James Cagney.
LEADFEMALE:They colorized him.
OTHERMALE:Can you believe it? Let the man rest.
OTHERFEMALE:He's got hair the color of Rose's and more rouge than Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever you think she did, she's guilty.
LEADMALE:I saw her.
OTHERMALE:Please sit down.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Petrillo, where were you on the night of September 4th, 1985? Did you see Awakenings? Throw a ball at me.
LEADFEMALE:How the hell should I know? I don't even remember what color underwear I'm wearing.
LEADMALE:Ma, the beginning of September.
LEADMALE:That's when Shady Pines burned down and you came here to live with us.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not wearing underpants.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Petrillo, were you acquainted with the late Maria Heartgrove? She died? Good riddance.
SUPFEMALE:God rest her soul.
OTHERFEMALE:We have a deathbed confession from her stating that the two of you started the Shady Pines fire.
OTHERFEMALE:Why, that's ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:What did you do? She claimed that on the night of the fire, the two of you were in your room cooking s'mores.
LEADFEMALE:Nonsense.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even know what s'mores are.
LEADMALE:You remember, Sophia.
SUPMALE:They're those little toasted graham cracker and chocolate sandwiches.
LEADFEMALE:Marshmallow.
LEADMALE:Don't forget the marshmallow.
LEADFEMALE:Whoops.
LEADMALE:In her deposition, Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Heartgrove said that you were in possession of an illegal hot plate, and while you were cooking, the curtains caught on fire.
LEADFEMALE:Then you panicked and fled, and the fire continued unchecked.
LEADMALE:Now wait just a minute.
LEADFEMALE:This is crazy.
LEADMALE:Do you have any proof? Did anybody find that alleged hot plate? Presumably it was lost in the fire.
LEADMALE:Maria was just out to get me.
SUPFEMALE:She was always jealous because I still had my own hair.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Petrillo.
LEADFEMALE:I have no choice but to bring you in on a charge of negligent arson.
OTHERMALE:My mother is 85 years old.
SUPMALE:Surely you/n I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:The law recognizes no age limits.
SUPMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Petrillo, you're under arrest.
LEADFEMALE:Well, all's well that ends well.
LEADFEMALE:What? It's a title of a Shakespeare play.
LEADMALE:Rose, nothing is well, and nothing has ended.
LEADMALE:Sophia's out on bail, awaiting her trial.
LEADMALE:Well, if Dorothy had said it, you'd think it was brilliant.
LEADFEMALE:So this is life on the outside.
LEADFEMALE:It's changed.
LEADMALE:You've all gotten so old.
LEADMALE:Ma, knock it off.
LEADFEMALE:You were gone an hour.
LEADFEMALE:If anyone's upset, it should be me.
LEADFEMALE:I had to dig up the bail money.
SUPMALE:Please.
SUPMALE:How do you put a price tag on getting your mother back? What was it, $500? Wow.
OTHERFEMALE:I better improve my attitude around here.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Herb, here you are.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Girls, this is Herb Shrewsbury, our lawyer.
SUPMALE:So, what are my chances, shyster? Or do you prefer "ambulance chaser"? Ma, he's here to help you.
LEADFEMALE:Are you nuts? If it helps.
SUPFEMALE:Well, the trial is set for a month from now, so I'm going to need some character witnesses.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you should start by interviewing me.
LEADFEMALE:I would make a wonderful witness.
SUPFEMALE:I can't tell you how many times I've been badgered by lawyers.
OTHERMALE:Well, I could, but it might sound like boasting.
LEADMALE:Oh, the stories I could tell you about me.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not gonna believe this, but I I shall become a great Southern writer, carrying on the tradition of the other great Southern writers like uh all those that are so famous they need not be mentioned.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, girls, it's gonna be so exciting.
SUPMALE:I am gonna make a fortune.
SUPMALE:And I won't even have to use my imagination.
LEADMALE:My life is a romance novel.
LEADFEMALE:Your life is a sports page.
SUPFEMALE:Listen.
SUPMALE:Tell me I can't do better than this in my sleep.
LEADMALE:"He grabbed her.
SUPFEMALE:"She could feel his fingers pressing into her moist flesh.
SUPMALE:"Her heart was pounding, her loins on fire as he spun her around, her dress ripping open" You know how many times I've experienced that? Your loins have been on fire? Yes.
SUPMALE:"She melted into his/n" Where exactly are your loins? Rose, it doesn't matter.
LEADMALE:Just listen.
SUPFEMALE:"She melted into his arms, faint now with the animal musk of him" I didn't know people had loins.
OTHERMALE:I've heard of loin of pork, but In her case, the same thing.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't this exciting/n taking part in a protest? Standing up as free Americans and exercising our right to say, "We're mad as hell and we're not gonna take it anymore.
OTHERMALE:" I'm out of spit.
LEADMALE:Can I go now? and you're ready to quit? We joined the Friends of Sea Mammals for a reason.
SUPFEMALE:You are so unmotivated.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, when I joined this Mammals With Blowholes thing I didn't expect to be carrying picket signs on some grungy dock.
LEADMALE:I was hoping more for a fund-raiser cocktail party with Chinese lanterns and Portuguese/n no, Hispanic waiters in tight black pants.
LEADMALE:And we hire a band to play fish songs in pirate suits with muscles bulging.
OTHERFEMALE:Your mouth is watering now, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Keep licking.
LEADFEMALE:Herb, I'm aware of how important it is to make a good impression in court.
SUPFEMALE:Tell me, what do you think would move the jury more/n cleavage or a lot of leg? That depends on what you're going for/n a chuckle or a guffaw.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I think a conservative ensemble is in Sophia's best interest.
OTHERMALE:Oh, there'll be music? Ma, where you going? If he puts you three on the stand, up the river.
LEADMALE:Ma, what are you doing up? I can't sleep.
OTHERMALE:I keep trying to think back on that night at Shady Pines.
LEADMALE:And? And we're out of toilet paper.
SUPFEMALE:I told you, Dorothy, I can't remember a thing.
LEADFEMALE:Just because your memory is fuzzy doesn't mean that you're guilty.
LEADMALE:Doesn't mean I'm innocent, either.
LEADMALE:Ma! Let's face it.
OTHERFEMALE:I've done some pretty peculiar things in my day.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course, I've got an excuse.
SUPMALE:I'm an old lady.
LEADMALE:I left my mind in the '60s.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, have you seen my teeth? They're in your mouth, Ma.
LEADMALE:I know that.
LEADFEMALE:Don't they look good today? I ran them through the dishwasher.
LEADMALE:Ma, listen to me.
LEADMALE:You got Martha Raye and Madge mixed up again.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Morning, Ma.
LEADMALE:You sleep well? No.
SUPFEMALE:I had that recurring nightmare, the one where I'm in bed with Warren Beatty and he says, "Sorry, this is too sick, even for me.
SUPFEMALE:" Well, now I know why Hemingway killed himself.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, girls, I have writer's block.
OTHERFEMALE:It is the worst feeling in the world.
LEADMALE:Try ten days without a bowel movement sometime.
LEADMALE:You just sit there, hour after hour after hour.
LEADMALE:Tell me about it.
LEADMALE:Frisk me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Ma, stop that.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing? Just frisk me.
OTHERMALE:Frisk me.
SUPMALE:It's important practice for me if I'm going to prison.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, you are not going to prison.
LEADMALE:Now think back.
LEADFEMALE:Shady Pines.
SUPMALE:What was the last thing that you remember before that fire? Meat loaf.
LEADFEMALE:Nine days in a row.
OTHERMALE:Their only witness is dead.
LEADMALE:That ought to work in our favor.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, that hot plate was mine.
LEADMALE:I made s'mores all the time.
SUPMALE:I hated Shady Pines.
SUPMALE:I can't remember, but I know I did it.
LEADMALE:I must have.
SUPMALE:I'm goin' to prison.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma won't come out of her room.
SUPMALE:She's miserable.
SUPMALE:Just to keep me up to speed, Dorothy/n it's this negligent arson rap and the prospect of spending the rest of her waning years in jail thing, right? No, it's the "Rose in the kitchen" thing.
LEADMALE:I just hate to see Sophia so unhappy.
SUPFEMALE:I wish there was something we could do to make her feel better.
SUPMALE:I mean, we're always there when we need each other.
LEADFEMALE:You know, if I have a problem, Rose is there for me, and if Dorothy has a problem, I'm there for her.
LEADFEMALE:I wish I knew what to do.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I can pick up a cue.
LEADFEMALE:Picture it.
LEADFEMALE:Sicily, 1912.
LEADFEMALE:A beautiful young peasant girl with clear olive skin meets an exciting but penniless Spanish artist.
LEADMALE:There's an instant attraction.
LEADMALE:They laugh, they sing, they slam down a few boilermakers.
LEADMALE:Shortly afterwards, he's arrested for showing her how he can hold his palette without using his hands.
SUPMALE:But I digress.
SUPMALE:He paints her portrait, and they make passionate love.
LEADMALE:She spends much of the next day in the shower with a loofah sponge scrubbing his fingerprints off her body.
LEADMALE:She sees the portrait and is insulted/n it looks nothing like her/n and she storms out of his life forever.
LEADMALE:That peasant girl was me and that painter was Pablo Picasso.
LEADMALE:Ma, I have a feeling you're lying.
LEADFEMALE:Be positive, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:OK, I'm positive you're lying.
LEADFEMALE:This is terrible.
OTHERMALE:Trick move from your checkers-by-mail partner? No, it's from the company Charlie worked for.
LEADFEMALE:They've gone bankrupt and so has their pension fund.
SUPMALE:I'm not gonna be getting pension checks anymore.
LEADMALE:I can't afford to live without that pension.
LEADFEMALE:Let's not panic.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure they can't just cut you off.
LEADMALE:She's right.
LEADFEMALE:There has to be a good explanation.
LEADMALE:You'll call them tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Everything will be fine.
LEADMALE:What if it's not? What if I can't pay my own way? What if I can't afford food? What if I have to sleep outside in some park? There's an old Italian saying for times like this.
LEADFEMALE:Scappa.
LEADMALE:Tu si mal fortuna.
SUPFEMALE:What does that mean? Get away from me.
LEADFEMALE:You're bad luck.
LEADMALE:OK, that's it.
OTHERFEMALE:Drink this.
SUPFEMALE:It's a secret potion from the old country guaranteed to put you to sleep.
LEADMALE:Looks like milk.
LEADFEMALE:Trust me, Rose.
LEADMALE:Drink it.
SUPMALE:Slowly.
LEADMALE:That's right, down the hatch.
LEADMALE:We call this Sicilian Sominex.
SUPMALE:Now, you might feel a slight tingling, but believe me, you'll sleep like a baby.
OTHERMALE:I don't feel any tingling.
LEADMALE:When's it gonna hit me? Sophia! Oh, I just had a terrible thought.
LEADMALE:What if, in some weird way, all this was true and Ma went to jail? Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:This is very important, Rose.
LEADMALE:It might take a couple of hours, so relax and get comfortable.
LEADMALE:The last time someone said that to me, I had two pigs on my back and I was pushing a wheelbarrow.
LEADMALE:Why? To relax and get comfortable.
LEADMALE:OK, now, where should I begin? Let's see.
LEADMALE:I think the one thing you need to know is that I'm the one around here with the level head, the real voice of reason.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't been this scared since 1952 when St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf's most active volcano threatened to erupt.
LEADMALE:Luckily there were some Druid priests who were in town for the opening of Stonehengeland.
SUPMALE:They said they could stop it if they could sacrifice the town's dumbest virgin.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know why I raised my hand.
LEADMALE:It must have just been the excitement of the moment.
LEADFEMALE:But they said the only way to prevent the eruption was for me to crawl through their legs up the volcano while they gave me my birthday whacks.
OTHERFEMALE:Well/n and you're not gonna believe this/n it turns out they weren't Druid priests at all, just a bunch of Shriners looking for a good time.
LEADMALE:All creatures must learn to coexist.
OTHERMALE:Back where I come from, they do.
LEADMALE:That's why the brown bear and the field mouse can share their lives and live in harmony.
SUPMALE:'Course, they can't mate or the mice would explode.
SUPMALE:You want me to drive tonight, Dorothy? Oh, Rose, listen.
OTHERMALE:I'm not going to the meeting tonight.
SUPMALE:Oh? How come? I'm not comfortable there.
SUPMALE:I'm not comfortable with the people, with the whole thing.
LEADFEMALE:But you need the group support, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:It's not a good idea to go it alone.
SUPFEMALE:Did I ever tell you about my cousin Vigdov Frickin? He tried to go it alone in a three-legged race.
LEADMALE:Well, you know what happened to him? Please.
SUPMALE:Please, Rose! I don't want to hear about your Frickin cousin.
LEADMALE:That was very interesting, Rose, but now that I've heard you, I think I'll probably just plead insanity.
OTHERFEMALE:You look perfectly sane to me.
SUPMALE:High praise indeed.
LEADFEMALE:Pussycat, when I go to trial, will you be a character witness for me, tell them I'm sweet and cute and don't have it in me to harm a fly? What, you want me to perjure myself? Basically.
SUPMALE:Ma, don't worry.
SUPMALE:Everything's gonna be fine.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you for trying to cheer me up, Pussycat.
LEADMALE:You're always there for me.
OTHERFEMALE:I appreciate that.
OTHERFEMALE:We're there for each other.
LEADMALE:I don't know of any other mothers and daughters who have gone through half of what we've gone through.
LEADFEMALE:I can't tell you how much it meant to me when you and I Two-and-a-half hours.
LEADMALE:I thought you died.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with you? Nothing.
LEADMALE:Who are you? I'm the doctor.
LEADMALE:We'll see about that.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Mrs Petrillo.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Dorothy's mother.
LEADMALE:I wanna know what's wrong with her.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell me "nothing," because I know there's something wrong with her.
SUPFEMALE:Mothers know.
OTHERMALE:Look, Ma, I'll talk to you about it later.
LEADMALE:Your daughter is fine, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Petrillo.
LEADMALE:Tip-top? Tip-top.
LEADFEMALE:Then, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:100% Tip-top, why the hell does she feel like hell? Look, Ma Wait.
SUPMALE:I gotta hear this.
LEADMALE:It could be functional.
LEADMALE:Functional? Mental.
LEADFEMALE:Mental.
SUPMALE:Well, let me tell you something, Mr.
LEADMALE:100% Tip-top Mental, my daughter may be no spring chicken and her jaw might crack when she chews and she may have noticeable trouble digesting raw vegetables, but one thing she's not is mental.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, Ma.
LEADMALE:OK, girls, I'm ready.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Rose, do I look like the mayor of Palm Springs? Doug Henning is the mayor of Palm Springs? Just play the music, Rose.
LEADMALE:They say we're young and we don't know We won't find out until we grow I don't know if all that's true But you got me and, baby, I got you Babe I got you, babe I got you, babe You know, Ma, I guess we do have a good relationship.
LEADMALE:It's always been good.
OTHERFEMALE:I know we never did some of those mother/daughter things/n baking cookies, dressing alike, braiding each other's hair.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but wasn't it great making fun of those who did? It sure was.
OTHERFEMALE:But come on, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:The truth is, we have done our share of fighting.
LEADMALE:Of course we fight.
LEADMALE:We're Italian.
SUPMALE:We like to fight.
OTHERFEMALE:It's our way of showing love.
OTHERMALE:Though I don't know if there was a lot of love that time that we Hi, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Gimme your watch.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want it for? I'm working on a magic act for the talent show at the center.
LEADFEMALE:Abracadabra, 1, 2, 3.
LEADMALE:Ma! Relax.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, was your card the ace of spades? Ma, what the hell are you talking about? I think I got chapters seven and nine mixed up.
SUPMALE:Ohh.
LEADMALE:This watch is broken.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, Stan gave me that watch when we got married.
LEADMALE:The marriage never worked.
OTHERFEMALE:Why should the watch? I waited up for you until two in the morning, and you still weren't home.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Gertie and I and some of the girls went to Wolfie's to pick up guys.
LEADFEMALE:I called Wolfie's at 11.
SUPMALE:You weren't there.
LEADMALE:Guess who got lucky.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, God! What can I tell you? A couple of egg creams, the bright fluorescent lights and a retired jeweler named Shlomo all conspired to make a night of enchantment.
OTHERFEMALE:Not for me.
LEADFEMALE:I can't tell you some of the horrible thoughts I had about what might have happened to you.
SUPMALE:Although none as horrible as what you just described.
LEADMALE:Ah, there you are.
OTHERMALE:Ma, I scheduled the appointment for your checkup.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you know you have to have a physical.
LEADMALE:What do you want me to do/n take you to court, have you declared incompetent? I'm not incompetent.
SUPMALE:Once when I laughed too hard, I had a little accident.
LEADFEMALE:I guess we do have a strange way of showing our affection.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma, I'm glad to see you've cheered up, but why are you walking down memory lane all of a sudden? It's just that I may not see you for a while.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, they can't prove that you started that fire at Shady Pines, and you are not going to jail.
SUPFEMALE:You can't be sure of that, Pussycat, so I'm doing what I have to do.
LEADFEMALE:I'm jumping bail and moving back to Sicily.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, hi, Ma.
LEADMALE:How was your nap? Nap? I didn't take a nap.
OTHERMALE:I'm a nervous wreck.
LEADMALE:How could I sleep a wink with this prison thing hanging over my head? Let's grab lunch.
OTHERMALE:Ma, it's dinnertime.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I guess I did take a nap.
SUPMALE:Ma, I don't know why you're nervous.
OTHERMALE:You are not going to prison.
SUPMALE:I feel like I am in prison, with you keeping an eye on me 24 hours a day.
LEADFEMALE:Are you gonna keep doing that for the rest of my life? No, only until you give up this ridiculous idea about leaving the country.
SUPMALE:I'm not skipping bail.
LEADFEMALE:I'd never make it.
LEADFEMALE:Every cab driver, waitress and skycap between here and Sicily would be only too eager to talk to the police.
LEADMALE:Why do you say that? I under-tip.
OTHERMALE:Look, Ma, I know you're nervous, but Herb is a brilliant lawyer, and, honey, you have the love and support of all of us.
LEADMALE:Is there anything I can get you from the kitchen? Just bread and water.
LEADMALE:Maybe I'll acquire a taste.
SUPFEMALE:How's Sophia? She's over that crazy idea about Sicily, but she's still very concerned about going to jail.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, who wouldn't be? It's a terrifying prospect to think about.
SUPFEMALE:Prison.
LEADFEMALE:The coldness of it, the steel bars, the wedges of cheese hanging overhead, tantalizingly just out of reach.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me guess/n St.
SUPMALE:Olaf County Jail? And deli.
LEADMALE:Look, we have to do everything we can to help Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Now, the three of us have got to put our heads together and try to figure out for certain how that fire got started.
OTHERFEMALE:You're so right, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:And we can start by ruling out the obvious.
LEADMALE:Does Sophia have any friends who are or ever have been circus fire-eaters? No.
LEADFEMALE:Would she like to meet some? Don't you worry.
SUPFEMALE:Now we'll get to the bottom of this.
SUPMALE:Lord knows we've worked our way out of tight spots before.
OTHERMALE:Who was it who got us into that Oh, just a minute, now I remember.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, it's worth a try.
OTHERFEMALE:It's either we sing or he sings.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, all right.
LEADMALE:Boom Boom Well? Well, what? After my boom comes your boom and then yours, until we're all booming.
LEADMALE:How complicated is that herring thing? Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom boom boom boom Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom boom boom boom Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Sandman, bring me a dream Boom, boom, boom, boom Make him the cutest that I've ever seen Boom, boom, boom, boom Give him two lips like roses and clover Boom, boom, boom, boom Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over  Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom Mr.
SUPMALE:Sandman Yes? Bring me a dream Make him the cutest that I've ever seen Give him the word that I'm not a rover And tell him that his lonesome nights are over Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Sandman I'm so alone Boy, you guys really stink.
SUPMALE:Look, I'm not going out with him.
LEADMALE:You go, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:What?! You like him.
SUPMALE:I know you do.
LEADFEMALE:So you go.
LEADMALE:Well, I couldn't.
LEADMALE:Of course she couldn't.
OTHERMALE:You stay out of this, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why not? It's all over between us.
SUPMALE:He'll know that tonight.
LEADMALE:Well, it's impossible.
LEADFEMALE:I'd feel like a I'd feel like a A back-stabbing slut? No.
SUPMALE:Then please go, for me.
SUPMALE:I'd feel better knowing this thing is finally over with.
LEADMALE:Well, since you put it that way But only as a personal favor to you, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess I'd better go get dressed.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Can you believe that back-stabbing slut? Well, now that we know we can work our way out of jams, exactly how are we gonna work our way out of this one? There's one thing we could do.
SUPMALE:We could get something to eat.
LEADMALE:Can we concentrate? It seems like all we ever do around here is eat.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it's all you ever do.
SUPMALE:Oh, excuse me.
OTHERFEMALE:I forgot about all those other appetites you satisfy before going to the fridge.
SUPMALE:My life is more than just sex and food.
LEADMALE:I take care of this house.
LEADFEMALE:Why, just the other day we had a leak, and the gas man came out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:I guess that falls under sex.
LEADFEMALE:And you did fix him a sandwich afterwards.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess sex and food are a big part of our lives.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, just recently/n last summer, or last spring? It's so hard to remember which Why does it have to be so hard? The hardest part for me was explaining to my Kirsten the difference between boys and girls.
LEADFEMALE:I knew the time had come, but I kept putting it off.
SUPFEMALE:Finally, I decided it was time to take the bull by the horns.
LEADFEMALE:So you told her? No.
LEADMALE:I took the bull by the horns, turned him around and showed her what makes a bull a bull.
LEADMALE:You are kidding, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:That's how my mother taught me.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, didn't that give you a false impression about what a man would look like? It sure did.
SUPFEMALE:Can you imagine my surprise on my wedding night with Charlie? Boy, that bull would have been jealous.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, quite frankly, I don't get it.
LEADMALE:What is this hold that Buzz has over you? I know exactly what she's going through.
LEADMALE:First love can be very powerful.
LEADMALE:I felt the same way about Heyward Boyle, the star pitcher on our high school baseball team.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, an amazing athlete.
OTHERMALE:That boy had exceptional control.
LEADMALE:He was always up for extra innings.
SUPFEMALE:And his delivery.
LEADMALE:Oh/n All right, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Enough! Yeah.
SUPMALE:We get it.
SUPFEMALE:So, what was he like in bed? I have to agree with Blanche on this one.
LEADMALE:Half the fun is in getting there.
LEADMALE:Boy, did your father and I have fun trying for you.
LEADMALE:Ma, I don't think I want to hear this.
SUPFEMALE:I wasn't gonna tell you until you're 60, but I think you can handle it now.
LEADMALE:We lived in New York.
LEADFEMALE:There was the San Gennaro Festival every year.
LEADFEMALE:Your father/n may he rest in peace until I get there/n got so turned on by the festivities one year he couldn't wait till we got home.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Ma.
SUPMALE:So he took me/n right there behind the sausage and pepper stand.
SUPMALE:Hey, we were behind the garbage cans.
LEADMALE:It's not like we were in front of everybody.
LEADFEMALE:I can relate to the festivities part, Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:All our children were conceived on special St.
SUPMALE:Olaf holidays.
LEADMALE:Adam was conceived on the Day of the Princess Pig when they had the pig crowning, and Ginella was conceived on Hay Day.
SUPMALE:That's the day we St.
LEADMALE:Olafians celebrate hay.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, do you think you could wrap this up before Rebecca goes into labor? Then there was the Day of the Wheat, when everybody came to town dressed as sandwiches.
LEADFEMALE:Charlie and I forgot to put cheese between us, and before I knew it, there was Kirsten.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Blanche, what Rebecca is doing is really not so terrible.
LEADMALE:Look, among the four of us, each of us conceived our children in a different way.
LEADFEMALE:I was totally unconscious.
SUPFEMALE:When I came to, there was Stan carving a notch in his dashboard.
LEADFEMALE:I never bought that unconscious story.
LEADFEMALE:I swear.
OTHERMALE:He must have slipped me something.
LEADMALE:Apparently.
LEADFEMALE:Those stories made me hungry.
LEADMALE:They made me horny.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll tell you what.
LEADMALE:Why don't we call the pizza guy? See, we both win.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello? What? Oh, my God! It's Ma.
LEADFEMALE:She's at the airport.
OTHERFEMALE:They caught her trying to buy a ticket out of the country.
LEADMALE:Can you believe Ma, trying to go to Sicily on my credit card? She would've made it, too, if her chef's knife hadn't shown up on the scanner.
OTHERFEMALE:You want to know something crazy? I actually feel responsible for this.
LEADFEMALE:If I'd never checked her into Shady Pines, she never would have made those s'mores, there never would have been a fire, and none of this would have happened.
LEADMALE:Hey, when you look at it like that, you are responsible.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I never had thought about it that way.
LEADMALE:You know, it is like they're trying the wrong person.
LEADMALE:It is your fault.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a second, girls.
LEADMALE:Can you imagine being the one to put your mother in jail? It was just a theory.
SUPFEMALE:Follow that lady to Guilt City.
LEADMALE:Now stop it, now stop it.
LEADMALE:Look, nobody is to blame for this.
LEADFEMALE:She's rationalizing.
SUPFEMALE:Instead of pointing fingers, I thought we were gonna try to find a way out of this.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we certainly are in the right place for it.
SUPFEMALE:The kitchen/n Crisis Central.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we sure have solved a lot of problems in this room.
SUPMALE:I mean, a lot.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, it wasn't that long ago that you Oh, it's you.
OTHERMALE:I thought maybe Sophia had come home.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:She'll be back in the morning.
LEADMALE:She's trying to teach me a lesson.
LEADMALE:I know my mother.
SUPMALE:Oh, really? You're the one who said she wasn't gonna leave in the first place.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, it's not just your mother who left.
OTHERMALE:I feel like she's my mother, too.
LEADMALE:I know, but don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:She'll be back.
LEADFEMALE:Now that she's gone, who am I gonna go to in the middle of the night with my deepest personal problems? Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:You went to my mother's room in the middle of the night? Many, many times.
LEADMALE:Two or three times a week.
SUPMALE:And she was always so kind and comforting.
SUPFEMALE:I don't understand.
LEADMALE:Every time I'd knock on her door late at night, she'd say, "Not now.
LEADFEMALE:I'm watching Bob Costas.
LEADFEMALE:" Sophia doesn't have a TV in her room.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Then, after we finished talking, she'd always give me a piece of hard candy and a kiss good night.
LEADFEMALE:I can't sleep.
OTHERFEMALE:And what's worse, I went to Sophia's room for one of our talks and then I remembered she left, thanks to you, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:You had late-night talks with my mother? All the time.
LEADMALE:And she gave you hard candy? No.
LEADFEMALE:I'd ask, but she was always afraid I'd choke on it.
LEADMALE:Why didn't somebody tell me it was dinnertime? Ma, it's not dinner, it's the middle of the night.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Then I'm dressed for it.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche is upset.
LEADMALE:Well, you would be, too, if your daughter/n Oh, I can't even say it.
SUPFEMALE:What could have happened? The two of you were getting so close.
LEADFEMALE:My little girl is gonna have a baby by artificial insemination.
SUPFEMALE:I just can't bear to think about it.
LEADMALE:I'm just being silly, aren't I? For God's sake, somebody say something.
LEADFEMALE:Ew! Big help.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, what about you? You're the sensible one around here, the free modern thinker who keeps up with the times.
LEADFEMALE:Now, what do you think? Ew.
LEADMALE:Maybe we should all get some rest and figure a way out for Sophia tomorrow.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you're probably right.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, can we look in on Sophia, too? She is like a mother to us.
SUPMALE:I think she'd like that.
LEADMALE:Here's the key.
SUPMALE:I've been thinking about what we should do in case they do send Sophia off.
OTHERMALE:What, appeal? No, a party, a prison party.
SUPMALE:I made a list of all the men we should invite.
SUPFEMALE:We'll be like the judges.
SUPMALE:"I sentence you to ten minutes with me on the lanai.
LEADMALE:" See, some can be convicts and some can be guards What are you looking at? I just cannot believe how much you think about men.
LEADMALE:Well, hey, men are an important part of my life.
SUPFEMALE:Not just my life.
LEADFEMALE:They're an important part of all our lives.
OTHERMALE:Seems like hardly a day goes by here there's not an incident about some man that we're dating or used to date or want to date.
LEADFEMALE:Pussycat, I'm going out with my friends.
LEADMALE:Can you give me some money? What happened to the money I gave you last night? Let's see, 10 bucks went for cover charge, for a round of drinks, and the other 10 went into the G-string of a very cute male dancer named Mr.
LEADMALE:Big.
LEADFEMALE:I know that guy.
SUPFEMALE:That's just a stage name.
LEADMALE:So, Ted, did I hear someone say you were a doctor? He's not just a doctor.
SUPFEMALE:He happens to be one of the top neurosurgeons in the Midwest.
SUPMALE:Get out of here.
LEADMALE:He's also heavy into real estate.
LEADFEMALE:It's nothing much, really.
OTHERMALE:I just own a few mini-malls.
SUPMALE:Oh, your wife must be very proud of you.
LEADMALE:Actually, we're divorced.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm terribly, terribly sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, girls.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, Rose, you all remember Laszlo.
LEADMALE:Of course.
SUPMALE:Laszlo, the artist from your museum.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we really enjoyed your lecture on modern sculpture.
LEADMALE:I didn't think anyone was paying attention.
OTHERMALE:We sure were.
LEADFEMALE:Especially Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:She even talked about taking up sculpting.
SUPMALE:Really, Dorothy? Oh, no, I didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, you did.
LEADMALE:You said you'd like to help him mold his clay or buff his marble anytime.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, you're such a kidder.
SUPMALE:What is sex, after all? Two clunky old bodies thrashing around against each other like animals.
OTHERMALE:You get all sweaty and flushed.
LEADFEMALE:Your hair gets mussed.
LEADMALE:You lose your breath.
LEADFEMALE:You lose your earrings.
SUPFEMALE:Your mouth waters.
LEADFEMALE:Your nose runs.
OTHERMALE:Your heart races.
SUPFEMALE:Your blood races.
SUPFEMALE:Rose? Say it, Ernie.
LEADFEMALE:It's time, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Check, please! I'm not saying I want her to go to prison.
LEADFEMALE:I'm saying if she goes to prison, we have the theme for the party.
OTHERFEMALE:Girls, do I have news for you.
OTHERMALE:Rose, where have you been? Trying to get hold of the fire inspector who inspected Shady Pines.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted to double-check there wasn't anything wrong with the building.
LEADMALE:And? And get this.
OTHERMALE:They said the inspector quit three days after the Shady Pines fire.
SUPFEMALE:It seems he mysteriously came into some money and moved to an exclusive Palm Beach neighborhood.
LEADMALE:Do you know what that means? Rose, of course I know what this means.
LEADMALE:Then will you explain it to me? It all sounded suspicious, but I couldn't quite piece it together.
OTHERMALE:Rose, you nitwit, that means the guy was probably on the take.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I told you everything would be fine, Ma.
LEADMALE:Hey, I have an idea.
LEADFEMALE:Let's have a getting-out-of-prison party.
SUPMALE:See, everybody can pretend they've been locked up for about three years and they have all this pent-up sexual energy.
OTHERFEMALE:Everybody's all pumped up because all you ever do in prison is lift weights, so we'll get all those muscle guys with homemade tattoos What are you looking at? You did a good job, but let's not forget there still has to be a trial, and Mrs.
LEADMALE:Heartgrove's confession is pretty strong.
LEADFEMALE:I just wish we had something that reflected on her credibility.
LEADFEMALE:What if we had a video of her and a friend mooning a hot dog vendor? That would totally discredit her.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:I just remembered who the friend was.
LEADFEMALE:Can't use it.
SUPMALE:Moving on.
LEADMALE:If you think of anything else, please give me a call.
LEADMALE:I have to be at the courthouse at a quarter to three.
SUPFEMALE:There's no one in the place except you and me That's what we were singing that night.
SUPMALE:We were having a couple of Nyquil shooters and singing "One For My Baby.
LEADMALE:" I remember.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you do? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I heard a smoke alarm, looked up, and saw flames coming out of the heater.
OTHERFEMALE:Maria was confused.
LEADFEMALE:I grabbed her and the hot plate and ran out.
SUPFEMALE:It was the heater.
LEADMALE:Are you sure? Sure I'm sure.
OTHERFEMALE:It was the heater.
LEADFEMALE:You dig up that hot plate, Sophia, we'll go to the D.
OTHERMALE:A.
OTHERMALE:I think we've got enough evidence to get these charges dropped.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, I am so proud of you.
LEADMALE:Now, honey, if you could just remember where you left the hot plate.
LEADMALE:I used it recently.
LEADMALE:Think, Sophia, think.
OTHERFEMALE:What's that smell?  My God.
LEADMALE:That's the smoke alarm in Sophia's room.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no! Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Anyone for s'mores? Well, Sophia, how's it feel to be home? I feel like a free man.
LEADMALE:Well, you didn't actually go to jail.
SUPMALE:OK, forget the free part.
LEADMALE:I feel like a man.
LEADFEMALE:I missed two estrogen shots, and I'm dying for a thick steak smothered in onions, a tall cold one, then going out and picking up a couple of/n Ma.
OTHERMALE:Can I tell you something, Pussycat? What? I've never been so scared.
LEADMALE:Not so much of jail.
LEADMALE:It was not being here with all of you.
LEADMALE:Only seeing you for ten minutes a day on visitors' day.
SUPMALE:That's not enough time for Rose to get one of her St.
LEADMALE:Olaf stories off the runway.
LEADMALE:All I'm trying to say is, maybe you're not much, but you're all I've got.
LEADMALE:Am I crying, Pussycat? No, Ma.
LEADMALE:I guess it wasn't as touching as I thought.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Ma, I'm just glad everything worked out.
LEADMALE:I never want to have to go through that again.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I knew it would all be OK.
LEADMALE:Rose, I think you deserve a lot of the credit.
SUPMALE:You were smart enough to double-check on that fire inspector.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:I'm proud of you, Rose.
LEADMALE:Hey, you make it sound like it's the only smart thing I ever did.
LEADFEMALE:I'll have you know I've done a lot of smart things over the years.
LEADFEMALE:Remember? 
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Oh my gosh.
SUPFEMALE:It's only one week till spring break? And I have so much to do.
LEADFEMALE:I have to get new T-shirts for the wet T-shirt contest You know, I'm actually looking forward to spring break this year.
SUPMALE:College kids.
LEADFEMALE:America's best and brightest are coming to town.
LEADMALE:It'll be nice to get mooned again.
LEADMALE:It's more than that, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:I'm talking about my school's project to get kids to read during spring vacation.
LEADFEMALE:We're putting on a series of plays based on favorite children's stories.
SUPFEMALE:And guess what.
SUPFEMALE:I have just been made producer of the first-grade production.
LEADMALE:This is all you have, Dorothy, so I'm going to be happy for you.
LEADFEMALE:No, you know, I'm really excited about this.
SUPFEMALE:We're doing Henny Penny.
SUPMALE:You know, "Help, help! The sky is falling.
SUPMALE:" Oh, that was never one of my favorites.
SUPMALE:There's no prince in it.
SUPMALE:I like a fairy tale with a nice prince in it.
LEADFEMALE:A handsome prince with a big ol' codpiece and deep dark eyes and powerful thighs and muscles rippling beneath his tunic.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, you could get aroused by "Humpty Dumpty.
LEADFEMALE:" Are you kiddin'? "All the king's horses and all the king's men.
LEADFEMALE:" Handsome men with deep dark eyes and powerful thighs and muscles and big ol' codpieces.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, how do you make it through an omelet? Ma, what are you doing? Reading the obituaries and checking out the people who died younger than I am now.
SUPFEMALE:What is it? You.
LEADMALE:What about me? You're dead.
LEADFEMALE:Say what? I told you.
LEADFEMALE:You're dead.
SUPMALE:You must be.
LEADFEMALE:It says so in the paper.
LEADMALE:"Blanche Devereaux.
LEADFEMALE:Age 68.
LEADFEMALE:"  68? Oh, that's terrible.
LEADFEMALE:They're almost as far off on your age as you are.
SUPFEMALE:I wonder how this could've happened.
LEADFEMALE:I know how it happened, 'cause I know who took that picture.
OTHERFEMALE:Chugger Dietz, the obituary editor.
LEADFEMALE:I never dreamed when I dropped him he'd be so vindictive.
LEADMALE:believe that? 68? And dead.
LEADFEMALE:Don't forget dead.
OTHERMALE:I'm going down to that newspaper this minute.
LEADFEMALE:Not only am I gonna get Chugger fired, if I hurry I can get 'em to print a retraction in this afternoon's edition.
LEADFEMALE:And dead.
LEADFEMALE:What are people gonna think? They'll think it's time to elect a new town slut.
LEADFEMALE:Mail call.
OTHERMALE:Ah, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Here's a letter for you from Palermo.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's the latest chess move from my old rival Serafina Gambrotsi.
OTHERMALE:Ma, how long has this chess game by mail been going on? What, it must be ten years now, huh? And it's going to keep on going until I beat Serafina at something.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? Picture it.
SUPFEMALE:Sicily, 1920.
LEADMALE:Serafina and I were both crazy about Marco the Goat Boy.
SUPMALE:In appearance, an Adonis.
LEADMALE:In behavior, horny as a toad.
LEADFEMALE:Little did I know he had a thing for hairy fat girls.
LEADFEMALE:If I were fatter and hairier, Dorothy, Marco the Goat Boy could've been your father.
LEADFEMALE:I think we all grieve.
OTHERMALE:Ma, that was 70 years ago.
LEADMALE:I was sure you'd forgotten.
LEADFEMALE:I forget nothing.
LEADMALE:So, any mail?  Oh, Frank.
OTHERMALE:Come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, Frank Nann.
LEADFEMALE:Frank, my mother.
SUPMALE:Hello, Frank.
SUPMALE:Ma, Frank is directing the production of Henny Penny.
LEADMALE:Not anymore I'm not.
LEADFEMALE:One of the kids in the play came down with the measles.
SUPFEMALE:Because the audience is going to be children, too, the entire cast has been quarantined.
SUPMALE:Oh, what are we gonna do? I guess we'll have to cancel.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, we can't cancel.
LEADFEMALE:First grade is when kids take an interest in reading.
LEADFEMALE:Why can't we recast it with adults? Where are we going to find an adult with the childlike naivetÃ© to play Henny Penny? Hi.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're not gonna believe it.
OTHERFEMALE:I just saw a cloud that looked exactly like a cotton ball.
OTHERFEMALE:My God, she is Henny Penny.
LEADMALE:I beg your pardon? Frank Nann, Rose Nylund.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, my entire cast has been quarantined.
SUPFEMALE:We're in a real bind.
SUPMALE:How would you like to play Henny Penny? Well, I have enjoyed playing a hen in the past.
OTHERMALE:Oh, fill us in.
SUPMALE:Parade, honeymoon or religious ceremony? Theater.
LEADFEMALE:The St.
SUPMALE:Olaf Masquers' production of Hamlet.
SUPFEMALE:I don't right off recall a hen in Hamlet.
LEADMALE:Oh, we set the play in a barnyard.
OTHERFEMALE:Luckily the symphony was out of town at the time.
LEADMALE:Can I take it then that you will play Henny Penny? I'm your chicken.
LEADMALE:Great, I'll set the oven for 425.
SUPMALE:Well, Frank Nann.
SUPMALE:I haven't seen you since that weekend in Pensacola.
SUPFEMALE:Goosey Loosey.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
OTHERFEMALE:We did have fun, Squeezy Wheezy.
SUPMALE:No, no, I mean you'd be perfect for the part of Goosey Loosey.
LEADFEMALE:We've had to recast Henny Penny.
LEADFEMALE:I'm playing Henny.
LEADMALE:Oh, and Frank's directing? Oh, what fun! I would love to.
LEADMALE:Oh, wonderful, wonderful.
SUPMALE:Then all we have to do is just order the costumes and change a few lines so that it makes sense that the two of you are playing those characters.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, listen, Dorothy, since both of your housemates are going to be in the play, why don't you play Turkey Lurkey? Oh come on.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:No, that's out of the question.
LEADFEMALE:Why? You'd be perfect.
LEADMALE:"Turkey Lurkey" was your nickname in high school.
SUPMALE:Ma, it was not.
SUPMALE:Really? That's what they called you at the PTA.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:It'll be fun.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, come on.
LEADMALE:Be a trouper.
SUPMALE:Well, I did once do a production of Showboat in high school, and everyone said I was pretty good.
LEADMALE:No one can sing "Old Man River" like my Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:Then you're saying you'll do it? Well, it is my production, and as they say, "The show must go on.
OTHERFEMALE:" Aw, Pussycat.
LEADMALE:It'll be like the old days.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, just one more time.
SUPMALE:Get a little drunk And you land in jail I still got it.
LEADFEMALE:Yes! I've got that tub of guts where I want her.
SUPMALE:My queen's knight attacks her king.
LEADFEMALE:Banzai! Ma, how did two Sicilian peasant girls ever become interested in chess? Chess is like war, only cheaper.
SUPMALE:It's the perfect game for Sicily, a country very warlike and dead-ass broke.
SUPFEMALE:Well, they printed the retraction.
OTHERMALE:Let me see it.
LEADFEMALE:I can't find it.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course you can't.
LEADFEMALE:It's way down at the bottom in itty-bitty type.
LEADFEMALE:"Our ad in yesterday's paper should have read 'Sit Well Cortisone Salve Prevents Hemorrhoids, ' not 'Presents Hemorrhoids.
LEADMALE:'" Below that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, nobody's ever gonna even see it.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody's gonna still think I'm 68.
LEADFEMALE:And dead.
OTHERMALE:Why does she keep forgetting dead? This is horrible.
SUPMALE:As Big Daddy used to say, "I'm feeling lower than the rent on a burnin' building.
LEADFEMALE:" That's funny.
LEADFEMALE:I used to live in a burning building.
LEADFEMALE:And it was cheap.
SUPFEMALE:It was Charlie's and my first house.
LEADMALE:Well, scoff if you must, but it was warm and toasty.
SUPMALE:I'll never forget Charlie throwing me over his shoulder and dashing across the threshold.
LEADMALE:Oh, it was a beautiful place.
SUPMALE:Three bedrooms, two baths.
LEADFEMALE:Then two bedrooms and one bath.
SUPFEMALE:Eventually, we outgrew the place.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, come on now.
LEADMALE:You haven't said a word since we left rehearsal.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody told me Henny Penny ended that way.
OTHERFEMALE:Nobody told me it was a tragedy.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, you've been rehearsing for three days.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you makin' a scene now? Well, that was the first time we rehearsed the ending.
LEADMALE:I didn't know that Turkey and Henny and Goosey were all eaten by Foxy Loxy.
SUPMALE:Oh, the humanity.
LEADMALE:Rose, you mean you didn't even look at the end of the play until today? If there's one thing I remember about my wedding night, it's Charlie telling me it's impolite to peek.
LEADMALE:Rose, the play isn't real.
LEADMALE:It's a fairy tale.
LEADMALE:Not all stories end happily, and children have to learn that.
LEADFEMALE:You call yourself a teacher? It's people like you who are responsible for all the evil on this planet.
LEADMALE:I guess I had that coming.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna stand by and see innocent children exposed to that horror story of unprovoked violence and ghastly death.
LEADMALE:Rose, the play goes on in two days.
LEADMALE:Well, I can't do this.
LEADMALE:You're just gonna have to get yourself another Henny Penny.
LEADMALE:Rose, honey, there's no reason to be upset about Henny Penny.
LEADFEMALE:Fairy tales just show kids how complicated life can be, and it does it on their terms.
LEADMALE:I remember when I first read Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, it had a profound influence on me.
LEADFEMALE:Seven lonely men livin' in the woods, needin' a woman.
OTHERFEMALE:All of 'em with Napoleon complexes, somethin' to prove.
LEADMALE:And jobs, Blanche.
SUPMALE:They all had jobs.
SUPFEMALE:In a diamond mine.
LEADFEMALE:All I'm trying to say is we had fairy tales in St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf that weren't violent, and they had positive role models.
LEADMALE:Like Gus and the Recliner Gunilla Gets a Catalog, and Ilsa, the Girl Who Could Make Bad Food Good.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Rose, if you don't do the part, there won't be any play.
SUPFEMALE:Now, this is a project that I care about deeply, but I don't want you doing it for my sake, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Do it for the kids.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a chance to get them reading.
LEADMALE:All right, all right, I'll do it.
LEADMALE:And not just for the kids.
SUPFEMALE:I just feel it's time I gave something back to the chicken community.
LEADMALE:After all, a chicken once saved my life.
OTHERFEMALE:They are the stupidest birds.
LEADMALE:Any mail for me? Mm, no.
LEADFEMALE:No condolence cards? Well, where's the outpouring of grief from all the many, many men whose lives I have left barren and empty? Maybe they just don't know you by your real name.
SUPMALE:Well, here it is! Serafina's next chess move.
OTHERMALE:Perfect.
LEADMALE:I already know my next move.
LEADMALE:And when Serafina sees it, her hair will fall out, her heart will stop, her eyes will burn like a thousand red-hot suns.
SUPMALE:Ma, why do you keep playing this game if you hate her so much? To relax.
LEADMALE:Flowers for Blanche Deverucks.
OTHERMALE:No, that's "Devereaux.
LEADMALE:" It's only pronounced "Deverucks" in limericks.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, Blanche, here you are.
LEADMALE:You say nobody cares about you? What do you say now? Oh! From Mel Bushman.
OTHERMALE:Good ol' Mel.
SUPMALE:The only person I can always count on.
LEADFEMALE:"Dear Blanche, when I heard of your death, "it made me realize you don't know what you have till you've lost it.
SUPFEMALE:So I'm back with my ex-wife.
LEADMALE:Love, Mel.
LEADMALE:" Now that is the most insensitive thing I have ever heard.
SUPMALE:"P.
LEADMALE:S.
OTHERMALE:Sorry I missed your birthday.
SUPFEMALE:Happy 68th.
OTHERFEMALE:" It doesn't say that.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:I made that part up.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, why are you always trying to aggravate everyone? To relax.
LEADFEMALE: "Once upon a time "on a beautiful spring day, "Henny Penny was waking up from a nap under an oak tree "when an acorn fell from the tree and hit her on the head.
LEADMALE:" Funny, when I was a little girl in Sicily and they told this story, it was a safe that fell on her head.
LEADFEMALE:"Anyway, Henny Penny being a chicken, "not the brightest bird in the world, immediately jumped to the wrong conclusion.
LEADFEMALE:" Oh, dear.
SUPFEMALE:A piece of blue sky just fell on my head The wherefore and why is best left unsaid But I have a hunch and it's appalling That like it or not, the sky is falling "Henny decided to take action.
SUPFEMALE:" I should go and warn the king! "And off she went.
LEADFEMALE:"On her way, Henny came upon Goosey Loosey" "one of the most popular birds in the barnyard.
SUPMALE:" The most popular.
LEADFEMALE:And the eighth graders are seeing a play today about how to be that popular safely.
LEADMALE:Well, Henny Penny, I do declare, honey, where are you rushing off to? The sky is falling.
LEADFEMALE:I'm off to warn the king.
SUPFEMALE:Are you sure? Of course I'm sure.
OTHERMALE:I don't need something to hit me in the head in order to get the message.
LEADMALE:Actually, in this case, it did hit me in the head.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dear! A piece of up there just landed down here You better beware, the message is clear Though millions may find the prospect galling It's run for your life, the sky is falling This is terrible.
SUPMALE:I think we best both go warn the king.
LEADMALE:"And off they went.
SUPFEMALE:"On their way, Henny Penny "and Goosey Loosey came upon Turkey Lurkey.
LEADFEMALE:" Yes, poor lonely Turkey Lurkey.
SUPMALE:Poor dateless, hopeless, self-basting/n Ma! And where are you two featherheads fluttering off to? Terrible news.
LEADFEMALE:The sky is falling! What?! A piece of it hit me in the head.
LEADMALE:Are you sure? Doesn't she act as if something hit her in the head? We're off to warn the king.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, dear! A piece of blue sky just did what they said Don't stand there and sigh Get under the bed Don't stop to complain, it's no good grumbling 'Cause this isn't rain, the sky is crumbling Oh, this is terrible news.
LEADMALE:I think we best all go warn the king.
LEADMALE:"And off they went.
SUPFEMALE:" "On their way, Henny Penny, Goosey Loosey and Turkey Lurkey came upon Foxy Loxy.
LEADFEMALE:" Ladies, ladies, why are you in such a hurry? Stop and smell the flowers.
SUPMALE:We can't.
SUPMALE:The sky is falling.
OTHERFEMALE:Run that by me once again? Ohh.
SUPFEMALE:A piece of blue sky Just fell on her head Just fell on my head The wherefore and why are best left unsaid But we have a hunch, and it's appalling That like it or not, the sky is falling Help! Disaster is near Help! We're tremblin' with fear Help.
LEADMALE:The outlook is drear We're dreadin' Armageddon may disrupt our career And though he may refuse the news we bring We must fly and try to warn the king  This is terrible news indeed.
SUPMALE:But it is good luck for all of us that we ran into each other.
LEADFEMALE:It so happens I know a shortcut to the palace.
SUPMALE:Really? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Through my den.
LEADFEMALE:There's a service entrance in the rear.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you Thank you so much.
LEADMALE:We'll never forget this.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:I lied.
LEADFEMALE:There is no service entrance.
LEADMALE:A piece of good luck just fell in my lap Three strangers who cluck, well, it's their mishap These friends who dropped in don't look suspicious But check out my grin, they look delicious To me these feathered fools are so much meat I and mine shall dine Bon appÃ©tit   "And from that day to this, "Turkey Lurkey, Goosey Loosey and Henny Penny were never seen/n" Stop! Children, kids, it's up to you.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, if you want to save us and not have us eaten by Foxy Loxy, applaud.
LEADMALE:I mean it! I mean, clap now if you want to see the goose and the chicken and the turkey live.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, put your little hands together.
LEADMALE:Save us, and you won't have bad dreams.
SUPFEMALE:Clap, you miserable/n Come on, Henny, let's get it over with.
SUPMALE:But what about their bad dreams? Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:But I just want you all to know there are monsters living under all your beds.
SUPMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think Serafina's a worthy opponent for me anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Why not, Sophia? I'm afraid she's losing it.
LEADMALE:I just got her next chess move.
LEADFEMALE:She bid four spades.
LEADMALE:Well, the reviews are finally in.
SUPFEMALE:And according to the elementary school paper, the show was a big hit.
LEADMALE:They have their own newspaper? How cute.
SUPFEMALE:Read it, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:"I saw the play yesterday.
LEADMALE:It was good.
SUPFEMALE:"It was called Henny Penny.
SUPMALE:The actors were good, especially Turkey Lurkey.
SUPMALE:" "And the others were good, too.
SUPMALE:My friends and I all liked it.
LEADFEMALE:" See, Dorothy? I knew my ending wouldn't hurt the play.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, the show was a big success.
SUPMALE:In fact the library's been busier than ever.
LEADMALE:The kids are really getting excited about reading.
SUPFEMALE:Where's Blanche? She should see this review.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes, and I hope it makes her feel better.
SUPFEMALE:I've been worried about her.
SUPFEMALE:Ever since she got those flowers from Mel Bushman, she hasn't been herself.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm off to the Rusty Anchor.
SUPMALE:Spring break comes but once a year.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:What do you think, Blanche? Am I through with my cycle? Well, I'd say menopause is a pretty good guess.
LEADMALE:You're about as puffy as the Pillsbury Doughboy.
LEADFEMALE:I was talking about my Exercycle.
OTHERFEMALE:It's so hard to know what to leave here and what to put in storage.
LEADMALE:What are you doing, Rose? Oh, I was just going through the change.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that explains the puffiness.
SUPMALE:All right, that's it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sick of this.
OTHERFEMALE:I am not puffy.
LEADMALE:And there's no similarity between me and the Pillsbury Doughboy.
SUPMALE:Understand? None!  I'll start loading the car.
SUPFEMALE:Don't take any of that.
OTHERFEMALE:That's the pile I'm keeping here.
LEADMALE:All of this? Well, I can't part with those things.
OTHERMALE:They're all so special to me.
LEADMALE:What's so special about this? Oh, look, my bullhorn! Oh, this is the only thing I have left from my one day as a Mountain Rangerette.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you, get out of the pass.
SUPMALE:This is avalanche country.
LEADMALE:What about this? You still want this old camera? Where did you find that? That was Charlie's camera.
LEADFEMALE:And it still has film in it.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I bet these are the pictures from Charlie's last birthday.
SUPMALE:I took most of our savings, and I--I bought him a couple of acres of the most beautiful land in Minnesota.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, girls, you should've seen the look on his face when it was delivered.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you what.
SUPMALE:I'll drop the film off when I pick up our tickets to the Philharmonic today.
LEADMALE:Philharmonic? Yep.
LEADFEMALE:Beethoven's Sonata No.
LEADMALE:29, one week from tonight, just you and me under the stars.
LEADMALE:Ma, aren't you excited? I'm lactating.
OTHERMALE:Ma.
LEADMALE:I forgot this.
LEADMALE:I don't want to go.
LEADMALE:Don't make me go, please.
OTHERMALE:Ma, you always loved it when we did things together.
LEADFEMALE:Why the sudden change? Don't look at me.
LEADMALE:Rose is the one going through the change.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that would explain the puffiness.
LEADFEMALE:I need some coffee.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'd love a cup, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Oh, me, too.
LEADMALE:Oh, sure, make the oldest one in the tribe serve the young.
LEADFEMALE:And after you have your fill, I'll go to the mountaintop and let the wolves eat me.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I'm worried about Ma.
LEADMALE:Why? What do you mean? Well, I picked up this pamphlet on the four warning signs of hearing loss.
OTHERFEMALE:I think Ma may be having a problem.
SUPMALE:Sophia? Warning sign number one, avoidance of social activities.
LEADMALE:Number two, people who can't hear act forgetful.
LEADFEMALE:Ma forgot about these tickets.
SUPMALE:Oh, that was just an excuse.
SUPMALE:Sophia's not really getting forgetful.
OTHERMALE:Hot coffee! Coming through! Number three, they act cranky.
SUPMALE:Ah, the hell with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Get your own coffee.
LEADFEMALE:Number four, they usually laugh out of context.
LEADFEMALE:What are you laughing at? I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you said, "My dog has no nose.
LEADFEMALE:"Well, how does he smell? Awful.
OTHERMALE:" "Awful.
OTHERFEMALE:" Nothing, huh? Well, I laughed when I thought you said it.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:How are you? Are you happy today? Oh, my God, we're being bugged.
SUPMALE:Who is it? Immigration? Ma, what are you talking about? Uh, happy? I'm I'm happy, all right, happy to be a citizen of the United States of America.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you are a citizen.
LEADMALE:That's right, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:As far as we know, I am a citizen, a citizen of the US of A, home of presidents like, um, Ford, Lincoln Help me out here, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Bush, Ma.
LEADMALE:Oh, and Reagan.
SUPMALE:Ma, I'm sorry to interrupt this flag-waving, psychotic tribute to our country,  but I think you need a hearing aid.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please, I have the hearing of a springer spaniel.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Ma, I am concerned.
SUPMALE:You're my mother.
LEADMALE:Can't you just check it out, please?  What are you laughing at? I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I thought you said, "I'm Mothra, giant radioactive insect.
OTHERMALE:"  I didn't, Ma.
LEADMALE:Too bad.
SUPFEMALE:It was a good impression.
SUPMALE:Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Dorothy, I'm kidding.
SUPFEMALE:I read that flyer you brought home.
LEADMALE:Every time you get a pamphlet, I get that disease.
OTHERMALE:And not just diseases.
LEADMALE:I thought for a while I was a Jew for Jesus.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Shalom.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, I picked up Charlie's pictures.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, these must be from his last trip to Florida.
LEADMALE:He went there every spring to discuss sales.
SUPMALE:Ah, look, here he is at Gator World.
LEADMALE:And here he is, touring the Miami suburbs.
OTHERFEMALE:And here he is in Blanche's bed.
LEADFEMALE:And here he is Wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche? Blanche Devereaux? Yeah, right here in her bed.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no! No, don't tell me he met Blanche and slept with her.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, now, wait.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure he didn't sleep with Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Well, how about this picture? Well, I mean, just because a man is in Blanche's bed doesn't mean So a guy makes one mistake.
SUPMALE:I mean, there has to be an explanation.
LEADMALE:Honey, why don't we ask Blanche? Oh, I can't talk to Blanche.
LEADMALE:When I'm upset, everything comes out wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Face it, Dorothy, I don't have your quick wit, your conversation skills, your Your way with With Words? Words.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:I'd probably end up calling her a slut.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, "slut" is a little harsh.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, Blanche isn't that bad.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God, I can barely walk.
SUPMALE:Although "slut" does have a documentary feel to it.
SUPFEMALE:You You harlot! Oh, Rose, I'm sore because I was using your Exercycle.
LEADFEMALE:I'm talking about this picture.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God, where did you find this? Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
LEADMALE:My hair, it looks like a helmet.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche! It's all bunched up and pointy.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you gotta burn this.
LEADFEMALE:I look like the Rocketeer.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, forget about your hair.
LEADMALE:That is Rose's husband with you.
LEADMALE:Who, Charlie? No, I never met Charlie.
LEADMALE:You not only met him.
SUPMALE:You slept with him, just like you sleep with everybody.
SUPFEMALE:I most certainly do not.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Blanche.
LEADMALE:You've landed on your back more than More than The American Gladiators.
LEADFEMALE:You just watch your mouth, Rose.
LEADMALE:I may be a social person, but I am certainly discerning.
LEADMALE:Discerning? Blanche, you've been under more drunken sailors than Than Oh, now, Rose, don't drag me into this.
LEADMALE:A nautical toilet.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that does it, Rose.
OTHERMALE:Now you've just gone too far.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know how he got into my room, but I can promise you, I do not go to bed with men who wear wedding bands.
SUPMALE:What if he took it off? Then I'd see the tan line.
LEADMALE:What if he was from Minnesota and had no tan? Ew! "Ew"? So he's not good enough for you? Listen, my Charlie was 6' 2" and broad shouldered and apparently had about as much taste in women as As  Other men with flawed choicing skills.
LEADMALE:Hi, Ma.
LEADFEMALE: Aha! What, "Aha"? You didn't hear that.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, I was just trying to be polite, but since you brought it up, excuse you.
SUPMALE:Ma, you didn't hear that.
LEADFEMALE:Now, face it, you can't hear high frequencies.
OTHERMALE:Why can't you be honest about what's happening to you? Why do you insist on becoming feeble? Feeble? Now, you listen, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I may not have your gift for word jumbles or your ability to float or your way of making small children weep But? Or your butt.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:But there's one thing I do have.
SUPMALE:Oh, what's that, Ma? Two thousand shares of Xerox, which I bought at My health.
LEADMALE:I've got my health.
SUPMALE:Listen, Ma, I made an appointment for you for 2:00 this afternoon.
SUPMALE:Either you go and get your hearing checked, or I will make life miserable for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:You said the exact same things to me before you took me to Shady I'll go pretty up.
SUPFEMALE:Rose? Rose.
OTHERMALE:Don't talk to me.
LEADFEMALE:Don't try to cheer me up.
OTHERFEMALE:Just leave me alone.
OTHERFEMALE:I am angry, and I'm gonna stay angry!  Stop it! Dorothy, it just doesn't make sense.
LEADMALE:Why was Charlie with that tramp if he didn't sleep with her? Now, come on.
LEADMALE:Blanche might be a little loose, but she's not a tramp.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, here they are.
LEADMALE:The names of all the men I have dated since my husband died.
LEADMALE:What do you know? The tramp keeps records.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, most of the men in these pages just fantasized about going to bed with me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, what do the gold stars mean? I had a good time.
LEADFEMALE:What do the silver stars mean? I ran out of gold stars.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:If you didn't sleep with any of the men in these journals, then how come it says "Bed" on the cover?  Oh, that doesn't say "Bed.
OTHERMALE:" Right there, it does.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, silly, those are my initials.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche Elizabeth Devereaux.
SUPFEMALE:Your initials spell "Bed"? Okay, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:You said eight years ago, spring? That starts right here.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna prove to you I am not a sexually indiscriminate person.
SUPMALE:Or her name isn't "Bed.
LEADMALE:" Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:It says right there you slept with a traveling salesman.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, in fairness, it says that on her license plates.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
SUPMALE:There.
LEADMALE:"Chuck.
LEADFEMALE:" A traveling salesman named Chuck.
OTHERMALE:Well, that must be him.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Rose, I'm so sorry.
LEADMALE:I did.
LEADFEMALE:It's right there in the diary.
LEADFEMALE:I must have I must have slept with your husband, Charlie.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, so what's the news? How'd the hearing test come out?  Tell her what the doctor said.
SUPMALE:Tell her what the doctor Ma's fine, okay? And? I need a hearing aid, all right? I took the test just to show her there was nothing to it, and it turns out I have a slight hearing loss.
LEADFEMALE:And get this.
OTHERMALE:It's inherited, and it skips a generation.
SUPFEMALE:Skips a generation! Yahoo! Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:That is not true.
OTHERFEMALE:You're just gonna gloat about this, aren't you? This is nothing but a big victory for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, I am not gonna get a hearing aid, and that's all there is to it.
OTHERMALE:But, Dorothy, you're the one who's been talkin' about aging with dignity.
LEADMALE:Not for me.
LEADFEMALE:For her.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, look at her.
LEADMALE:The woman is hundreds of years old.
LEADFEMALE:She should be carbon-dated.
SUPMALE:But, Dorothy, if the doctor said Look, I really don't want to hear this, okay? Good news, you can't.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose.
LEADMALE:Rose, what are you doing? Oh, she can't face me.
LEADFEMALE:She's been doin' this all day.
SUPMALE:Rose, you know I said I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Can't you put yourself in my position? Apparently I'm not limber enough.
LEADFEMALE:That was good.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I know what happened between you and Charlie happened before you ever knew me, and I know I shouldn't be so angry, but I am and I just can't help it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Take it easy, Rose.
OTHERMALE:How can I? What do you think this makes me feel like? What? She said, "What do you think this makes me feel like?" Ma! It's out of the park.
OTHERFEMALE:Game over.
LEADMALE:I'm going to Disneyland.
OTHERMALE:How come she gets to go to Disneyland? Rose, Dorothy needs a hearing aid, but she won't get one because she's afraid she'll feel old.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't get it.
SUPMALE:When did I become my parents' age? Gosh, you know, I remember being 20 years old and--and worrying that if I didn't spend the holidays at home, I might never see them again.
SUPFEMALE:Everything changes so suddenly.
SUPFEMALE:You know what's young to me now? Forty.
SUPFEMALE:Suddenly, 40 is young.
LEADMALE:Oh, aren't you sweet.
SUPFEMALE:Every day it's something else.
LEADMALE:The hair gets gray.
LEADMALE:The eyes get weak.
LEADFEMALE:And you shrink.
SUPMALE:It's scary.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you measure your height against your arm span, and when they stop being equal, you're actually getting smaller.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Anyway, Dorothy, these new hearing aids just fit right in the ear canal.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody can even see 'em, so what does it matter? It matters because it's a step I don't want to take.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I don't mind being divorced or having to struggle to pay my bills or having to eat my weight in supplements every morning, but I will not do this.
SUPMALE:I will not become an old person.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooh, rain's coming.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, it's the middle of September.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? Oh, it's a banner Charlie made.
OTHERMALE:I thought it'd be nice to have some good memories of him around me.
LEADMALE:He put it up every year.
LEADMALE:Oh, he was one of a kind, all right.
LEADMALE:Loved Christmas.
SUPMALE:Loved Christmas.
SUPMALE:That is unique.
SUPMALE:Of course, that was before he met Blanche.
LEADMALE:Pretty, affectionate, fun-loving Blanche.
SUPMALE:Say, where is old Happy-pants? She and Ma went to the Philharmonic.
OTHERMALE:I thought you were going to that.
LEADMALE:Why bother? It's not like I'd be able to enjoy it.
SUPFEMALE:True.
SUPFEMALE:On the other hand, Beethoven was also deaf, so you'd be hearing the music the way he wrote it.
LEADMALE:Look at us.
OTHERFEMALE:You haven't been out of the house in a week, and I've lost one of my best friends.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:You haven't lost one of your best friends.
LEADMALE:Sure I have.
LEADMALE:It's too painful to talk to Blanche, so I figure she can be my landlord, but we'll stop being friends.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, now, Rose, that's not what you really want.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you're sacrificing something very important to you over a mistake that was made years ago.
SUPMALE:Honey, you know what you should do? Sit down, write down everything that you like about Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, if you care for someone, it's important to remember why they're in your life.
LEADFEMALE:I guess you're right.
LEADMALE:I guess I was pretty hard on her.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe I made that crack about the nautical toilet.
LEADMALE:You lost your head.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm having a vision.
SUPMALE:A religious vision.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, God, it's so beautiful! Sophia, please, our Savior wouldn't be caught dead in that outfit.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess I ought to go talk to Rose.
OTHERMALE:Where is she? In the kitchen.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Is she still upset? Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:You know, I just don't understand it.
SUPMALE:How could I not remember Charlie? Have I finally turned that corner? Have I finally become so jaded that I can no longer put the name with the face? Oh, listen to me.
LEADMALE:He was probably just lousy in bed.
SUPMALE:You missed a sensational concert tonight.
LEADMALE:I'm glad I didn't go tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Who needs the crowds, the hassle? You're sounding old, pussycat.
SUPMALE:It's not a hearing aid that makes you old.
SUPFEMALE:It's what you're becoming by not getting one.
LEADFEMALE:Think of what you're missing, all the things I hear.
LEADMALE:The birds singing, the wind in the trees, the sound of the ticker tape telling you Xerox has gone up to My health.
SUPMALE:Did I mention I've got my health? Rose Don't say anything.
SUPMALE:I've given this a lot of thought.
SUPFEMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Rose No, shh.
OTHERMALE:You listen.
SUPFEMALE:Charlie was the most important man in my life, but as much as I cared about him, I can't help but care about you, too.
LEADMALE:You're like a sister to me, and I can't throw that away, so I forgive you for being a moralless, emotionally needy, man-leech with an air bag in her headboard.
SUPMALE:And I'm sorry I said you were insensitive.
SUPMALE:Apology accepted.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Dorothy, hand me those pictures.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's time we rip them up.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Rose, have you seen the rest of these pictures? I'd rather not.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, I think there's some mistake.
LEADFEMALE:Look, here's Blanche in bed with Charlie, but this one's Blanche in bed with a pontoon boat.
LEADMALE:Here's Blanche in bed with the big orange from the Sunkist building, and here's Blanche in bed with the Country Bear Jamboree.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, do you know what this means? I sure do.
LEADMALE:My God, you're an animal! Rose, these are double exposures.
SUPMALE:Double exposures? Yes, obviously Blanche took pictures with the camera over film that was already in it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, how strange! And what a great alibi for the future.
SUPMALE:But wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:What were you doing taking pictures of yourself in bed? You've seen her Christmas cards.
SUPMALE:Well, I've got two tickets here for the final night of the Philharmonic, and one of them has your name on it.
LEADFEMALE:Here you go, Opus.
LEADMALE:I thought you two went last night.
SUPMALE:I traded those for these.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, last night we went to see Dying Young.
LEADFEMALE:Terrific.
LEADMALE:I laughed till I peed.
SUPMALE:And then I laughed at that.
LEADFEMALE:So you mean you just pretended to go to the concert so I'd realize what I've been missing, how stupid I've been? Now will you go in and get a hearing aid? You're too late, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:I already did.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm wearing one now.
SUPFEMALE:You got it? Why, that's wonderful.
LEADMALE:Terrific, honey.
LEADFEMALE:And the great thing is, you can't even see it.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're beautiful.
LEADMALE:I told you, to me, you've always had the elegance of a young Lauren Bacall.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank you, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:A young Bacall.
OTHERFEMALE:Amazing.
LEADFEMALE:Sixty years old and she still falls for that "young Bacall" bit.
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:I heard that.
SUPFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, morning, Ma.
SUPMALE:How'd you sleep? Pretty good.
SUPMALE:I dreamed I was making love to Jay Leno.
SUPFEMALE:That's a strange dream for you to have.
LEADFEMALE:Not really.
LEADFEMALE:It was Monday night, and he was filling in for Carson.
SUPFEMALE:Mornin', all.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, honey, how was your date last night? Oh, unforgettable.
OTHERFEMALE:Mel Bushman and I were coming back from a champagne picnic at Sunset Beach.
SUPMALE:We ran out of gas in the middle of nowhere.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my goodness! What did you do? You name it.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, you got a call last night from something called the Maltese Falcon Club.
LEADMALE:Oh, good.
LEADMALE:Remember I was asked to select the activity for the museum staff's annual outing? Yesterday, I signed us up for a murder-mystery weekend at the Queen of the Keys Hotel.
OTHERMALE:You mean, the kind of thing where mock murders are committed and then the guests try to solve them? Exactly.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm-hmm.
OTHERFEMALE:That sounds like fun.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, back in Minnesota, I was known as the Sherlock Holmes of St.
LEADMALE:Olaf.
LEADFEMALE:Figured out which one was Shinola, did you, Rose? The hard way.
LEADMALE:I sure hope this weekend is a success.
LEADMALE:It could give me a shot at becoming Kendall Nesbitt's new assistant.
LEADMALE:Who's Kendall Nesbitt? Oh, he's the museum's director of acquisitions.
SUPMALE:If I got this job, it would mean going to Europe with him to look for rare paintings and antiques.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if he has an eye for antiques, you should be a shoo-in.
LEADMALE:Look who's calling the vase Ming.
SUPFEMALE:There's just one hitch.
SUPMALE:I need three more people to get the group rate at the hotel.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought hotels always gave you the group rate.
SUPMALE:Yeah, sweetheart, but this is for the whole night.
LEADMALE:Is there any chance I could persuade you girls to join me for a murder-mystery weekend? Blanche, are you kidding? I have read every word Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler ever wrote.
LEADMALE:Now, Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe have become a part of me.
OTHERFEMALE:"She had more curves than the Monaco Grand Prix "and was twice as dangerous.
LEADFEMALE:"Her jewelry was mute testimony "that Charlie Chaplin wasn't the only tramp "who hit it big in this town.
SUPMALE:" You do this on first dates, don't you, Dorothy? Does this mean you'll go? Of course we'll go.
OTHERMALE:Sure, anything for a friend.
OTHERFEMALE:What the heck.
LEADMALE:I'll go, too.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, like you had a choice.
SUPFEMALE:When do you think the mysteries are gonna start? You want a mystery? You should have tried the pink dressing at the salad bar.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, jeez, the mystery continues.
LEADMALE:Now, girls, remember, look everyone over very carefully.
LEADFEMALE:Try to figure out who are the real guests and who are actors pretending to be guests.
LEADMALE:It'll help when it comes to solving the mysteries.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:If that's your real name.
SUPMALE:How is that coffee? Terrific! Actor.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, you're wearing my earrings.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know that.
SUPFEMALE:But when I asked you before where they were, you said you didn't know, and now you're wearing them.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Rose, there could be two explanations.
LEADMALE:Either I was lying, or I was wrong about the number of explanations.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche.
SUPMALE:Oh, Kendall.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I must commend you again.
LEADFEMALE:I have a feeling we're in for a weekend none of us is going to forget.
SUPMALE:Oh, I do declare, your sweet words could charm the mornin' dew right off of the honeysuckle.
LEADMALE:That was good, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Now, do Br'er Rabbit.
LEADFEMALE:I believe the fun is about to begin.
OTHERFEMALE:Ladies.
LEADFEMALE:I think I got to him, don't you? Your eyes are as good as rolled back.
SUPMALE:I do believe that things are gonna turn out even better than I Oh, Kendall is sitting down with Posey MacGlinn.
SUPFEMALE:She is my main rival for that assistant's job.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look at the shameless way she's flirtin' with him.
LEADMALE:Disgustin'.
SUPFEMALE:You flirted with him.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm from the South.
LEADMALE:Flirting is part of my heritage.
SUPMALE:What do you mean? Her mother was a slut, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure we all join his son, his daughter and his new bride, Candy, in wishing many returns of the day to our friend and patron for 40 years, Giles Forsythe.
SUPMALE:  My God! They've been murdered! Does this mean we don't get any birthday cake? Please, nobody touch anything.
LEADMALE:My name is Spade Marlowe.
LEADMALE:I'm a private detective retained by the late philanthropist, Giles Forsythe, because when an 88-year-old man marries a 22-year-old girl, he likes to know what she's up to.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry to interrupt, but does anybody but me think the hat's a little precious?  Today was Giles Forsythe's birthday, and he intended as always to celebrate by having dinner here with his son, Philip, a well-known collector of pre-Columbian artifacts, his spinster daughter, Gloria, and of course his new bride, Candy.
SUPFEMALE:I've failed to protect my client, but I am determined, with your help, to solve these crimes and bring the murderer to justice.
LEADMALE:Maybe that bloody dagger will lead us to the murder weapon.
SUPFEMALE:St.
LEADMALE:Olaf? Boy, he is good.
LEADMALE:Unusual knife.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah, cut the cake.
LEADFEMALE:I recognize that.
LEADMALE:It's a rare Mayan sacrificial dagger.
LEADFEMALE:That could prove to be significant.
LEADMALE:Undoubtedly the weapon used to kill Mrs.
LEADMALE:Forsythe, but obviously her husband was shot.
LEADMALE:Then there must be a gun.
SUPFEMALE:South side? Uncanny.
LEADFEMALE:Do you mind? Go right ahead.
LEADMALE:You won't find anything.
SUPMALE:What I believe they refer to as a purse gun, and it's been recently fired.
LEADMALE:I don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, you now have enough clues to solve these murders.
LEADMALE:Who did it, how and why? The butler did it! I'm a maitre d'.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:The maitre d' did it! Philip did it! Gloria did it! It was Colonel Mustard in the library with the candlestick.
SUPMALE:Oh, she says, "The butler did it," and I'm the idiot? The answer is obvious.
OTHERFEMALE:They both did it.
LEADMALE:Oh, now, if Miss Smarty solves the crime, she'll make a big impression on Kendall, and I can just kiss that job goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Philip was a collector of pre-Columbian relics.
LEADFEMALE:Candy had her throat cut with a Mayan dagger.
LEADMALE:He killed her.
LEADMALE:The gun was in Gloria's purse.
LEADFEMALE:She killed her father.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice try, ma' am, but Philip and Gloria are innocent of those crimes.
LEADMALE:Perhaps, but they are both murderers.
SUPFEMALE:Sit down, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Don't make a fool of yourself.
SUPFEMALE:Would you care to explain? In the first place, it is unlikely that Gloria murdered her father.
LEADMALE:Statistics show that patricide is overwhelmingly a male crime.
LEADMALE:Although daughters frequently murder their mothers! If Gloria had killed her father, would she then have tried to conceal the weapon in her purse? Ladies and gentlemen, I think not.
SUPMALE:That gun was obviously planted in her purse to pin the murder on her.
LEADFEMALE:I've got it! A maitre d' is some kind of waiter.
LEADMALE:On the other hand, Philip would never pick a Mayan sacrificial knife as a murder weapon.
LEADFEMALE:Too obvious.
SUPMALE:But it would be no problem for his sister to sneak the weapon out of his collection.
OTHERMALE:This woman's pathetic! Oh, big news.
LEADFEMALE:Tear out the front page.
LEADMALE:Notice that the dagger was found to the left of the victim.
LEADMALE:A throat A throat is almost always cut from behind.
LEADFEMALE:Not part of the show, people.
LEADMALE:Not part of the show.
OTHERFEMALE:Being right-handed, I would slash from left to right.
LEADMALE:But from the fact that the murder weapon was dropped to the left of the victim, we can deduce that the murderer is left-handed.
SUPFEMALE:Notice that Gloria, like most left-handed people, wears her wristwatch on her right wrist.
LEADFEMALE:I think it is painfully clear that Philip and Gloria both planned murders, and each meant to pin it on the other.
SUPMALE:They knew that the lights would be turned off when the cake appeared because that happens every year.
LEADMALE:Coincidence? Ha! Siblings often think alike.
LEADFEMALE:You've given us a who, a how and a "Ha.
LEADMALE:" But what about why? What's the motive? When a 22-year-old marries an 88-year-old, chances are she's not after his body.
LEADMALE:Oh, boy.
OTHERFEMALE:Gloria and Philip were both afraid that Candy would persuade the old man to change his will, and they both hoped that pinning the crime on the other would make them the sole inheritor.
LEADMALE:Well, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, the who, how and why.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, that was a real Tour de France.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, thank you, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:Girls, guess what? Kendall just told me he needs to be alone with me.
SUPFEMALE:What did you do? Well, what else? I gave him my key to our room.
LEADFEMALE:Now, let me have yours, Rose.
OTHERMALE:You can bunk with Dorothy and Sophia tonight.
SUPMALE:But we were gonna be roomies.
SUPMALE:Either you're bunkin' with them, or you can sleep in the closet.
LEADMALE:Closet? Give me that key.
SUPFEMALE:Coming, Kendall.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Compliments of Mr.
SUPMALE:Nesbitt.
LEADMALE:Well, how sweet.
LEADMALE:I'll take it.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
OTHERMALE:I've got it, ma'am.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God! Oh, my God!  It's all right.
LEADFEMALE:What is this all about? He's dead! Blanche, calm down.
OTHERMALE:This is undoubtedly just another part of the mystery weekend.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? He looks pretty dead to me.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Ma, give me your mirror.
LEADFEMALE:What for? Every morning I hold it under Ma's nose.
SUPFEMALE:If it fogs up, I start the coffee.
SUPMALE:No breath.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:He's dead.
SUPMALE:Oh, God.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Vaczy, hotel security.
LEADMALE:Nobody touch anything.
LEADMALE:You say no one was in the room but her and the victim? That's right, sir.
SUPFEMALE:He's dead, all right.
SUPMALE:Steak knife right through the heart.
LEADMALE:That must be what killed him.
LEADMALE:St.
SUPFEMALE:Olaf? It's like I'm wearing a sign.
LEADMALE:I want everybody out of this room.
LEADMALE:I'm clearing it till the police get here.
SUPFEMALE:And nobody leaves the hotel, especially you.
LEADFEMALE:As of now, you're the only suspect.
LEADMALE:If they put me in prison, I'll be brave.
LEADMALE:I can handle it.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, you don't understand.
LEADMALE:They'll put you in a women's prison.
LEADMALE:Don't let me go, Dorothy! Don't let me go! Honey, you are not going to go because you are not guilty.
LEADFEMALE:I understand you can have anything for your last meal.
LEADMALE:Just ice cream, if you want.
OTHERMALE:I think I'm gonna be sick.
SUPFEMALE:You're not helping, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:It's almost as though you believe Blanche is guilty.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she lied about my earrings, and she took them.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, deceit, then theft.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't murder the next logical step? St.
LEADMALE:Olaf, right? Face it, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Blanche was discovered in a locked room.
LEADFEMALE:Only she and the victim had keys.
LEADMALE:I mean, give me another explanation.
LEADMALE:The trouble is, I can't.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:You figured out that mystery at dinner.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma, that was a game.
LEADFEMALE:This is life.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's right.
LEADFEMALE:You've never been good at life.
LEADMALE:How can I be accused of murder? I am a Devereaux.
SUPFEMALE:Things like this usually happen to people named Petrillo.
SUPFEMALE:I take offense at that.
SUPFEMALE:No one in my family ever, ever left a body to be found.
LEADMALE:Okay, I'm Lieutenant Alvarez, Dade County Homicide, and here's what I got.
SUPFEMALE:At around 9:45 last night, this guy went to Room 405, carrying champagne ordered by Nesbitt.
SUPFEMALE:He was admitted by Blanche Devereaux and discovered the corpse.
LEADMALE:Now, Ms.
LEADMALE:Devereaux and this dead guy had the only two keys.
OTHERFEMALE:Forensics say that the cause of death was a stab wound inflicted by a steak knife.
OTHERMALE:We know Ms.
SUPFEMALE:Devereaux had steak for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Given these facts, unless somebody has something else, we got enough to make an arrest.
SUPFEMALE:My, my, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Officer.
LEADMALE:I do declare, your sweet words could charm the mornin' dew right off the honeysuckle.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, not now.
LEADMALE:If not now, when? Blanche Devereaux Wait, wait! You haven't established a motive.
LEADFEMALE:You want a motive? I'll give you a motive.
SUPFEMALE:That woman gave Kendall her room key.
SUPFEMALE:I saw her do it.
SUPFEMALE:Her plan was to seduce him to insure that she would win the job as his assistant.
LEADMALE:Then she got the other key to the room from that woman there.
LEADFEMALE:She--She rushed up to the room.
LEADMALE:She tore off her clothes.
LEADFEMALE:That's Velcro.
LEADFEMALE:It just gives the illusion of a tear.
LEADMALE:She flung her dress on the bed.
SUPFEMALE:She slipped into a negligee and awaited her prey.
LEADFEMALE:What she didn't realize was the reason that Kendall went to her room, the reason Kendall ordered the champagne, was to let her down easy.
LEADFEMALE:He'd already promised the job to me.
SUPMALE:And the reason he went to her room, rather than having her come to his, was that I was sharing his room.
LEADFEMALE:Slut! When Kendall told her the truth, she flew into a jealous rage.
LEADMALE:She plunged the steak knife into his chest.
SUPFEMALE:That tramp murdered my lover! I know Blanche Devereaux, Lieutenant, and this tramp is incapable of committing murder.
SUPMALE:Okay, we got a motive, we got a weapon, and we got one suspect with no alibi.
LEADMALE:Blanche Devereaux, I'm charging you with murder.
LEADFEMALE:You have the right to remain Wait, wait! Why would she bring a steak knife to what she thought was a romantic liaison? It could've been for anything.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not familiar with her sexual proclivities.
OTHERFEMALE:What, are you a rookie? You still haven't answered the question of how somebody else got into the room.
OTHERMALE:What if there was a knock at the door? Nesbitt might have assumed that it was the waiter with the champagne.
LEADFEMALE:That is speculation.
LEADFEMALE:But one more point.
LEADMALE:The hotel security chief cordoned off the room, so the only people who saw the room after the murder, other than you and your staff, were the waiter, the security chief, and the four of us.
LEADMALE:So? So when Miss MacGlinn was reconstructing the murder scene, she described Blanche's dress being slung over the bed.
SUPMALE:It was.
LEADFEMALE:I saw it.
LEADMALE:But Miss MacGlinn could only have seen it if she'd been there prior to the murder.
SUPFEMALE:I think I see now how it happened.
OTHERFEMALE:Last evening, at dinner, when Miss MacGlinn saw Blanche give Kendall Nesbitt her key, she was furious.
LEADFEMALE:She dropped a steak knife into her purse.
LEADMALE:Big deal, I took a whole place setting.
LEADFEMALE:Not now, Ma! And when she felt that she wouldn't be missed, she slipped out of the dining room and headed upstairs.
SUPMALE:Kendall had let himself into Blanche's room while she was in the shower and was making himself comfortable when there was a knock at the door.
LEADFEMALE:Thinking it was the champagne, he opened the door.
SUPFEMALE:Posey was there.
SUPMALE:She accused him of two-timing.
SUPMALE:He denied it.
LEADMALE:Posey pulled out a steak knife, plunged it into his chest and left the room before Blanche could discover her.
SUPFEMALE:Jealous rage was the motive, all right, but Blanche wasn't the murderer.
LEADFEMALE:There's your murderer, Posey MacGlinn.
LEADMALE:Well, Miss MacGlinn, what do you have to say now? Dorothy Zbornak, you've stuck your nose in for the last time!    Posey MacGlinn, I charge you with the murder of Kendall Nesbitt.
LEADMALE:Lieutenant Alvarez, I don't think that'll be necessary, as I seem to have recovered from my death, but I would like to thank the Maltese Falcon Club and, in particular, Blanche Devereaux for giving us a weekend we'll never forget.
LEADMALE:Thank you for coming.
LEADMALE:So wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:You mean those guys were all in on it? I was in on it, too.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, you were not.
SUPMALE:Oh, all right.
OTHERFEMALE:I was not.
SUPMALE:Damn it, I just hate to be the brunt of jokes.
LEADMALE:Funny, you don't mind being the brunt of limericks.
LEADMALE:That's different.
LEADFEMALE:That's poetry.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:There's one thing I don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:When I checked to make sure that Kendall was really dead, why didn't his breath show up on your mirror? Simple.
LEADFEMALE:The mirror had been sprayed with defogger.
SUPFEMALE:But who could have done that? I did.
OTHERMALE:The people at the club asked me to.
OTHERMALE:Well, Rose, why would you do such a cruel thing to me? Well, Blanche, there could be two explanations.
LEADMALE:Either I was getting back at you for taking my earrings or Oh, who are we kidding? That's why I did it.
LEADMALE:This whole thing is just unbelievable.
LEADFEMALE:Kendall, you're not dead, and I didn't kill anybody.
OTHERFEMALE:And I didn't take any silverware.
LEADFEMALE:Does this mean I'm still in the runnin' for the job? Of course you are.
SUPMALE:Oh, well So this was all a mockery, a sham.
LEADMALE:No crimes were committed at all.
SUPMALE:What a load of fun.
SUPFEMALE:Pussycat, help me carry my purse to the car.
SUPMALE:
SUPMALE:You rang? I want a cracker.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll need something to wash it down, and a twist of lemon would be nice.
SUPFEMALE:What is it now? Habit.
SUPFEMALE:Give me that.
SUPMALE:Listen, Ma, I've made a decision.
OTHERMALE:I think we're gonna have to get a nurse to take care of you until you're well.
LEADFEMALE:A nurse? Why can't you take care of me? Normally, I would, but I have that education conference starting Tuesday.
LEADMALE:And Blanche is busy with her granddaughter, and Rose is Well, I just think a nurse is the way to go.
LEADMALE:I don't need a nurse.
OTHERMALE:I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really? Then why have you been running me ragged doing things for you? Honestly? It tickles me.
LEADMALE:Look, Ma, I'm hiring a nurse.
LEADFEMALE:At your age, we can't take any injury for granted.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's your fault I sprained both my ankles.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, you were the one who sneezed and blew yourself off the stool.
LEADMALE:It wouldn't have happened if you'd let me sit at the table that night.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Ma, you know the rules.
SUPFEMALE:When we eat Mexican food, you sit at the counter.
OTHERMALE:Now, it's settled.
OTHERMALE:I'll have a nurse here tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Wouldn't it be cheaper just to set me adrift on some ice floe? If it were, do you think you'd still be here? Oh, hi.
LEADFEMALE:We're back.
OTHERMALE:Oh, hi, honey.
LEADMALE:And what did you do today? Grandma took me down to the docks to watch the sailors come in.
SUPMALE:I remember spending that quality wharf time with my grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and guess what? Grandma gave me a new nickname to call her in front of the Navy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, what was that? Sis.
SUPFEMALE:Sis? Well, she calls her other grandmother "Grandma".
OTHERMALE:This just cuts down on the confusion.
SUPFEMALE:Run along, darling.
SUPFEMALE:Run along.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, girls, I'm just so worried.
LEADMALE:You've got to help me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so concerned about Melissa.
LEADFEMALE:Why? What's wrong? I'm just afraid I had a lot more fun this afternoon than she did.
LEADMALE:And I promised Janet her little girl would have fun this week.
SUPMALE:I swear, I have no idea how to keep her entertained.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, the important thing is to spend time with her.
LEADMALE:Why don't you do something that both of you enjoy? Why don't you take her to the movies, to the beach? Why don't you take her to the petting zoo? The Petting Zoo? Dorothy, even I don't go to that club anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Girls, I've got big news.
LEADMALE:I found something Melissa and I can do together.
SUPFEMALE:I have entered her in the Little Miss Miami pageant.
SUPFEMALE:And we're a cinch to win, aren't we? Hit it, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, my name's Melissa, and I'm five years old.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, she's seven.
LEADMALE:No, that works out to be five in Blanche years.
SUPFEMALE:Look at this face, girls.
OTHERMALE:How could a child this gorgeous lose? I think it's a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure it is, if you like the notion of children competing in a bloodthirsty, winner-take-all contest, where what's on the outside is considered more important than what's on the inside.
OTHERMALE:Lost the Little Miss St.
LEADMALE:Olaf pageant, did you? Twenty-three years in a row.
LEADMALE:Once they picked Eileen Ditmeyer's imaginary playmate over me.
LEADMALE:Well, sure, she was more talented, but still, I smelled a rat.
LEADFEMALE:You mean the contest was fixed? No, that was my talent.
LEADMALE:Smelling rats.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I'm not sure that this is a good idea, either.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, beauty pageants are archaic and sexist, not to mention degrading.
LEADMALE:Lost the Little Miss Brooklyn contest, did you? I practiced that trombone for weeks! And there was Ma sitting in the front row, sucking a lemon.
LEADMALE:Well, you were just nervous because your mother was in the front row.
LEADFEMALE:She was a judge.
LEADFEMALE:Well, come along, Melissa, we have a lot of work to do if we're gonna win.
LEADFEMALE:But we can still go to the circus this week, right? Well, we'll see.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, the pageant is just a few days away.
LEADMALE:You can go to that circus any old time.
SUPFEMALE:How many years can you enter the Little Miss contest? Evidently, twenty-three.
SUPFEMALE:At least my mother voted for me.
OTHERMALE:Ah, Nurse DeFarge, right on time.
LEADMALE:Of course I'm right on time.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm always on time.
SUPFEMALE:You know what happens when a nurse is late? People die.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, let's get the party started.
LEADMALE:Uh, this is my friend, Rose Nylund.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go get Ma.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure she's anxious to get reacquainted.
SUPMALE:Oh, then you've known Sophia before? Yes, she was one of the residents a few years ago at a place I worked called Shady Pines.
LEADMALE:But to tell you the truth, I don't think that she'll remember me.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, I'm sure you  I hope that doesn't make you uncomfortable.
LEADMALE:Ma, what are you doing? I'm rolling for my life.
LEADMALE:You hired the Angel of Death from Shady Pines.
LEADMALE:Ma, don't be ridiculous.
LEADMALE:She is not the Angel of Death.
LEADFEMALE:She is a private nurse with excellent references.
SUPMALE:And for the last time, Shady Pines is a very reputable rest home.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling you, Dorothy, they used to pre-sell our bodies to medical schools.
OTHERMALE:That was the big joke, "How would you like to go to college?" Now, where's my patient? Don't you mean victim? Ma! Now, look, Sophia, I know you didn't like it at Shady Pines.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody did after their families dumped them there.
LEADMALE:But I'm sure if you just give me a chance, we'll become fast friends.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, I really wish you'd respect my feelings about this.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, I really wish you had voted for me in the Little Miss Brooklyn pageant.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I calls 'em as I sees 'em.
SUPMALE:Now, ladies, please.
SUPMALE:Sophia, I'm just here to take care of you.
SUPFEMALE:You want your back rubbed? I'm here.
LEADFEMALE:A glass of water? Call me.
LEADMALE:My job is just to see to each and every one of your needs.
LEADFEMALE:Will you excuse us? I have to talk something over with my daughter.
LEADMALE:Of course.
LEADMALE:You see, Ma You rang? You're hired.
LEADMALE:Well, it won't be a stylish marriage I can't afford a carriage  But you'll look sweet upon a seat Of a bicycle built for two Oh, my God, they've bonded.
LEADMALE:Hey! What are you doing? We were going to watch The Nun's Story.
LEADMALE:I've never seen it before.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, she leaves the convent in the end.
LEADFEMALE:Here it is, Ironside.
LEADMALE:He's the master of the wheelchair.
LEADMALE:Just look at the way he takes those corners.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on.
SUPFEMALE:The guy's got radials.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, we were watching something else.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Sophia wants to watch Ironside, and I believe a happy patient is a healthy patient.
LEADMALE:He's a fine detective, isn't he, Sophia? Oh, please, call me Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Ma? Not you.
LEADFEMALE:Popcorn, Ma? Oh, no, it gets caught in my teeth.
LEADFEMALE:I tell you what, I'll floss them while you nap.
LEADMALE:You're a good kid.
LEADFEMALE:You want plain floss or mint-flavored? Surprise me.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I'm serious.
LEADFEMALE:You have got to get rid of that woman.
SUPMALE:Look She just bosses us all around, won't let us have any fun, make any noise.
LEADFEMALE:She's makin' our lives miserable.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like her any more than you do, but what can I do? Ma's ankles haven't healed yet.
LEADFEMALE:And besides, Nurse DeFarge means well.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, at 2:00 a.
OTHERFEMALE:m.
LEADFEMALE:this morning, I was entertaining a gentleman caller when she opened the door at the most inopportune time.
LEADMALE:I could have lost my balance and chipped a tooth.
SUPMALE:You think that's annoying? She came into my room last night when I was reenacting the gangplank scene from Peter Pan.
SUPFEMALE:What the hell goes on at night in this house? Look, I know you are both upset, but nothing I have heard is grounds for firing the woman.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, excuse me, ladies.
LEADMALE:Oh, by the way, Dorothy, a man called wanting to know if you were free Saturday night, but I forgot to write down the number.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:Hasta la vista, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma, is this the one you said you liked? Oh, yes, isn't that just beautiful? Girls, look.
SUPFEMALE:This is one of her outfits for the pageant.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm telling you, she's gonna win this thing hands down.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart, sing your song for everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma, I'm tired.
LEADMALE:We've been rehearsing all day.
OTHERMALE:But if we don't rehearse, we don't win.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, aren't you getting a little carried away with this pageant? Well, don't be ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, I wish Janet were here to see how wonderful her mother and her little girl are getting along.
SUPFEMALE:I just know she's gonna let her come back year after year.
SUPFEMALE:I'll go get the music.
LEADFEMALE:You be sure and get some sleep tonight, sweetheart, so you'll be all rested when we go to the zoo tomorrow.
LEADMALE:I'm not going to the zoo.
OTHERFEMALE:Grandma says we have to rehearse tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, we can't do anything fun because of the stupid pageant.
LEADMALE:I wish I could just go home.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
OTHERFEMALE:But before we sing our little hearts out, how about a hug for the best grandma in the world?  I hate this.
OTHERFEMALE:I am not good at firing people.
LEADFEMALE:I've never been good at confrontations.
LEADMALE:How about when you made that cop cry? Then he wasn't much of a cop, was he? Maybe I better talk to Nurse DeFarge.
SUPFEMALE:I think I could handle it with a little more tact.
LEADMALE:Ah, good morning, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:Not for you, Nursey-nurse-nurse-nurse.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, what I think Rose is trying to say is that Uh, things aren't working out, and we're gonna have to let you go.
OTHERFEMALE:You're firing me? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? I've been fired, Ma.
LEADMALE:What? We all think it's for the best.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Mildred, I guess that's it.
SUPFEMALE:What Dorothy says, goes.
OTHERMALE:We'll just have to say  Leg cramp.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! There, there, there.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that's better.
LEADMALE:Thank God you were here.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I cannot leave.
LEADMALE:What? Until she can walk again, I'm staying put.
LEADMALE:You're a good daughter.
SUPFEMALE:Take a lesson, pussycat.
OTHERFEMALE:You're pussycat, too? I am pussycat one.
SUPMALE:You are pussycat two.
LEADFEMALE:What can I do? Ma obviously needs her.
LEADMALE:My hands are tied.
SUPMALE:Sorry about that nursey-nurse-nurse-nurse thing.
LEADMALE:I never thought I'd see you again.
LEADMALE:Well, Sophia, I'm going to have to keep my word.
LEADMALE:As soon as you can walk, I'll have to leave.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I know, as soon as I can walk.
LEADMALE:But I don't think that's gonna be for a long, long time.
LEADFEMALE:This competition's gonna be a piece of cake, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Just look around.
SUPMALE:Ugly.
SUPFEMALE:No charisma.
SUPFEMALE:Now there's a gym teacher waiting to happen.
LEADMALE:Blanche, how can you say that? All these girls are adorable.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, sure.
SUPMALE:I just wish I had that one's nose full of nickels.
SUPFEMALE:She's on in two minutes.
LEADMALE:Oh, two minutes.
LEADMALE:Grandma, I don't think I can sing in front of all those people out there.
LEADMALE:But of course you can, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:You're just a little nervous.
LEADMALE:They always get this way before the talent portion.
LEADFEMALE:My Clarisse still gets butterflies before she twirls her fire batons.
SUPFEMALE:Fire scares me.
LEADFEMALE:But I just remind her that Mommy is right off stage with a big bucket of baking soda, and then she feels better.
LEADFEMALE:It scares me a lot.
OTHERMALE:Well, anyway, good luck to you both.
SUPMALE:Come along, Clarisse.
OTHERFEMALE:Help me.
LEADMALE:Did you see that? I tell you, some people should not be allowed near children.
LEADMALE:That poor little girl.
LEADFEMALE:What could be worse than havin' a mother like that? Having a grandmother like that.
SUPFEMALE:Now, wait a minute, Rose.
OTHERMALE:I'm just doin' this for Melissa.
OTHERMALE:She's been havin' a wonderful time.
SUPFEMALE:Has she? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Meli-Melissa, come here.
LEADFEMALE:Sweetheart, come here, I want to ask you somethin'.
LEADFEMALE:Now, tell me the truth.
OTHERMALE:You want to be here, don't you? You've been havin' a wonderful time with Grandma, haven't you? 'Cause if you haven't been, darlin', well, we'll just leave right now.
SUPMALE:She's on! Showtime!  She's not singin'.
SUPMALE:Why? Why ain't she singin'? Well, she's just frozen solid.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Melissa? Oh, gosh, Melissa! That's your music, Melissa.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, do you remember the words? Gray skies are gonna clear up Put on a happy face Come on, sweetheart, sing.
LEADMALE:Brush off the clouds and cheer up Go down the stairs.
SUPFEMALE:Here's where you move your feet.
SUPMALE:Move! Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy It's not your She was so good at home.
LEADMALE:You'll look so good that you'll be glad you decided to smile Smile.
SUPMALE:Pick out a pleasant outlook Stick out that noble chin Stick it out.
OTHERFEMALE:If you sing, I'll buy you a puppy.
LEADFEMALE:Slap on a happy grin And spread sunshine all Oh, let me have that boa.
LEADMALE:Just put on a happy Put on a happy Her daddy's still in the Gulf.
LEADFEMALE:Put on a happy Melissa? Face  Oh.
LEADMALE:Uh, Melissa, may I speak with you, please? Could you wait a moment? Someone's having a story read to her.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:"And the prince took the princess to the castle, "and they lived happily ever after.
SUPMALE:The end.
LEADMALE:" They didn't get married? That's implied.
LEADMALE:For what it's worth, I, um I know it was a mistake to make you do the pageant and--and And I'm truly very sorry.
OTHERFEMALE: You know, your grandma feels real bad about everything.
LEADFEMALE:What do you say we forgive her? You know, you You remind me so much of your mother when she was your age.
SUPFEMALE:She used to get so mad at me.
OTHERMALE:And then as she got older, it seems like we just fought all the time.
LEADMALE:Till finally, one day, we just stopped talkin' altogether.
LEADMALE:It wasn't until you were born that we tried to make up, but seems like we still couldn't let go of the past.
LEADMALE:Oh, Melissa, I don't want to go through that again.
LEADFEMALE:I would just die if I thought that was gonna happen to us.
LEADMALE:Melissa, I know you're just a little girl, but this is the point where you're supposed to stop me and say, "I love you.
LEADMALE:Don't go.
LEADFEMALE:" Why? Well, because you're from the South, honey.
LEADFEMALE:It's just good manners.
SUPFEMALE:Course I still love you.
SUPFEMALE:You're my grandma.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just mad at you.
SUPMALE:Oh, well.
LEADMALE:I I can accept that, if you're still gonna give me another chance, 'cause I still want to try to be the best grandma in the whole world.
LEADFEMALE:Does this mean I can start calling you grandma again? Aw, of course you can.
SUPFEMALE:Just not around anybody in uniform.
OTHERMALE:Okay? Daisy, Daisy Give me your answer true I'm Hello.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:It's a miracle.
OTHERFEMALE:I can walk.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, look at you! You're walking.
OTHERMALE:I just can't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:Neither can I.
OTHERFEMALE:Pretty amazing, eh, pussycat? Mmm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations, Sophia.
LEADMALE:I am so proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:But I suppose this means that my work here is done.
SUPMALE:But don't you worry about me.
LEADFEMALE:As long as there's pain and suffering in the world, I'll be okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now that I'm up, I might as well do some shopping.
SUPMALE:Get back here, you deceitful little Sicilian gecko! I wuv you.
LEADFEMALE:Too wittle, too wate.
LEADMALE:Ma, I can't believe you did this.
LEADFEMALE:Why did you lie to me? Because, for the first time in my life, somebody was paying attention to me, pampering me, and it was nice.
OTHERFEMALE:Mildred made me feel special, feel loved.
LEADMALE:But what about the awful way she made the rest of us feel? Hey, that was just gravy.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Ma, I know I don't pamper you.
OTHERMALE:But the reason I make you do things for yourself, is because I want to keep you active and vital.
LEADFEMALE:The best way to show you I care is to make sure that you You don't settle into old age.
OTHERFEMALE:So you're saying you make me vacuum and dust and scrape crusty stuff off the tile because you love me? Honestly? It tickles me.
OTHERFEMALE:Pussycat.
OTHERMALE:Ma.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Morning, Rose, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:What a night.
LEADFEMALE:Did you hear that racket out front? I didn't sleep at all.
LEADFEMALE:I think Dreyfuss has the hots for our lawn flamingo.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, we don't have a lawn flamingo.
LEADMALE:In that case, we'd better tip the paperboy.
LEADMALE:What's with the photo albums? Oh, I'm doing a family history.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm gonna need your help.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I think it's important to tell the grandchildren about their ancestors.
SUPFEMALE:Give them a sense of pride in those who came before them.
LEADMALE:Even Uncle Nunzio? Even Uncle Nunzio, but we call the goat a pet.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, Ma, I want you to drag out anything that'll jog your memory about the old days.
LEADMALE:You know, people in St.
LEADMALE:Olaf are lucky.
OTHERFEMALE:We all had the same family tree.
LEADMALE:You can trace each of us back to the same brother and sister.
SUPMALE:Well, I think that completes the puzzle.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a second.
SUPFEMALE:Why are you asking me questions about our family? Uh-oh.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna die.
LEADMALE:You talked to my doctor.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna die.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, the doctor says you're healthy as a horse.
LEADMALE:Well, actually, the doctor in our pre-paid health plan says you're healthy as a camel.
OTHERFEMALE:I assume in his country it's the same as a horse.
LEADMALE:You know, Dorothy, for an extra $5, we can get a doctor who sees patients one at a time.
LEADFEMALE:Wonderful news.
SUPMALE:The contractor says he can start building the hot tub tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this is so exciting.
SUPMALE:So, Blanche, you must be paying extra to get a building permit that quickly.
LEADMALE:Hey, I'll tell you one thing, the damn government isn't gonna see one red cent of my money.
SUPFEMALE:But, Blanche, the city requires a permit on any new home construction built within five feet of a standing structure used as a primary dwelling.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, all this technical information, it doesn't sound like you.
SUPFEMALE:And if Blanche doesn't get that permit, I think they could make her live in a shoe.
SUPFEMALE:Welcome back, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:It all happened so fast.
LEADFEMALE:He grabbed her.
SUPMALE:She bit him.
LEADFEMALE:He stuffed her in his calamari wagon and sped away.
SUPFEMALE:And that, dear grandchildren, is how my parents met.
LEADFEMALE:How romantic, a roll in the squid.
LEADMALE:May I remind you, the purpose of these stories is to give the kids family pride.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I'll have you know it was my father who single-handedly invented the ransom note.
SUPMALE:If you're not gonna take this seriously, I'm just gonna do the history by myself.
LEADMALE:Hey, keep away from that.
SUPFEMALE:What are you What's in the box? Mexican jumping beans.
LEADMALE:Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, Hispanic jumping beans.
LEADFEMALE:You don't want me to know, fine.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't dream of infringing on your privacy.
SUPMALE:Look, Rudy Vallee! Where? Where? Dorothy, I'm gonna give you till the count of three to give me back that box.
OTHERMALE:One By the way, your reflexes are a joke.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, guess what I have under my robe? That guy from the circus? No, Dorothy, my new swimsuit.
LEADMALE:I'm wearing it to entice the muscular young men who are coming over to install my hot tub.
SUPMALE:Would you like to see it? Is it a two-piece? Yes.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this is just so exciting.
SUPFEMALE:I love construction workers.
LEADFEMALE:Good with their hands, dumb as stumps, and don't mind showing their buns when they bend over.
LEADMALE:Hey, look what I found.
SUPMALE:The box! Rose, where did you get it? Oh, I was just under my bed playing, and then there it was.
SUPMALE:Do you know whose it is? Oh, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Rose, how can I look at that face and lie? It's mine.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, I'm Don Benson.
SUPMALE:I'm here about the hot tub.
LEADMALE:Oh, my goodness, word does travel fast.
LEADMALE:It's not in yet, Don.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, I'm not here to soak in it.
SUPMALE:I'm a city inspector.
LEADMALE:You can't come in here.
LEADMALE:This house has been quarantined.
LEADFEMALE:We all have, uh Quick, Rose, give me a deadly disease.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have a deadly disease.
LEADMALE:Well, get one.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Well, we're off to a bad start.
LEADFEMALE:Won't you come in? May I help you? Yeah, I got a call from a Lois Nylund.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that's Rose Nylund.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, as in a series of seats in a movie theater.
LEADFEMALE:Or the flower? Well, yeah, that, too.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, can I see you in the kitchen? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you go in and find out? Get in there! Go, go! Excuse us.
LEADFEMALE:I ought to have you horsewhipped.
OTHERMALE:I haven't even opened the damn box! I'm-- I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I cannot believe you called the city after I specifically asked you not to.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I couldn't just sit there and be party to a lie.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Rose, come on.
SUPMALE:There're times it's all right to lie.
LEADMALE:Dorothy will back me up on this.
OTHERFEMALE:Right, Dorothy? No, it is not right to lie.
SUPFEMALE:Anybody got a bobby pin? Look, Rose, I have calculated the cost of this hot tub right down to the last penny.
LEADFEMALE:I cannot afford any useless permits.
LEADMALE:Now, if he insists I have to have them, it's gonna be on your head.
LEADFEMALE:Period! Well, I can't believe she said that.
LEADMALE:Exclamation point.
LEADFEMALE:Well, who's to say? Question mark, new paragraph What the hell am I saying? Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, this isn't my box, it's my mother's.
SUPFEMALE:I was gonna open it, but I can't.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, I'm proud of you.
SUPMALE:I can't with a bobby pin, maybe with a butter knife.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, you're off the hook.
LEADMALE:Don just made a quick, five-minute inspection and guess what? The permit's only $40.
OTHERFEMALE:You were right about tellin' the truth.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, if there's one thing I'm good at, it's citizenship.
LEADFEMALE:That and guessing the weight of brood sows.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it's just nice to know there's still people out there who don't think the city's out to get them.
LEADFEMALE:Somebody moving in? Oh, hardly.
LEADFEMALE:With the three of us renting from Blanche, we're practically sleeping on top of each other.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you can't do that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we all wear pajamas.
LEADFEMALE:No, I mean you can't rent to more than two people unless you have a boarding license.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, well, what the hey? Put it on my bill.
SUPFEMALE:What is it, another $40? Well, the permit's $80.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, that's not so bad.
LEADMALE:But the improvements you'll have to make will run you about $10,000.
SUPMALE:$10,000? I can't afford that.
OTHERFEMALE:Not even if I use up all my hot tub money.
SUPMALE:Well, I guess you'll just have to lose a renter.
LEADMALE:Hey, you got 48 hours.
LEADMALE:For Hey, uh, Don, wait! All right, I'm gonna catch him, but you're gonna sleep with him.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, you're not going to believe what I found in that box.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this photo.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's Sophia as a young bride.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but that's not my father.
SUPFEMALE:Ma was married to someone else before she married Pop, and she never told me.
OTHERMALE:I mean, she lied to me.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know this woman.
LEADMALE:I--I don't know my own mother.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, here you are, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:I still have a couple of questions about our family history, if that's okay.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:As long as you don't ask me about the box.
LEADFEMALE:The box? What box? Oh! It completely slipped my mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:That kind of thing happens to me all the All the All the shrimp you can eat.
LEADMALE:Nice try, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Let's talk about 1920.
LEADFEMALE:Bad year.
LEADFEMALE:Now, 1918 I said 1920.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, 1920 it is.
SUPFEMALE:The year I sailed for America.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, America.
SUPFEMALE:The land of opportunity, where the streets were paved with gold, and a young man named Irving Berlin was writing songs like this.
LEADFEMALE:Hit it.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, where's our piano player? Ma, get back on the track.
LEADFEMALE:Did you date much? Not really.
LEADFEMALE:Then what about this picture of you in a wedding gown with someone who is identified as Guido? Oh, World's Fair, at the "Have your picture taken with a Guido" booth.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, you were married to somebody else.
LEADFEMALE:I have a right to know about it.
SUPMALE:Wrong.
SUPFEMALE:There are some things a daughter should not know about her mother.
LEADMALE:You're always sticking your nose in where it doesn't belong.
OTHERMALE:Just like that old dog Sandy we used to have.
LEADMALE:God, your father loved that dog.
OTHERMALE:Can you believe that? After I've bared my heart and soul to that woman.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, you hide things from her all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but she doesn't know that.
LEADMALE:I am the smartest woman in the whole world.
LEADMALE:And I am the Pygmy queen.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Blanche, what would you say if I got a permit that would let you have as many people stay here as you want? What? Oh, that's terrific.
LEADMALE:Rose, this says I'm going to turn my home into a halfway house for recently released criminals.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, Rose, you are the smartest person in the world.
LEADFEMALE:Burger World.
LEADMALE:Rose, if I use this permit, any kind of scum could walk through the door.
SUPMALE:Thieves, murderers, men who haven't seen a woman for 10 years, who've been doin' nothin' but liftin' weights and countin' the days.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, remind me again why this was a bad idea.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Blanche, be serious.
LEADMALE:Now, if we want to stay together, we're gonna have to raise $10,000.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't see why I should have to raise any money.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't create this problem.
SUPFEMALE:I think the moronic Scandinavian nitwit ought to pay it.
LEADFEMALE:She's talking about me, isn't she? No, Rose, she's talking about Spike Lee.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't get smart with me, Dorothy, just because you're out $10,000.
SUPFEMALE:Me? Well, face facts.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, we were already roommates when you brought your mother in.
LEADMALE:So either pay up, or Sophia should move out.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you very much, but if anybody is going to put my mother out in the cold, it's going to be me.
OTHERMALE:No, Rose, forget it.
LEADFEMALE:She did sort of just dump the old lady on us, didn't she? Oh, now you're buddy-buddy with the moronic Scandinavian nitwit? Jealous, are we? Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:I try to come up with a solution, the two of you don't even try to help.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Just count me out of this.
LEADMALE:Well, fine.
SUPMALE:Just count me out of it.
LEADMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:But it's your funeral.
LEADFEMALE:Nice try, Dorothy, but she'd probably need a permit for that, too.
LEADMALE:Oh, here you are.
LEADMALE:All right, Rose, I have something to say to you now, and I want you to pay attention.
SUPFEMALE:Listen to me, honey Oh, Blanche, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, I'm sorry, too.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, but I'm really sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, girls, I am so sorry.
OTHERMALE:No, we're the ones that are sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Oh, sweetie, get over here.
OTHERMALE:We're sorry, too.
LEADMALE:Yes, we are.
SUPFEMALE:We're really sorry.
SUPMALE:It's our fault, too.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, how were you supposed to know I had an accident in the hall.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, why were you guys sorry? Oh, well, this isn't solving anything.
LEADMALE:This whole thing was my fault.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna be responsible.
LEADMALE:I'll move out.
LEADMALE:Rose, you are not going to move out.
LEADMALE:Well, somebody has to.
SUPMALE:How else are we gonna choose? We could do what they do in Russia.
LEADMALE:We could vote.
LEADFEMALE:Here, it's the only fair way.
LEADMALE:I would just like the panel to disregard that accident-in-the-hall thing.
OTHERMALE:All right, everybody, just write down who you think ought to leave.
SUPMALE:Well, you know this is a waste of time.
LEADMALE:I'm just gonna write down myself.
LEADMALE:Don't tell us that.
LEADMALE:Yeah, maybe we should do this.
OTHERMALE:It's the fairest way.
LEADMALE:All right, but it's just gonna end up being me.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Here we go.
OTHERMALE:Good luck, ladies.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:Well, that's that.
SUPMALE:Let's eat.
SUPFEMALE:I'm starved.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:How did this happen? We all voted for you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Dorothy, it's your own damn fault.
SUPMALE:Why did you have to vote for yourself? I just assumed that everyone was gonna vote for Rose, and I--I didn't want a sweep to hurt her feelings.
SUPFEMALE:I guess that would hurt.
LEADMALE:It does! Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:No, wait, I cannot allow this to happen.
SUPFEMALE:Now, this whole thing was my fault.
SUPMALE:I am the one who must go.
LEADMALE:No! Nobody is gonna go anywhere.
LEADMALE:Now, there's gotta be another way.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what choice do we have? I mean Oh, I'll miss you, and you know I love you.
SUPMALE:But it's the only way.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just have to find some other place to rent.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, would you stop saying that.
LEADMALE:Hey, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:The city says you can't have three renters, but what if What if we're all co-owners? Co-owners? Yeah.
LEADMALE:You sell us each a share of the house and we pay you every month, like we always have, but instead of paying rent, we'll be paying the mortgage.
SUPMALE:I tell you what.
LEADMALE:Why don't we just forget all about the mortgage, and I'll just give you all the house as a present? Yeah! Then I'll just buy all your clothes, pay for all your food, set up trust funds for all your grandchildren.
SUPMALE:Throw in a piano player, you got yourself a deal.
LEADFEMALE:Like hell! This is my home we're talking about here.
SUPFEMALE:And it's more than a home.
OTHERMALE:It's memories.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, this is where I lived with my husband.
LEADFEMALE:It's-- It's my past, and it's my future.
LEADMALE:As I move on towards middle age, it's all I have.
LEADMALE:You're right, Blanche, it's a lot to ask.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, but it really is.
OTHERMALE:I just could never sell it.
SUPFEMALE:Not even to you all.
OTHERFEMALE:I know what you're gonna say, Dorothy, you can't stand to see me go.
LEADFEMALE:But I've made up my mind.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, listen Now you're going to tell me, "I'll miss you.
SUPMALE:God, how I'll miss you.
LEADFEMALE:" Rose, you have to listen to me.
SUPFEMALE:"You know, Rosie," you're thinking.
LEADFEMALE:"I sure could use one last St.
SUPMALE:Olaf story before you leave.
LEADMALE:" And then I'd ask, "Shall I tell you about how the St.
OTHERMALE:Olafians "were one of the original lost tribes of Israel?" Taxi! I knew you were gonna say that.
LEADMALE:Look, Rose, sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you are not going to leave.
LEADMALE:Rose, we need you here.
LEADFEMALE:Really.
LEADMALE:You're too important here! Okay, that's not believable.
LEADMALE:We love you.
LEADFEMALE:So, who's leaving? Oh, we were just discussing that, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Benson.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid that no one's leaving.
SUPFEMALE:You see, we're a family here.
SUPFEMALE:Well, not the conventional one, but we love each other and Excuse me, snoop.
SUPMALE:Liar.
LEADMALE:Rhino.
OTHERMALE:Lizard.
LEADMALE:It's real love, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Benson.
LEADFEMALE:It's an honest love.
LEADMALE:And, yes, we might have secrets that we stubbornly try to hide from each other Python.
LEADMALE:Swamp insect.
LEADMALE:But we're a family nonetheless, and you can't break us up.
SUPMALE:Well, as moving as all this is, I can't help you.
LEADMALE:I gotta file my report, and either Mrs.
LEADMALE:Devereaux has to bring the house up to code, or somebody's gotta leave.
LEADFEMALE:Wait just a minute.
LEADFEMALE:These women no longer live in my house.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, what are you saying? I'm saying that it's not just my house anymore.
LEADMALE:It's our house.
LEADMALE:I've decided to share the title with you.
LEADFEMALE:We'll sign the deed tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:That way you'll have equity and nobody can make you leave.
LEADFEMALE:By golly, you got me.
LEADMALE:Say, Don, why don't you drop back by after the hot tub's in.
OTHERMALE:Ooh.
OTHERMALE:Land.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a landowner.
LEADFEMALE:I've made it.
OTHERMALE:And it only took 80 years.
LEADMALE:Finally, property.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be planting soon.
LEADMALE:Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, this was so generous of you.
OTHERMALE:I'm so touched.
SUPMALE:Well, you know, I just got to thinkin'.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, this house was the home of my family.
LEADMALE:But you're right, you're family now.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:So, now it's our home.
LEADFEMALE:Rabbits.
LEADMALE:Gonna raise me some rabbits as big as your head.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, we have to talk.
SUPMALE:I think it's time we settled this.
LEADMALE:Get off my property.
LEADMALE:Ma, that's enough.
LEADMALE:Now, look, Ma, this isn't our relationship.
LEADFEMALE:Not talking to each other.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, I'm sure you had your reasons, but it can't have felt good hiding this man from me all these years.
SUPMALE:Well, no.
LEADFEMALE:Then unburden yourself, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Not just to your daughter, but to your friend.
LEADMALE:Here goes.
SUPFEMALE:The man you saw in that picture was Guido Spirelli.
LEADFEMALE:He was my first husband through an arranged marriage, which I had later annulled.
LEADMALE:And? And I shot him just to watch him die.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean, "And?" I mean, that's all? That's all you're gonna tell me about it? We were promised to each other when we were nine.
LEADFEMALE:By most Sicilian standards, he was considered quite a catch.
LEADMALE:And he was supposed to inherit the family business.
LEADMALE:Oh, what was the family business? Getting even.
SUPMALE:So, what was the problem? What, you didn't love him? No, he was a workaholic.
LEADMALE:I had the marriage annulled, and two days after it was official, I left for America.
LEADMALE:Ma, why couldn't you tell me this? Dorothy, I went against centuries of tradition.
LEADMALE:You don't leave an arranged marriage.
LEADMALE:I disgraced my family's entire way of life.
LEADMALE:I think I'm finally beginning to see.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Then you'll have the decency to lie if anyone asks you about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course not, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:It all has to go in the family history.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't do this, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Don't do something we'll both regret.
SUPFEMALE:I have to, Ma.
SUPMALE:In 1920, your great-grandmother, Sophia Petrillo, became a pioneer in the women's rights movement.
OTHERFEMALE:She single-handedly dragged her family into the 20th century by refusing to be thought of as property and demanding instead to marry a man she loved.
OTHERFEMALE:To do so, she had to leave behind everything she'd ever known.
SUPMALE:And that is the kind of courage and strength that flows through your veins.
OTHERFEMALE:Pussycat? Yeah, Ma? You make me very proud.
LEADFEMALE:No, Ma, you make me proud.
LEADMALE:I hope you're not waiting for a hug.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come here, you tramp.
SUPMALE:
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, it's past your bedtime.
LEADMALE:Ma, I'm 60 years old.
LEADFEMALE:I can stay up as late as I want.
LEADFEMALE:No, we said when you're 65 you can stay up as late as you want.
LEADFEMALE:Now, what are you doing? Well, if you must know, I'm writing a letter to Pop.
LEADMALE:The same Pop who died 17 years ago? That's right.
LEADMALE:There's nothing sadder than your daughter losing it before you do.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Ma, I'm not gonna mail it.
SUPFEMALE:I just read somewhere that you can settle your feelings about someone even after they're gone, and there were a lot of things I never told Pop while he was alive.
SUPMALE:I never even got to say goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:So, I'm getting all this stored-up emotion out in a letter.
SUPFEMALE:Good idea, pussycat.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna write one to Mario Lanza.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I would like you all to meet Stevie.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna be coachin' him.
LEADMALE:He's a professional baseball player.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you got Blanche's number from the wall in the dugout? Yes, ma'am.
SUPFEMALE:And it sure was right.
LEADFEMALE:I am having a good time.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you, Stevie.
LEADFEMALE:Now, here's the vitamins.
LEADFEMALE:Take them when you get up.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, but sometimes I get up at 4:00 a.
LEADMALE:m.
OTHERFEMALE:to Well, you know.
OTHERMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, do I know.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but I'm sure afterwards Stevie doesn't yell, "Help! Come get me.
SUPMALE:My feet are asleep.
OTHERMALE:" You better be gettin' to bed, darlin', you're in trainin'.
OTHERMALE:Oh, wait a minute, almost forgot.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to put this lingerie on under your uniform for battin' practice.
LEADFEMALE:I know you said you'd help my game, but do you think this will work? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:I can't wear this.
SUPMALE:Do you have any idea the kind of teasing that goes on in a locker room? Yes.
SUPMALE:Now, look, you have to discover the sensuality of baseball.
SUPMALE:There're just many, many, many similarities between baseball and makin' love.
OTHERFEMALE:The mental preparation, the rush of adrenalin, the unspecified duration of the game.
SUPFEMALE:And you should hear the cheers coming from Blanche's room on Old-Timers' Day.
OTHERFEMALE:It's nice meeting you.
SUPFEMALE:See you tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Now, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:You're a coaching a baseball player by letting him wear your underwear? Didn't I see this movie? A woman helps a handsome ballplayer and he goes off to live with the Indians.
LEADMALE:What was it called? Dances with Bulls?  Ma, you're confusing Bull Durham with Dances with Wolves.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, what's the difference? You get to see Kevin Costner's buns in both of them.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe I can't teach Stevie anything about the game, but I can encourage him and give him a shot of self-esteem.
LEADFEMALE:Some people are great artists, some are great musicians.
OTHERMALE:I have but one talent.
LEADMALE:Oh! Oh! I know.
SUPMALE:Come on, Ma, too easy.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I was gonna say.
OTHERFEMALE:My talent is molding men.
SUPMALE:And I'm not doin' this just for myself, I'm doin' it for baseball.
LEADMALE:For the fans.
LEADFEMALE:The community expects somethin' of me.
SUPMALE:Oh! Oh! I know! Oh, thanks for a wonderful evening.
LEADMALE:It's not many men who'll take a girl shopping.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's not every woman who likes to shop for bait.
SUPFEMALE:Well, sweetheart, I had a wonderful time.
OTHERMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait minute.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:What's this in my pocket? That line didn't work last night, and it's not gonna work tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Ta-da! Come on, put it on.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, it's beautiful.
LEADMALE:The stone goes on top, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it is beautiful! But before I wear this, Miles, I have to know what it means.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's a friendship ring, like Abbott might have given to Costello.
SUPMALE:I love it.
LEADMALE:So, now we're a dead comedy team? What? It's that sense of humor.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that's why I buy you jewelry.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, good buddy.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, Rose.
LEADMALE:It's more than just a friendship ring.
LEADFEMALE:It's It's just that I want my ring on my girl.
LEADFEMALE:Are you saying what I think you're saying? What do you think I'm saying? Well, I think you're saying, you want your ring on your girl.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Hi, everyone.
LEADFEMALE:If I seem a little giddy, it's because Look what Miles gave me.
LEADFEMALE:Liver spots? No, the ring.
LEADMALE:You know what it is? Well, it's not an engagement ring, but it's more than a friendship ring.
LEADMALE:It's a It's a Isn't it pretty? Much nicer than Abbott would have given to Costello.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, the light bulb goes on every time.
SUPFEMALE:Doesn't mean someone's living there.
LEADMALE:It's Charlie.
SUPMALE:It's Charlie.
LEADMALE:He's trying to contact me from beyond the grave.
SUPFEMALE:It's a miracle! Look closely, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:It's Mrs.
SUPMALE:Butterworth's.
SUPFEMALE:I think you'd better sit down.
OTHERFEMALE:Before he died, Charlie and I agreed that if he ever wanted to tell me something from the other side, we'd have a signal.
LEADMALE:All the cantaloupe would be on one side of the fruit salad.
SUPFEMALE:See, Charlie liked to eat each type of fruit separately.
LEADFEMALE:He hated it when they were all mixed together.
LEADMALE:Then why did you make fruit salad? That was an argument we must have had about a million times.
LEADFEMALE:But he hated cantaloupe.
LEADFEMALE:He said he'd rather be dead than eat cantaloupe.
OTHERMALE:Hence, the signal.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, it's a miracle.
LEADFEMALE:But why would he try to contact me now? Oh, my God, it's the ring that Miles gave me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Charlie doesn't want me belonging to another man.
SUPMALE:Blanche, just out of curiosity, why don't you check the fruit salad? No way.
LEADMALE:I'm not goin' anywhere near that refrigerator.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, two miracles in one day.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, girls, I couldn't get to sleep.
LEADMALE:I just had to see it once more.
LEADFEMALE:Where's my cantaloupe? Where's my miracle? I'm an old lady.
SUPFEMALE:I need fruit.
OTHERMALE:Ah, girls, what a great night.
LEADFEMALE:Stevie went three for four.
SUPMALE:Oh, you were at the game? There was a game? That man just makes me feel so young.
LEADMALE:Like I was back in high school again.
LEADMALE:Remember? Remember how you used to feel when your boyfriend was star of the football team? Oh, look who I'm talkin' to! My Dorothy knew the star of the football team very well.
LEADMALE:In fact, she was the head cheerleader.
LEADFEMALE:Head cheerleader, listen to me.
LEADFEMALE:She was the mascot.
LEADFEMALE:They put her in a bear suit with pom-poms.
SUPFEMALE:Do the growl, pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, do the growl.
LEADFEMALE:Ma.
OTHERMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:No, it so happens I was their good luck charm.
OTHERFEMALE:They won a lot of games with me in that suit.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, the other team was always afraid we'd send in the bear.
LEADMALE:God, you gave me a lot of laughs.
LEADMALE:Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, stop it.
LEADFEMALE:Stop it.
LEADMALE:Well, then you know what I mean about bein' around athletes.
SUPMALE:It's fun.
LEADMALE:And you know what they call them? Jocks.
SUPMALE:Isn't that simply delicious? Blanche, I don't think this is gonna work.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, you don't know anything about baseball.
SUPFEMALE:You're just misleading this guy.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you're just jealous because I have a healthy sex life and all you have is your mother.
SUPMALE:Dorothy would rather have me than a healthy sex life.
SUPMALE:Right, Dorothy? Right.
LEADFEMALE:Not! That's how you talk to your mother? Put that in the letter to your father.
LEADFEMALE:How sassy you've gotten since menopause.
LEADMALE:You haven't mailed that letter to your father yet? Once more, I am not going to mail it.
OTHERMALE:I am just writing this to get the anger out of my system.
SUPMALE:You know, I know Pop loved me, but why did he always make promises to me that he never kept? Do you know how that affects a little girl? Like the time he promised me he was gonna take me to his work and introduce me to his boss and show me around to all his friends.
LEADMALE:When he didn't, well, I just I felt like there was something wrong with me, like Like he wasn't proud of me.
LEADMALE:He was proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:I remember him saying, "Anyone would want a daughter like this.
SUPFEMALE:" Of course, he was saying it to the gypsies.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I don't have to listen to this.
OTHERFEMALE:Have you any idea how it makes me feel when you say things like that? No.
LEADMALE:After I'm dead, drop me a note.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, Charlie must really be upset about me accepting Miles' ring.
OTHERMALE:Oh, God, if I could just talk to him one more time.
LEADFEMALE:I would give every last cent I have.
LEADMALE:Wait, Rose.
SUPMALE:What, Sophia? It's not Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:It's Charlie.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in the old lady's body.
SUPMALE:Come on, Sophia, you're full of Fruit salad.
SUPMALE:Charlie? Charlie, I want to believe it's you.
LEADMALE:Tell me something that only the two of us would know.
LEADFEMALE:Don't take any wooden nickels.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God, it is you! Why have you come back now? To tell you to open your heart and your pocketbook.
OTHERFEMALE:Give the old lady money.
SUPMALE:Make it a $20.
LEADMALE:I will, but there's something I have to know.
LEADMALE:How do you feel about the ring Miles gave me? Uh, how do you think I feel? You must be pretty upset about it to come back from the beyond.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, that works.
SUPFEMALE:I have to go, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye, my love.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? Why am I standing? When can I get that $20? Sophia, the most amazing thing happened.
SUPMALE:Charlie was here, in your body.
LEADFEMALE:Really? If I had known he was coming, I would have tidied up a bit.
OTHERFEMALE:Miles? It's me.
SUPMALE:Miles, this isn't easy.
SUPMALE:I I I've come to a decision.
OTHERMALE:I can't keep the ring.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Rose, Miles called earlier.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he must have gotten the ring.
OTHERMALE:I sent it back.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, what happened? You were so happy about him yesterday.
LEADMALE:But that was before I talked to Charlie.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about? Well, I heard Charlie's voice coming out of Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:He wanted me to give the ring back.
LEADFEMALE:You're a horrible little person.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, like you never pretended to be possessed by somebody's dead husband for a couple of laughs.
LEADMALE:You know, you have really ruined Rose's relationship with Miles.
LEADMALE:If you could have seen her face when I talked like Charlie.
LEADFEMALE:I almost wet myself.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, you vindictive little sea monkey, you are going to tell Rose the truth.
LEADMALE:Or? Remember Shady Pines? Yeah, it wasn't so bad.
SUPFEMALE:I hear they sold it to some Germans.
LEADMALE:Rose? Rose, sweetheart? Rose?  You're getting better all the time.
OTHERMALE:You know, with those two hits in last night's game, your battin' average is up over .
LEADFEMALE:300 now.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but on that last swing, I I think I tore my camisole.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why don't we head for the showers? You wash and I'll dry.
OTHERMALE:Well, that might be a problem.
SUPFEMALE:See, Blanche, there's something I gotta tell you.
SUPFEMALE:But first I want you to know, you've changed my life.
LEADMALE:And no matter where I am, I'll never forget you.
LEADMALE:Why does this sound like a goodbye speech? Well, I'm leaving for Japan.
LEADMALE:A team there made me an offer.
LEADMALE:Made you an offer? Well, what about us? Blanche, this is the way baseball works.
SUPMALE:It's time for me to move on.
LEADFEMALE:But we make such a great team.
LEADMALE:We've had some good times, but I gotta do this.
SUPMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:You gotta move on? Move on.
LEADMALE:But let me tell you somethin', mister, I haven't taught you half of what I know.
LEADFEMALE:And I wasn't even wearin' underwear.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I hate men.
SUPFEMALE:Stevie's leavin' me.
LEADMALE:For another woman? Oh, don't be ridiculous.
SUPMALE:He's leaving me for Tokyo.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:What's going on? Oh, Stevie's leaving Blanche for Tokyo, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I can understand that.
LEADFEMALE:She is a big radio personality.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I would stay and talk I have a lot of big problems of my own.
SUPFEMALE:I'd share them with you, but I don't want to bore you.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, Rose is going through a very hard time.
OTHERMALE:But I think there's something that's gonna make her feel much better.
LEADMALE:Ma, don't you have something to say? Yeah.
LEADMALE:How come when your head moves, your hair doesn't? Ma, that's a question.
SUPFEMALE:Granted, a very good question, but we're looking for a statement.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Charlie wasn't here.
LEADMALE:It was me.
LEADFEMALE:I was playing a little joke on you.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:One second, Charlie.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean it wasn't you, Sophia? Rose, Ma was playing a very mean trick on you.
LEADFEMALE:Although now I can see the temptation.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, Rose, it was a bad joke, and I didn't realize what it was doing to you.
SUPFEMALE:Bad joke? It wasn't a joke at all.
LEADFEMALE:You mocked my relationship with Charlie, and you've ruined my friendship with Miles.
LEADFEMALE:How can you be so cruel? Rose, we have to talk.
SUPMALE:Forget it, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not talking to you.
LEADFEMALE:What you did is the worst thing you've ever done to me.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Worse than the time I buried you up to your neck in sand and let the children throw baseballs at you for 25 cents? Well, I can't hold that against you.
SUPFEMALE:That was for charity.
LEADMALE:Yeah, right, charity.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it, Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:Impersonating Charlie was horrible.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I made a mistake.
OTHERMALE:But not as big as the one you'll make if you don't get back with Miles.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Charlie loved you for over 30 years.
OTHERFEMALE:But he's gone now, and you've met someone you really care about.
LEADMALE:What do you think Charlie would say? I think he'd say he loves me.
SUPFEMALE:And what about the ring? He'd probably say it was okay to wear Miles' ring because Miles can love me in a way that he can't right now.
SUPFEMALE:There you go, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:That must be Miles.
SUPMALE:I told him to come over so I could explain.
LEADMALE:You, uh, said you wanted to see me? Yes, Miles.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused.
LEADMALE:Although I love you very much, I--I was scared of commitment.
SUPMALE:I guess, in a way, I--I wanted to believe that Charlie was trying to contact me.
LEADMALE:Oh, sweetheart, there's nothing to be scared of.
LEADMALE:When you're ready to wear the ring, you know it's right here in my pocket.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm ready to wear the ring.
LEADMALE:It's right here in my pocket.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Rose, it's right here in my pocket Oh, Sophia! Uh   Hey, I didn't see her sitting there.
LEADMALE:Oh, Miles.
SUPMALE:Get it while you're young, baby.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Rose, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:I've got a great idea.
OTHERFEMALE:You ever watch that romantic cruise that leaves at 6:00 p.
LEADMALE:m.
SUPMALE:from the pier? Oh, Miles! Let's go watch it again.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I finally finished my letter.
SUPMALE:I got everything down, every little hurt out.
LEADMALE:This is to me.
LEADMALE:I found out during the process that Pop was a pretty good father.
SUPFEMALE:But I never really told him I loved him, so I want to make sure I tell you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, pussycat.
SUPFEMALE:"Dear Ma.
LEADFEMALE:"Thanks for giving me life and thanks for making it good.
LEADMALE:"I love you.
LEADMALE:" And I love you, too, pussycat.
LEADMALE:And I love you, too.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm glad you're my mom.
SUPFEMALE:And I'm glad you're my baby.
LEADMALE:That's probably the schmaltz police.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE: This is too funny.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche! Stevie? What happened to you? Blanche, honey, what's happened to me is the most wonderful thing that could happen to a man, and it's all because of you.
LEADFEMALE:For the first time in my life, I'm batting .
LEADFEMALE:310, and I like myself.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, you really know how to mold a man.
SUPFEMALE:He comes in Steve and goes out Eydie.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I thought about what you were saying, and going to Japan is not worth losing you.
LEADFEMALE:You and me, Blanche, we are a team.
SUPFEMALE:This is too funny.
SUPMALE:I don't have to leave the country.
LEADMALE:With you coaching me, I can make the big leagues right here.
LEADFEMALE:And we'll still have each other.
LEADMALE:What do you say we go out and celebrate, huh? I'm sorry, Stevie, but I cannot go out with you tonight.
LEADFEMALE:It's the dress, isn't it? It's not the dress.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you were ready to write me off yesterday.
OTHERFEMALE:Now coming back here cannot take away all the pain and hurt that I felt.
SUPMALE:No, I cannot forgive you.
SUPFEMALE:I Goodbye, Stevie.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait! It was the dress.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma, I'm making dinner.
LEADMALE:What would you like to eat? A nice thick T-bone steak, corn on the cob, and pecan pie for dessert.
LEADMALE:Now ask me what I can chew.
LEADMALE:I'll start soaking the cornflakes now.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, you will never guess who was just on the phone! The real phone, Rose, or your Farmer in the Dell phone? Oh, please.
SUPMALE:I haven't had a Farmer in the Dell phone since I was 50.
SUPMALE:Now, who called, Rose? Jerry Kennedy! Jerry Kennedy, the newscaster? Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:He's coming over to pick up his daily planner.
SUPFEMALE:I took it home from work by mistake.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, was I embarrassed when I showed up for handball with Walter Cronkite.
OTHERMALE:By the way, if you ever run into Walt, don't tell him he looks like Captain Kangaroo.
OTHERFEMALE:Miami's most glamorous anchorman is comin' here? Oh, I'm gonna go freshen up.
LEADFEMALE:If his bottom half is as good as his top half, I'm in love.
SUPMALE:Boy, the timing of Jerry's visit works out perfectly for me.
SUPMALE:See, his birthday is in two weeks, and the office is giving him a surprise roast.
LEADMALE:So I have to come up with one or two things that I can kid him about.
LEADMALE:I can get away with it 'cause he considers me a good friend.
SUPMALE:Well, then why not tease him about his taste in friends?  Oh, that must be Jerry now.
SUPMALE:Now, remember the roast.
SUPFEMALE:I really wanna nail him.
LEADFEMALE:So keep your eyes peeled for any oddities or quirks.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:It's me, Stan.
LEADMALE:There's one.
LEADFEMALE:What do I win? Stanley, what do you want? Dorothy, I know you're still mad at me for spoiling our wedding, but I've got some news.
LEADFEMALE:Big news.
LEADMALE:And I thought you might wanna hear about it.
LEADFEMALE:You've misjudged me.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, I'm seeing a psychiatrist.
OTHERMALE:I've discovered that the old Stan really wasn't Stan.
SUPMALE:He was merely a Stan trying to be the Stan that everyone thought Stan should be.
SUPMALE:Hey, I've been there.
LEADMALE:But now, with a little bit of help, I'm becoming a new Stan.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, great.
OTHERMALE:I'll take a People magazine and a Morning Herald.
LEADMALE:Ma, he is not a newsstand.
LEADMALE:He's a new Stan.
SUPFEMALE:Then you can see the change? I'm waiting for the change.
SUPMALE:That was a $5 I handed you.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Stan, old Stan, new Stan, tastes-great-less-filling Stan.
LEADMALE:The point is, I am not interested.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck in therapy.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, I don't think you quite get it I get it perfectly.
OTHERMALE:You're going to therapy to try to win me back.
SUPMALE:And I'm telling you, you're wasting your time.
LEADMALE:Not to mention $100 an hour.
LEADFEMALE:$110, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:This guy's got the little beard and everything.
LEADFEMALE:Dr.
SUPMALE:Halperin's working with me on something called "closure.
LEADMALE:" I'm not going there to try to win you back.
SUPMALE:I'm going there to try to get over you.
OTHERMALE:Go around her, it takes less time.
SUPMALE:The doctor feels that if you would maybe join me at a session or two, I might be able to work through my attachment that much sooner.
LEADFEMALE:What do you say, babe? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I'd I'd have to give it some thought.
LEADMALE:Jerry, hello! Hello, Rose.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry about all this.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, sorry? There's no need to be sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm a man who acknowledged he had a problem, and I'm seeing somebody about it.
LEADFEMALE:Now Goodbye, Stan.
LEADFEMALE:He's our mailman.
LEADMALE:We've just allowed him to get a little too close.
OTHERMALE:Jerry, I'd like you to meet my friends, Dorothy How do you do? How do you do? and her mother, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you recognize our guest? Of course I do.
LEADFEMALE:The only man you've had in your bedroom after 11:00 since we moved here.
LEADFEMALE:Jer, I'll get your planner.
LEADMALE:Watch this, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:He won't even know I'm fishing for info.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Jerry, uh, when I was a little girl, my father misplaced his daily planner, too.
SUPMALE:It was when we were on the way to the state fair.
SUPFEMALE:Speaking of state fairs, is it true that you're cheap? Oh, my goodness.
SUPMALE:We have company.
SUPMALE:Just so embarrassed to be seen in this old thing.
SUPMALE:Don't worry, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:The dress covers most of it.
LEADFEMALE:Jerry, I'd like you to meet my roommate, Blanche Devereaux.
LEADFEMALE:And, Blanche, this is Oh, why, you don't have to tell me.
SUPFEMALE:"From the Gulf coast to the Atlantic, "from the Keys to the Okeefenokee, "with the 11:00 news, this is Jerry Kennedy.
LEADMALE:" Well, I'm flattered.
SUPFEMALE:From the pit of my stomach to the porcelain of the bowl There isn't an evenin' I miss one of your broadcasts, Jerry.
LEADMALE:I just loved that in-depth location piece you did on the homeless.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thank you very much.
OTHERFEMALE:My agent said if I hadn't referred to them as bums, I would have won a Peabody.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:So, Jer, uh, ever dress up like a horse? Well, not so far, but I thank you for asking.
SUPFEMALE:Now, Rose, I think I just better grab my day planner and skedaddle.
LEADFEMALE:No, you don't want to skedaddle yet.
OTHERMALE:Don't you want to stay and have a drink before you go? Oh, sorry, I never drink and skedaddle.
OTHERMALE:Besides, I have to stay sharp.
LEADMALE:I've got a handball game with Captain Kangaroo.
SUPMALE:Ooh, why, you devil.
LEADFEMALE:Are you suggesting another time? Just name it.
OTHERMALE:I'll be there.
LEADFEMALE:Well Tomorrow, 2:30, the Empire Lounge.
LEADMALE:Well, sure.
SUPFEMALE:Why not? I'll see you there.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Jerry?   Oh, my, my, my, my, my! Why do I feel the need to bathe? So, how was it, Blanche? Oh, you might as well ask me to describe the glory of the Great Smoky Mountains as they rise from the mist of a Carolina dawn.
SUPMALE:They went to a sleazy motel.
LEADFEMALE:Or the colors of the monarch butterfly, spreading its wings as it emerges from the miracle of the cocoon.
SUPFEMALE:She got him to pay for half the room.
LEADMALE:Or the sturdy cypress reaching heavenward, tall and mighty and proud! That one I think is pretty self-explanatory.
LEADFEMALE:Who can that be at this hour? Oh, I bet it's Jerry comin' back for his good-night kiss.
SUPMALE:You know, sometimes you get so busy buttonin' up and all, you forget.
LEADMALE:How do you do? I'm Millicent Kennedy, Gerald's mother.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, how do you do? I'm looking for the cheap jezebel who's ruining my Gerald's life.
LEADMALE:Blanche, company! Blanche Devereaux, I'm here to tell you to keep your hands off my baby.
SUPFEMALE:He's very special, and no one can take care of him the way I can.
LEADMALE:Well, excuse me, but I haven't heard any complaints so far.
LEADMALE:Did you know that Gerald is afraid of clowns? Or that he can't go to the bathroom except at home? Oh, so that's why there's that look on his face right before they get to the weather.
LEADFEMALE:Just leave my dumpling alone, understand? Or else! Blanche, why did you let her go? She'd be the perfect person to ask if there's anything about Jerry I could make fun of at the roast.
OTHERMALE:We'll tell you what's wrong with us if you tell us what's wrong with you.
LEADFEMALE:That really won't be fair, will it, Stan? I mean, now they know what's wrong with us.
OTHERMALE:Well, Dorothy, the sooner we do this, the sooner you're rid of me.
SUPFEMALE:Stanley.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, Doc.
LEADFEMALE:You shaved the little beard.
SUPFEMALE:It's still $110, Stan.
LEADMALE:You must be Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Please, come in.
OTHERMALE:I've heard only good things about you, Doctor.
LEADMALE:You want a hug? Maybe later.
LEADMALE:Well, Doc, before you get started, I just want to say that I love this woman, and although she's angry, I believe she still loves me.
LEADMALE:So, please, please, Dr.
LEADMALE:Halperin, help the two of us put this crazy marriage back together.
LEADMALE:Only once, Stanley.
OTHERMALE:The night I told you it was good for me, too.
SUPFEMALE:And you said she didn't have a sense of humor.
SUPFEMALE:Stan, it sounds to me like you're going to extreme measures to make some kind of point here today.
SUPFEMALE:Now, why don't you just come out with that point? Come home, Mama Bear.
SUPFEMALE:Papa Bear gets so cold sleeping alone.
SUPMALE:Couldn't you just medicate him? I would love to, but I'm not allowed to write prescriptions for six months.
SUPMALE:Please, will you sit down, Stan? People, you may not believe it, but these issues are not insurmountable.
LEADFEMALE:It's not like that couple you were sitting next to in the waiting room.
SUPMALE:Major problems in the sack.
LEADMALE:Doctor, that's confidential.
LEADFEMALE:You shouldn't be telling us that.
OTHERMALE:I know, but I like you.
LEADMALE:Now, Stan, what you have to do is ask yourself, why would you want to be with a woman who so clearly doesn't want to be around you? Well, I think I can answer that, Doctor.
LEADMALE:There's no other kind.
LEADMALE:Last time we met, you told me that when you were a boy your mother didn't want you around.
SUPFEMALE:Well, so my mother didn't love me.
LEADMALE:I mean, what's that got to do with anything?  Doc, Sophia may not want to have me around, but that doesn't mean she doesn't love me.
LEADMALE:Stan, did you hear what you just said? Yes, I said you love me.
SUPFEMALE:You said, "Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:" You meant me, but you said Sophia.
LEADMALE:You know, that's interesting, Stan.
LEADFEMALE:You made that same slip in our last session.
LEADMALE:Who's Sophia? My mother.
LEADFEMALE:Calling Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Freud.
LEADMALE:Look, I can't say anything definitively, but there's strong evidence here that Stan doesn't actually love you.
SUPFEMALE:I don't? He doesn't? That's correct.
LEADMALE:A theory would be that he's neurotically obsessed with you.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, we could build on that.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, he's obsessed with your mother.
SUPFEMALE:Are you saying that his desire to be with me is really his desire to be with my mother? Wild, huh? It's all subconscious.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia represents Stan's own mother who passed away before the two of them could resolve things.
LEADMALE:Doc, this is rougher than the session when I thought I was in love with you.
LEADFEMALE:I still have the flowers.
LEADFEMALE:Stan, you see, in order to achieve closure, you need to hear Sophia, that is to say, your own mother tell you she loves you.
SUPFEMALE:Now, there's not much we can do here without Sophia being here.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, what are the chances you can get her to come to our next session? Gee, I--I don't know what to say.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, no one's ever asked me to bring her along before.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll do the best I can.
LEADMALE:Doc, what can I say? You're a miracle worker.
LEADFEMALE:It's all part of being professional.
SUPFEMALE:Now, who's my 3:00? Oh, great.
OTHERFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:"I'm scared of the dark" is next.
LEADMALE:Wanna hit the lights on the way out? Jerry is not a mama's boy.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, he and I came to a major understanding tonight.
OTHERMALE:He and his mother aren't gonna see any other girls? Jerry is simply a man who happens to be sensitive to his mother's needs.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, Blanche is right.
LEADMALE:Jerry's aware his mother is getting on in years.
LEADMALE:He's concerned about her happiness, and he's chosen to live at home with her because he can't go to the bathroom anyplace else.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, I think I have my opening for the roast.
LEADFEMALE:Listen.
LEADFEMALE:"Good evening, everyone.
SUPFEMALE:"I hope you enjoyed your Cornish game hen.
LEADMALE:"  What What's so funny about that? Oh, I didn't set it up.
SUPFEMALE:You see, we're serving Cornish game hen.
OTHERMALE:Oh, well, now that you've explained it.
LEADMALE:But this still doesn't say anything about Jerry.
LEADFEMALE:I know, I know, but I've drawn a blank.
LEADFEMALE:I even called his brother, and they haven't spoken since Jerry was arrested for public nudity.
LEADMALE:Damn it, there is just nothing funny about that clown-fearing, mama's boy! He is not a mama's boy.
LEADFEMALE:And to prove it, he has agreed to bring his mother over here tomorrow afternoon so he can stand up to her in front of me.
SUPMALE:Good for you, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:But if confronting Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Kennedy doesn't work, the three of you might consider a joint therapy session.
LEADMALE:Therapy's a wonderful idea.
LEADMALE:Oh, I remember St.
SUPFEMALE:Olaf's most famous psychotherapists, the Freud brothers, Sigmund and Roy.
LEADMALE:You may have read their bestseller, If I Have All the Cheese I Want, Why Am I Still Unhappy? Ma, all I know is, you would not believe the progress that Stanley is making.
SUPFEMALE:As a matter of fact, I was going to invite you to one of his sessions with Dr.
OTHERFEMALE:Halperin.
SUPMALE:The psychiatrist? Please.
LEADFEMALE:In the old days, we didn't need psychiatrists.
LEADFEMALE:You had a problem? You fought, you drank, you got a little on the side.
SUPMALE:You dealt with it.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't Splash Mountain.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, we're not going to Splash Mountain.
LEADMALE:I want you to meet Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Halperin.
OTHERFEMALE:He's Stan's psychiatrist.
OTHERMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Petrillo, I've heard a lot about you.
SUPMALE:Lies! All lies! Yes, I wanted a boy, but slowly I learned to accept her.
LEADFEMALE:I just meant it was nice to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:Oops.
LEADMALE:Please, sit down.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma, as you know, Stan's been having difficulty making it on his own.
OTHERFEMALE:Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Halperin believes that you can help him in his struggle to separate from me.
LEADMALE:Sure I can.
SUPMALE:Stay away from my daughter or I'll have your legs broken.
SUPMALE:Ma, will you try to be serious? I mean, where are you going to get the $400? Just a rough guess.
LEADMALE:Sophia, without going into a lot of psychological detail, I believe Stan's clinging to Dorothy is really a suppressed longing for his mother's love.
LEADMALE:Now, my theory is that, subconsciously, he's transferred that longing to you.
LEADMALE:And if you're wrong? I owe the parking guys a round of drinks.
LEADMALE:Look, Ma, tell Stan you love him.
LEADMALE:He'll be out of our lives forever.
LEADMALE:You don't even love him.
LEADMALE:How am I supposed to? I'll give you $1,000.
SUPFEMALE:Sonny boy! That's-- That's enough, the both of you.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't the way it's supposed to be.
LEADMALE:If it isn't real, what does it mean? Let's just forget it.
LEADMALE:What, you're surprised? I'm supposed to love you? Oh, sure, Stan, I love you.
LEADMALE:I love you for knocking up my daughter when she was 17 years old.
SUPMALE:For sponging off Sal and me for eight years.
LEADFEMALE:For cheating on Dorothy left, right, and sideways.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, I love you.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, listen, I know I always haven't been the best son-in-law, but I've got other memories.
LEADMALE:Good memories.
LEADMALE:The four of us watching TV on that ugly green sofa Sal bought from his boss.
LEADMALE:Summer weekends on the Jersey shore.
LEADMALE:It hasn't been all bad.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, help me out here.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy? I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
LEADMALE:Look, if I have hurt somebody, I am sorry.
LEADMALE:But you should know, I've hurt myself worse.
SUPMALE:Sophia, I did the best I could.
SUPFEMALE:I suppose you did.
SUPFEMALE:Can't you find it anyplace in your heart to forgive me? Any place in your heart when you loved me? Have you loved me ever? There was that one morning at St.
LEADMALE:Francis Hospital.
OTHERMALE:You and me peeking through the maternity window the first time they wheeled Dorothy and little Michael out.
LEADMALE:There was a whole happy future in your smile.
LEADMALE:I suppose I did.
LEADMALE:I suppose I do.
LEADFEMALE:I do love you, Stan.
OTHERMALE:I love you, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, this is great.
SUPMALE:But I want you to understand, this is just the first step.
LEADFEMALE:Doctor, you are a genius.
LEADMALE:I feel great! Let's go to dinner and celebrate.
SUPFEMALE:How does Chinese food sound? I love Chinese food.
LEADMALE:Oh, why not? A celebratory dinner to bury the hatchet.
LEADFEMALE:Who invited you? Don't wait up.
LEADMALE:You know, I cannot remember when I had a sponge cake quite so m-moist.
LEADMALE:Extremely moist.
LEADMALE:The moistest.
SUPFEMALE:I found the tea rather moist, as well.
LEADFEMALE:What? I can't be uncomfortable, too? Well, all these raves have put me in the mood for another slice.
LEADFEMALE:Gerald, do you really feel you need another slice? Oh, well, maybe you're right, Mother.
LEADMALE:The television camera does exaggerate the pounds.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I don't see where a little sliver would hurt.
LEADFEMALE:Finally, some action.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Blanche, I really shouldn't.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Jerry, you should.
OTHERFEMALE:No, he shouldn't.
SUPMALE:He's watching his refined sugar intake.
LEADMALE:Yes, he should.
LEADMALE:This cake is sweetened with natural fruit juices.
SUPFEMALE:No, he shouldn't.
SUPMALE:His cross-country skiing machine is in the shop.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, he should.
LEADMALE:He gets plenty, and I mean plenty, of exercise with me.
LEADMALE:Checkmate.
SUPMALE:Hand the guy a fork.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe I shouldn't, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, t-this darn girdle is tight enough as it is.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, did you catch that? I sure did, my friend.
SUPMALE:"Darn girdle.
SUPMALE:" The man refuses to curse.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, if you're going to insist on contradicting every opinion I have, I won't allow Gerald to continue seeing you.
LEADMALE:Allow me? Allow Mother, this is where it stops.
SUPFEMALE:See what happens? You put sugar in his tea, didn't you? It is not the sugar, Mother! It's you! Mama's boy, huh? This is my life.
SUPMALE:I'm a grown man, and I am going to love the woman I want to love, whether she meets with your approval or not!  Put this man's picture on a can of stew.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, I want to thank you for showing me the light.
LEADFEMALE:How can I ever repay you? Hawaii.
SUPMALE:Big Island.
OTHERFEMALE:Mother, you are just going to have to live with your prejudices.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't care what your objections are.
LEADFEMALE:I've made up my mind, and I'm going to be with the woman I love! Oh, Jerry! I'm going back to Christina.
LEADMALE:Thanks again, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Gerald, wait! We don't like Christina, remember? Blanche, honey, you okay? Oh, why do these things keep happenin' to me? And why do I let them keep happenin'? I'm just tired of gettin' all dressed up, lookin' gorgeous, going out, only to lose out in the end.
LEADMALE:On the other hand, I am dressed up, and I do look gorgeous, and it is gringo night at Hernando's Hacienda.
LEADMALE:Oh, but I don't think I ought to go.
LEADMALE:I'm just so vulnerable.
SUPFEMALE:Does anyone know how to say vulnerable in Spanish? Oh, never mind, I'll say it with my eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Adios.
OTHERFEMALE:I said it before, and I'll say it again.
LEADFEMALE:Sluts just heal quicker.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:I'm in heaven And my heart beats so that I can hardly What are you all looking at? You.
OTHERMALE:What are you so happy about? If I know my Dorothy, there's only one thing that makes her this happy.
LEADMALE:You're going back to Shady Pines? No, you moron.
SUPFEMALE:She has a date.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Is that true, Dorothy? Do you have a date tonight? Rose, I mean, that's an awfully personal question to Yes! Oh, good God.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy Zbornak has a date on a Saturday night and Blanche Devereaux does not? That sounds like an idea for a Stephen King book.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I wasn't going to tell you who I'm going out with tonight because I thought it might hurt your feelings, but I realize now that's a plus.
LEADFEMALE:It so happens I'm having dinner with Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Lee Kagan, a medical corporation.
LEADMALE:Not our Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Kagan? The Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Lee Kagan I love more than life itself? Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Kagan? Hubba-hubba-zing-zing, baby, he's got everything.
OTHERMALE:But I've been disrobing in front of Dr.
LEADMALE:Kagan for three years.
LEADFEMALE:Why would he ask you out when he's seen the promised land? I really don't know.
LEADMALE:Too many squatters? Don't wait up.
SUPMALE:Hold it right there.
LEADFEMALE:He's not picking you up? What kind of guy doesn't pick up his date? Oh, no, we just decided to meet at L'Auberge.
LEADFEMALE:It's no big deal.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, wait just a minute.
LEADFEMALE:This whole thing is a trick, isn't it? You're just tryin' to make us think you're goin' out with Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Kagan.
SUPFEMALE:I am not lying.
SUPMALE:You're just jealous about the fact that I have a date on a Saturday night and you don't.
SUPMALE:Saturday night? Kids' stuff.
SUPFEMALE:Get lucky on a Tuesday morning, then call me.
LEADMALE:I guess I'm just not attracted to crossing guards.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, a guy sets a folding chair up in front of my house, I want to know more.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm off.
LEADFEMALE:If you need something to keep you occupied tonight, Rose, why don't you take out a good book and see if you can find Waldo?  I've never liked her.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care what Dorothy says.
LEADFEMALE:Any man who doesn't pick a lady up at her home for their date is a jerk, plain and simple.
SUPMALE:Well, yeah, he's obviously a jerk.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he's taking her to L'Auberge.
LEADFEMALE:Jerks love that place.
SUPMALE:I went there once with the biggest jerk in the whole world.
LEADMALE:It was right after Charlie died.
SUPMALE:I had just moved to Miami, I was very vulnerable, and I did something that I I guess was a little dumb.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPMALE:I agreed to go out on a blind date.
LEADFEMALE:This is my favorite restaurant.
SUPFEMALE:Have you ever been here before? No, I'm just starting to get back in the social scene.
LEADMALE:And it isn't easy.
LEADFEMALE:There are just so many jerks out there.
LEADMALE:You don't have to worry about me.
SUPMALE:I'm so normal, I'm dull.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're not dull.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, compared to not dating at all.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, maybe I shouldn't say this, because some day I hope to be a Supreme Court Justice, but you are quite a babe.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Oh, this is a nice place.
LEADMALE:Do you come here a lot? Oh, no, not really.
SUPMALE:I don't have much of a social life.
SUPFEMALE:So, this is where you bring your cheap, fake-blonde floozies.
LEADFEMALE:John, you disgust me.
LEADFEMALE:And as far as I'm concerned, we're through.
LEADMALE:Who was that? My sister.
LEADMALE:May I recommend the The Poulet Veronique? John, I have a rule.
LEADMALE:If I can't pronounce it, I don't put it in my mouth.
OTHERMALE:Say, do they have gougenflucter? Alan.
LEADFEMALE:Alan, please talk to me.
SUPFEMALE:You haven't answered my calls.
LEADMALE:You don't answer my letters.
LEADMALE:Alan, please.
OTHERMALE:What can I say? What can I do to get you back? Alan? Nickname.
LEADFEMALE:Susan, uh, Susan, please.
LEADMALE:Uh, this is not the time or the place.
LEADFEMALE:It's me, isn't it? I've driven you away.
LEADFEMALE:What if I dyed my hair? I'd even dye it that color.
LEADMALE:If they still make that color.
SUPMALE:Susan, it's over, and you have to accept that.
OTHERFEMALE:And a word of warning, I haven't graded your final exam yet.
LEADMALE:So, shall we order separate entrees and share? Hold it, who was that? Okay, okay, so I've had a couple of bad relationships with women.
SUPFEMALE:That's not so unusual.
LEADMALE:Now, where is our waiter? Would Oh, waiter!  Well, well, Peter.
LEADFEMALE:We just swing the way the wind blows, don't we? And who's this? Glinda, the Good Witch of the North? You disgust me.
SUPFEMALE:After the way you've treated me, I should scratch your eyes out.
SUPMALE:Call me.
SUPFEMALE:Poker buddy.
OTHERMALE:You know, I don't think this dinner was such a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:Now, Rose, please don't leap to conclusions.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry, John, but I think I'll just catch a cab home.
LEADMALE:Rose, you're hurting my feelings.
SUPMALE:Believe me, this is not what it seems.
LEADMALE:John Patrick Anderson is a regular guy.
LEADMALE:Shlomo Ziegler? Yes? You're under arrest.
LEADFEMALE:Your days as the Freeway Flasher are over.
LEADFEMALE:I know what you're thinking, Rose, but you're wrong.
SUPMALE:And if I can make bail, I'd love to see you tomorrow night.
SUPMALE:I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:May I call you? I--I get one phone call.
LEADMALE:Men.
LEADFEMALE:I think we both need a hug.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he was such a jerk.
LEADFEMALE:And he was no better on our second date.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe my pussycat's been out with that guy for three hours.
LEADMALE:I'm getting worried.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I should call the police.
LEADFEMALE:Nah, he's probably okay.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, it's after midnight.
LEADFEMALE:She must be having a good time.
LEADFEMALE:Not necessarily.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean? Oh, don't you remember a date you and I had a few years back? Oh, that.
LEADMALE:New Year's Eve.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Oh, I remember.
SUPMALE:You and Dorothy were in New York, and I had planned to spend the evening alone.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, that was before Blanche brought those two brothers home from the Rusty Anchor.
LEADMALE:How could you do this to me, Blanche? You knew I wanted to spend tonight alone.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, nobody who says they want to be alone on New Year's Eve ever really means it.
LEADMALE:I did.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you're a freak.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, it's bad luck if you don't get kissed at midnight.
LEADFEMALE:Why, my New Year's Eve kiss is the most important one of the whole year.
LEADMALE:It sets the tone for the next 365 days.
SUPFEMALE:One year, I didn't get kissed at midnight on New Year's Eve, I didn't get lucky till after the Orange Bowl.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if being kissed is all you care about, why didn't you just stay at the Rusty Anchor? Oh, it was too crowded.
SUPMALE:They threw you out again, didn't they? Like I'm the only person who ever mixed a margarita in a sailor's mouth.
SUPMALE:Hi, fellows.
LEADFEMALE:Here's something you two can nibble on.
LEADMALE:And we brought you some hors d'oeuvres, too.
LEADMALE:Rose, isn't there something you want to show Arnie out on the lanai? Oh, now that you mention it, Blanche No, there isn't.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, you remember our signal when I want you to leave? You wouldn't hit me in front of company.
SUPMALE:Come on, Arnie, I--I want to show you the answer to a riddle.
LEADMALE:What's Irish and stays out all night? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:What, Rose? Paddy O'Furniture.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna get you for this, Bob.
OTHERMALE:Well, Bob, I finally have you all to myself.
SUPMALE:Why don't I fix us some drinks, huh? Actually, I don't drink.
LEADMALE:Oh, then I know what'll loosen us up.
SUPMALE:We can play a game with my naughty cards from Denmark.
LEADMALE:Aces are high and I'm wild.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I really don't gamble either, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, believe me.
SUPFEMALE:It's no gamble.
SUPMALE:But you know what I do like? I like music.
LEADMALE:Music? Well, wonderful, we can dance.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, we can do one of those hot, sweaty South American dances they do in the street 'cause they don't have television sets.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you got me again, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I don't dance.
SUPFEMALE:You don't drink, you don't gamble, you don't dance.
LEADFEMALE:By God, what are you, a priest? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:So, uh, where are you guys from? I think I detected an accent.
LEADMALE:What does it matter? Life is just one bottomless pit of muck and despair.
SUPFEMALE:Let me guess.
LEADFEMALE:New Jersey? Rose, I can't pretend, even on New Year's Eve.
SUPFEMALE:The truth is, I recently lost my beloved wife.
LEADFEMALE:She's gone.
LEADMALE:And it's on nights like this when it It really hits me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Arnie, I'm so sorry.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's moments like this that it helps to know that time heals all.
SUPMALE:You know what else works? A good back rub.
SUPFEMALE:So I left the priesthood four months ago.
LEADFEMALE:It was a very difficult decision for me.
LEADFEMALE:But after a lot of soul-searching, everybody agreed that I could do more good on the outside.
SUPMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:So I guess these last four months have just been one big party, huh?  Well, I haven't been to any discotheques yet, if that's what you mean.
SUPFEMALE:I guess these last four months have just been one big party, huh?  Well, I haven't been to any discotheques yet, if that's what you mean.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, my brother Arnie dragged me out tonight.
LEADFEMALE:This is my first date.
SUPMALE:You mean Your first date ever? That's right.
LEADFEMALE:I've never been with a woman.
SUPFEMALE:Well, not in the biblical sense.
LEADFEMALE:Whoops, there I go again.
LEADMALE:You can take the boy out of the seminary Let me get this straight.
LEADMALE:Um You've never Never, ever? Not once.
LEADMALE:Have you even thought about it? Only all the time.
LEADFEMALE:To be honest, I've never even seen a naked lady.
SUPMALE:So what we're saying here is, you're a virgin? A virgin.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, God.
LEADMALE:This brings out the artist in me.
LEADFEMALE:So you can imagine how relieved Farmer Gunlinger was when he looked up and saw it wasn't his cow up in that tree.
LEADFEMALE:Arnie, what What's the matter? The cow story.
LEADFEMALE:My wife's name was Elsie.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Arnie, I'm so How can I make you feel better? You know what would make me feel better? You could hold me.
SUPFEMALE:Now, how's that? Better.
LEADMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:You know, Blanche, you really don't have to do this.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, but I want to, Bob.
LEADMALE:Your first time should be really special.
LEADFEMALE:You need a woman who won't make you nervous or put unrealistic demands on you.
LEADFEMALE:A woman who'll be tender and kind and gentle.
LEADFEMALE:Where the heck is that riding crop? Are you sure this is helping you get over your grief? I think so.
LEADFEMALE:But you know what would make me feel even better than this? What? A--A kiss.
LEADFEMALE:A New Year's Eve kiss.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:In memory of my late wife.
LEADMALE:When you put it that way, I Now, you know what would make me feel really great? So, tell me how you're feelin', Bob.
OTHERMALE:Nervous.
LEADFEMALE:Excited.
LEADMALE:Spiritually confused.
LEADFEMALE:Did I mention excited? Let the games begin.
SUPMALE:Oh, boy.
OTHERMALE:So, how do I start? Oh, how do we start, Bob.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, 98 times out of 100, I think the best way to start is with a kiss.
LEADFEMALE:What are the other two? Baby steps, Bob.
SUPFEMALE:Baby steps.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, boy.
SUPMALE:You are gross and disgusting and you make my skin crawl.
OTHERMALE:You can help me change.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, what's going on? Oh, well, Arnie thinks I'm gonna sleep with him because his wife died.
SUPMALE:Hold it, Elsie's not dead.
SUPFEMALE:She's at a fat farm in Sarasota.
SUPFEMALE:Now the truth's out, Rose, don't you feel sorry for me? Get out! Call you? Get out! What is it with men? Why would you want to have sex with somebody you've only known a few hours? Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:Why can't they understand that sex is no good if it isn't with someone you love? Rose.
LEADMALE:Oh, the very thought of it makes me feel dirty.
LEADMALE:Rose! Oh, gosh.
LEADFEMALE:She's right.
SUPFEMALE:I do feel dirty.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't worry.
LEADMALE:You'll get used to it.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, I'm going home, getting down on my knees, and begging for forgiveness.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, we can do that.
SUPMALE:Wait!  But I didn't get my New Year's kiss, and it's almost midnight! Darn it.
OTHERFEMALE:I gotta kiss somebody at midnight.
LEADMALE:MAN ON 
LEADMALE:Five, four, three, two, one Happy New Year!  Don't even think about it.
LEADMALE:So what you're saying is, this guy was a jerk because he didn't sleep with you? Well, yeah.
LEADMALE:What did you think I was sayin'? Gosh, it's gettin' late.
OTHERFEMALE:I bet it's after 1:00 and Dorothy's not home.
LEADMALE:I guess Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Kagan's turning out to be wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Or maybe he drugged her and sold her into white slavery.
SUPMALE:Either way, I'm glad she's out of the house.
LEADFEMALE:Now, sit back and listen, I got a jerk story.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Picture it.
OTHERFEMALE:Brooklyn, 1948.
LEADFEMALE:My friend's son was helping me out around the house.
SUPMALE:I was expecting Dorothy home from the library any minute.
LEADFEMALE:I finished stacking those crates for you, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Petrillo.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Myron.
LEADFEMALE:You're a good kid.
LEADMALE:In fact, before you go, I'd like to have a little talk with you.
OTHERMALE:Sit.
SUPMALE:As you know, Myron, I've always thought of you as a bright, polite young man.
SUPMALE:Talented, ambitious, smart I'm not going out with your daughter, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Petrillo.
SUPFEMALE:You've got to, Myron.
LEADFEMALE:She's spending too much time with this yutz named Zbornak.
LEADMALE:She has to see what a real date is like.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Petrillo.
LEADFEMALE:She's just not my type.
SUPMALE:I see.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, how about Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Hamilton.
SUPMALE:Is he your type? What time should I pick her up? something pretty.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, but if you want me to kiss her good night, it's gonna cost you extra.
SUPMALE:But no tongue.
LEADMALE:Ah, what the hell? Oh, look, my beautiful daughter is home from school.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, pussycat, Sam.
LEADMALE:It's Stan, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Petrillo.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:Now find someone who cares.
LEADMALE:Ma, we've got something really important to tell you.
LEADMALE:It can wait.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, you remember Myron, don't you? Listen, Ma.
LEADMALE:We gotta talk now.
LEADMALE:Don't be rude, Dorothy, we have a guest.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you have something to say, Myron? Uh, Dorothy, I was wondering if you would do me the honor of going out with me tomorrow night? Well, what do you say, Dorothy? I'm pregnant.
OTHERMALE:This is gonna cost a lot more.
SUPFEMALE:Deal's off, Myron.
LEADFEMALE:You better go.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:But what about this? Hush money.
LEADMALE:Honestly, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Petrillo, I don't know how this happened.
SUPFEMALE:Hmm, let's see.
SUPFEMALE:Did you both drink out of the same cup? Stanley, go into the kitchen.
LEADMALE:I wanna talk to Ma in private.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Ma.
SUPMALE:I know I've disappointed you.
SUPFEMALE:How could you let this happen, Dorothy? How could you throw everything away for an hour's worth of passion? I don't know.
LEADMALE:It just sort of What do you mean an hour's worth? It's supposed to take an hour? And what happens to your dream? You were gonna be the first Petrillo to go to college.
LEADMALE:You were gonna be a teacher.
SUPFEMALE:I'm still gonna be a teacher, Ma.
LEADMALE:This won't change that.
SUPMALE:Now, when you say an hour, does that include everything? Oh, God, Dorothy, we've gotta get you married.
LEADFEMALE:Stan's asked me to marry him.
LEADFEMALE:But who? Who could we get? Who? Who? Who? I told Stan yes.
SUPFEMALE:Did you sign anything? Ma I guess we have no choice.
OTHERMALE:My baby is having a baby.
LEADMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, I'm scared.
SUPFEMALE:Look, pussycat, even though it's gonna hurt a lot, and I do mean a lot, there's something very special about bringing a new life into this world.
LEADFEMALE:And this child's got a lot of love waiting for him right here.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, Ma.
LEADMALE:I don't believe I did this.
LEADMALE:And I hate his name.
OTHERMALE:For the rest of my life I'm gonna be Dorothy Zbornak.
LEADMALE:Ah, come on, pussycat, look on the bright side.
OTHERFEMALE:At least he's got a full head of hair.
SUPFEMALE:Wow, Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:That was some story.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, it was.
LEADMALE:Funny, touching, with a surprise twist ending.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder if it was true.
SUPMALE:Ah, damn that stroke.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dorothy, you're home.
LEADFEMALE:Well, doesn't anyone want to hear how my date turned out? Oh, honey, was it just terrible? Oh, sweetheart, you can tell us.
LEADFEMALE:It was wonderful.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? Where is Dr.
LEADMALE:Marvelous? What kind of a man doesn't walk a girl to the door? One who's too exhausted to walk.
LEADMALE:Dorothy Zbornak, I am shocked, and I want details.
LEADFEMALE:I tell you the night was just magical.
SUPFEMALE:We laughed, we danced, we drank, we cried, we did it all.
LEADMALE:Even No, I can't tell you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm too shy.
SUPMALE:
SUPMALE:Oh, Dorothy, three days on a romantic Caribbean cruise.
SUPFEMALE:I envy you.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:It's no big deal.
LEADFEMALE:What is it? Three days at sea with a man.
SUPFEMALE:A man who's a doctor.
SUPFEMALE:A great big doctor in a tiny little room with me.
LEADFEMALE:You were saying? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, well, let's very quickly go over this checklist to see if you've packed everything you're gonna need for your fun, fun, fun in the sun.
SUPFEMALE:Nausea pills? Took them.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Seasick skin patch? Wearing it.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Those tiny little stop-you-up tablets that I got for my visit to Mexico? The bottle was empty.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, I'll be fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Now listen, honey, while I'm gone, I'm putting you in charge of Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Me? Why Why me and not Rose? Rose couldn't keep our rock garden alive.
LEADMALE:What, I'm gonna give her my mother? Now look, as for instructions Mmm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Ma is to be fed twice a day.
LEADMALE:Walk her after her second meal.
LEADMALE:Second meal.
SUPMALE:And don't give her anything liquid after 10:00.
LEADMALE:Hey, what is this? You're talking about me like I'm an animal.
OTHERFEMALE:You've been with a man, haven't you? Honey, tell Rose goodbye for me, will you? Have a wonderful time.
OTHERMALE:And listen, don't forget to moan.
LEADMALE:Helps keep a man focused.
SUPMALE:Oh, God.
SUPFEMALE:Just like that.
LEADFEMALE: Now, Ma, you're gonna do what Blanche tells you? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You're not going to give her any trouble? No.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna be Blanche's little helper? Yes.
LEADMALE:I love you.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, too.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, pussycat.
SUPMALE:Fasten your seat belt, slut puppy.
SUPMALE:This ain't gonna be no cakewalk.
OTHERFEMALE:Mmm! What a meal, Rose.
LEADMALE:And what a deal, Rose.
SUPMALE:Uncle Cluck's, "Tastes Just Like Chicken" all-you-can-eat buffet.
OTHERFEMALE:You love your early bird specials.
LEADFEMALE:You bet.
LEADMALE:Especially when they forget to collect the coupon.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Admit it.
SUPMALE:Wasn't it worth a trip to the bad part of town? That guy almost got my purse, Miles! Almost doesn't count, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:How about those Cajun drumsticks? Oh, I can still smell those Cajun drumsticks.
OTHERMALE:I'm not surprised, you put one in each pocket.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's tomorrow's lunch, sweetheart.
OTHERMALE:Hey, I gotta run.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:Hi, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Blanche.
OTHERMALE:Honey, is something wrong? Well, it's Miles.
LEADMALE:Lately he's gotten I don't know, really tight, and I hate it.
OTHERMALE:Oh? Well, I'm just the opposite.
OTHERMALE:I love a tight man.
LEADMALE:Tight man with cast-iron pecs, thighs that could choke a bear, and a butt you could eat breakfast off of.
SUPMALE:Then the two of us would Rose, when did you get in? Blanche, I've been here the whole time.
SUPMALE:I was telling you about Miles being tight.
LEADMALE:Oh, I love a tight man.
OTHERMALE:A tight man with cast-iron pecs, thighs No, tight with money.
SUPMALE:He's cheap.
SUPMALE:Oh, tight with money? Dump him.
LEADMALE:Blanche, this is serious.
LEADMALE:And it's getting worse.
OTHERMALE:Like last Friday, I asked him to take me someplace special.
LEADFEMALE:You know what he did? He snuck us into an AA meeting.
LEADFEMALE:"Theater of the living," he calls it, with free refreshments after.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you've always known Miles was frugal.
LEADMALE:He's more than frugal.
OTHERMALE:He's fricking frugal.
SUPFEMALE:Why, Rose! It's a Scandinavian term.
LEADFEMALE:Honest.
LEADMALE:Sophia, what's goin' on? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing!  
SUPMALE:Aha! Sophia? Sophia? Are you all right? I'm okay.
LEADMALE:I'm okay.
LEADFEMALE:But that antique chest of Dorothy's? She's not gonna like what you let me do to it.
SUPFEMALE:You just listen to what I'm tellin' you.
LEADFEMALE:You live under my roof, you live under my rules.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, live under this.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, please.
LEADMALE:How am I supposed to keep you out of trouble? Why are you going through Dorothy's things? 'Cause I've already been through yours.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God, this box is a treasure trove! I guess as long as you already have it out, let's just see what Dorothy's hidin' from us.
SUPMALE:Pictures and doo-dads What's this? Huh.
LEADMALE:1920.
LEADMALE:Well, Sophia, you wrote this.
OTHERMALE:"Things I Want To Accomplish Before I Die.
LEADFEMALE:" The list! The list! You've found my list! Oh, Blanche, read it to me.
LEADFEMALE:Those were my dreams, my goals.
OTHERFEMALE:Number one, "Lose 200 pounds.
LEADMALE:" Done it.
LEADFEMALE:Number two, "Never be burden to children in old age.
LEADMALE:" Moving on.
LEADFEMALE:Three, "Make amends with Guido Spirelli.
LEADMALE:" Who's Guido Spirelli? Guido Spirelli was my first husband in Sicily.
OTHERFEMALE:It was an arranged marriage I had annulled.
SUPFEMALE:I left him a broken man.
LEADMALE:And I vowed one day I would make amends.
OTHERMALE:You know, Sophia, finding this list was a sign.
LEADFEMALE:You must make things right with that man.
LEADMALE:Now, go to your room and write him a long letter.
SUPFEMALE:Make your words thorough, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Make them fearless.
LEADFEMALE:Don't stop till you have said everything.
LEADFEMALE:Take two or three days if you have to.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:You're a good friend.
SUPFEMALE:I just wish Sophia were my mother.
LEADMALE:Then I could put her in Shady Pines.
LEADMALE:Oh, good, Rose, here you are.
SUPMALE:Honey, listen, I have been giving it some serious thought, and I have finally come up with a perfect solution for your very sensitive problem with Miles.
LEADFEMALE:What? Cheat on him.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't cheat on Miles.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, maybe cheat isn't quite the right word.
LEADMALE:Just think of it as one night out with my rich friends from Texas.
LEADMALE:Well, why isn't that cheating? 'Cause you're not gonna get caught.
LEADMALE:Come on, Rose.
OTHERMALE:Just think about it.
LEADFEMALE:A delicious dinner at an elegant restaurant.
SUPFEMALE:At night.
SUPFEMALE:You mean no coupons, Blanche? No coupons, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Chefs who don't wear pirate hats? Oh, I don't think so.
OTHERFEMALE:And he'll pay for everything? I don't have to leave the tip? That's right.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna cheat on Miles.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna to cheat on Miles.
LEADMALE:You mean I can have another Diet Coke? Of course you can, darlin'.
SUPFEMALE:Why, she's even more charmin' than you said, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Matter of fact, waiter, bottle of your best champagne.
SUPMALE:Did you hear that? Last time I had champagne, Miles and I crashed a bar mitzvah.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, Blanche, you have a large tuchus.
LEADMALE:That better mean bosom.
LEADMALE:Barry, I do think that champagne is a wonderful idea, but shouldn't we make it a case? I may want to take a bath later.
SUPFEMALE:Fair enough.
LEADFEMALE:But if I'm buyin' it, I'm gonna be sittin' in it.
LEADMALE:Hey, hi, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Rose? Miles! What're you doing here? Well, not that it matters, but I was on my way to the "theater of the living.
OTHERMALE:" I thought I'd pop in and purchase a couple of day-old eclairs.
LEADMALE:Which, incidentally, are for a dinner I'm making you next week.
LEADMALE:But the better question is, what What are you doing here? And with these dandies, yet.
SUPFEMALE:Dandies? Pretty tough words for somebody buying eclairs.
SUPMALE:Miles, it isn't what it looks like.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, this has nothing to do with romance.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean, it's not romantic? Oh, Rose, how could you do this? Oh, Miles.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that I really wanted to come to this restaurant.
LEADMALE:I didn't mean to eat behind your back.
OTHERMALE:I was gonna take you to a lovely restaurant tomorrow night.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Cap'n Sam's Twilight Two-For-One Special.
OTHERFEMALE:"A nice piece of perch, your choice of potatoes or rice.
LEADFEMALE:" Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:I see you conveniently left out "with a generous helping of slaw.
SUPMALE:" Oh, or doesn't that serve your little smear campaign? Blanche, it was your idea! It's the execution, Rose.
SUPMALE:I said, "Don't get caught.
LEADFEMALE:" Well, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
LEADMALE:I mean, what if he doesn't come back? What if I've lost him? What if I turn into a lonely, old spinster and never find love again?  Look, Garfield caught a fish.
LEADMALE:Oh, boy, there's just nothin' like startin' out the day with a big pile of eggs and cinnamon toast.
LEADMALE:Oh, damn, almost forgot.
LEADMALE:The old lady's got to eat.
LEADMALE:She isn't here.
SUPFEMALE:What? She isn't here.
OTHERMALE:She left.
SUPMALE:Last night.
OTHERMALE:You didn't know? No, I did not know! What do you mean, "left"? Where'd she go? Sicily.
SUPMALE:To square things with Guido.
LEADFEMALE:Sicily? What are you talkin' about, Sicily? She said she cleared it with you.
OTHERMALE:She did not clear it with me.
SUPFEMALE:Then giving her my Visa card was a bad thing? Rose, now how are we supposed to find her? Angelo.
LEADMALE:I'll call her brother Angelo.
LEADFEMALE:He'll know where she is.
LEADMALE:Rose, this is terrible! What do you think Dorothy's gonna do? Remember what she was like when you lost her keys? She uprooted a mighty sequoia.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, on the other hand, she is off on a romantic cruise, so maybe he'll fall in love with her and she'll come home happy.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a dead woman.
LEADMALE:Oh, Angelo.
LEADMALE:Sweets for my sweet.
SUPMALE:Flowers for my flower, and cigarettes for after.
SUPMALE:Angelo, what are you doing? May I quote what you said on the phone? "Angelo, I need you.
OTHERFEMALE:"Come over, quick.
LEADMALE:Sophia's not here.
LEADFEMALE:" I--I didn't mean it that way.
LEADFEMALE:Are you telling me I shaved my shoulders for nothing? As much as that does sweeten the pot, I still didn't mean it that way.
SUPMALE:I get it.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it.
LEADFEMALE:I--I don't need you.
LEADFEMALE:I've had hundreds of women.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, magazines.
OTHERFEMALE:Angelo, please.
SUPFEMALE:Now, we have a real problem.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia is missing and you are my last hope.
LEADFEMALE:I've already tried calling Sicily's Department of Missing Persons.
LEADFEMALE:They just laughed at me.
LEADMALE:You called Missing Persons in Sicily? You got it wrong.
LEADFEMALE:You call them to lose somebody.
LEADMALE:Well, what should I do? Do you Do you know anything about Guido Spirelli? I think maybe she went there to try and find him.
OTHERFEMALE:You kidding? I know him like a book.
OTHERFEMALE:I know his tastes.
LEADFEMALE:I know his tendencies.
SUPFEMALE:I know he hates humidity.
LEADFEMALE:And if I don't miss my guess, I could pinpoint his location exactly.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank God! He's someplace air-conditioned.
LEADFEMALE:You're not being any help at all.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody's being any help at all.
LEADMALE:I don't know what in God's name I'm gonna do.
LEADFEMALE:Take it easy.
SUPMALE:If I know my sister, she's playing a trick, looking for a little laugh.
LEADFEMALE:Now, relax.
SUPFEMALE:I'll bet Sophia is here before dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Hey, Mr.
LEADMALE:Occupato, what are you doing in there, painting the Sistine Chapel? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Pit stop! Pit stop! Whoa! Guido? Guido Spirelli? It's me, Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:I've come a long way to speak to you.
OTHERFEMALE:Many years ago, I wronged you.
OTHERFEMALE:I broke your heart.
LEADMALE:And because of that, I've been suffering all these years.
LEADFEMALE:I just want you to know how sorry I am.
LEADMALE:From the bottom of my heart, Guido, I apologize.
LEADMALE:I apologize for ruining your life.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, forget about it.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to do this, Miles.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I do, Rose.
SUPMALE:I have to show you how much I've changed.
LEADMALE:Rose, you're a first-class woman, you deserve to be treated in a first-class manner.
SUPFEMALE:Miles Webber.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mr.
LEADMALE:Webber, of course.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, listen, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but the restaurant's begun a new policy.
LEADMALE:We're now donating all our day-old pastries to the mission.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not here for pastries.
LEADMALE:The bread, too? Yes, sir.
OTHERMALE:Well, I believe you'll find my name on the reservations schedule.
LEADMALE:Oh, indeed.
LEADFEMALE:Here it is.
LEADMALE:Webber, for two.
LEADFEMALE:Right this way.
LEADMALE:Hey, Carl, Webber's eating! I hope you'll find this satisfactory.
LEADMALE:Your waiter will be with you in a moment.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, here we are.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Here we are.
LEADMALE:You know, it's kind of nice not having to holler your order into the clown's mouth.
LEADMALE:The trout amandine looks nice, doesn't it? The trout? Well, I'm I'm not sure.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, oh, yes, yes! Yes, it does.
SUPMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:Mmm-hmm.
OTHERFEMALE:That chateaubriand that couple over there is eating looks even better.
LEADFEMALE:Then, Miles, have it.
LEADMALE:I couldn't.
SUPMALE:I think they're going to finish it.
SUPFEMALE:Your own, Miles.
LEADFEMALE:Order your own.
LEADMALE:Good evening.
LEADFEMALE:Have the two of you decided yet? Ah, y-yes.
SUPFEMALE:The lady will be having the The $18.
LEADFEMALE:50.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, the trout.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes, of course, the trout.
SUPMALE:And you, sir? Uh I'll just have a glass of water.
SUPMALE:I ate before we came.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:That's one bottled water.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:That's tap water.
LEADFEMALE:I have a chlorine deficiency.
OTHERMALE:Miles, what is going on? I thought you were gonna loosen up.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you've always been frugal, but lately it's gotten out of hand.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I guess it all started about a month ago when I went to see my doctor.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God, Miles.
LEADFEMALE:Is something wrong? Yes.
LEADMALE:He said I'm probably gonna live to be 100.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, I'm only budgeted to live until I'm 80.
LEADFEMALE:What? Don't you see, Rose? I'm a man living on a fixed income.
SUPFEMALE:All of a sudden, I'm afraid.
LEADMALE:I mean, I'll be retiring soon.
LEADFEMALE:What if I don't have enough left? Why didn't you just tell me? I understand what you're going through.
LEADFEMALE:All people our age do.
LEADFEMALE:You know what? Once in a while, I could pay for a nice meal, too.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Rose Well, yes.
LEADMALE:Yes, you could.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Miles, this is all my fault.
LEADMALE:I should be a person who's more accepting.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it isn't like I'm Miss Perfect.
LEADMALE:I probably do all sorts of things that annoy you.
LEADMALE:Oh, not really.
SUPMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:It would do us both a world of good to hear the things you'd change about me.
LEADMALE:Nah, but, well, there is one thing, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:You hum, Rose.
LEADMALE:I hum? Softly, happily, incessantly.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, I come over in the morning, and you hum as you're cleaning the house.
LEADFEMALE:It's free music, Miles.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd think you'd like that.
SUPFEMALE:God forbid we get into an elevator where there's Muzak.
LEADFEMALE:You've made your point.
SUPFEMALE:I hum.
LEADMALE:Boy, do you hum! Listen, Scrooge.
LEADFEMALE:Scrooge? This is wonderful, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:We've reached a new point in our relationship.
LEADMALE:Total honesty.
SUPMALE:Look at us, Rose.
SUPMALE:We're two old people totally committed to each other, faults and all.
LEADMALE:You're right, Miles.
LEADFEMALE:If you consider humming a fault.
LEADFEMALE:Madam, your trout.
LEADMALE:Sir, your water.
LEADFEMALE:Just a moment, young man.
SUPMALE:This is a special night, and I have decided to treat myself.
LEADMALE:Just take this water away and bring me an iced tea.
SUPFEMALE:Look who's home! Dorothy! Well, how was your cruise? Oh, honey, it was fabulous.
LEADMALE:Oh, Lee was absolutely charming.
LEADMALE:We danced, we swam, the captain let me steer the boat.
LEADMALE:Oh, there was a casino on board.
LEADMALE:I lost four dollars, but I didn't care.
SUPMALE:Where's Ma? The captain let you steer? Well, you know, just for a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Where's Ma? Did he let you wear his hat? Rose, where's Ma? Dorothy, I'm talking to you! Did the captain let you wear his hat? Rose, there's something wrong, isn't there? Dorothy, sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Something happened to Ma.
LEADFEMALE:I know something happened to Ma.
LEADFEMALE:I leave for three days and something horrible has happened to Ma! Well, I'm back from my walk to the mailbox.
LEADFEMALE:Tomorrow, the corner.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma, thank God you're all right!  You've been with a man, haven't you? And it was heavenly.
LEADFEMALE:But before I tell you about my weekend, I want to hear all about yours.
SUPFEMALE:You're looking at it.
LEADMALE:All I did was sit.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche was all over me like a cheap slut.
OTHERFEMALE:I think you mean suit.
LEADFEMALE:Not necessarily.
LEADMALE:But you know, this proves something.
LEADFEMALE:Left to herself, Blanche is wild and self-absorbed.
LEADFEMALE:But give her a little responsibility, you know, a job to do, boy, she's right there for you.
LEADMALE:Where is she, anyway? Ouch, ouch.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Well, I do not believe it.
LEADMALE:I simply do not believe it.
OTHERMALE:What, Blanche? Oh, Dorothy, I just talked to somebody back home, and they are doin' the most horrible thing.
LEADMALE:They are tearin' down the most important building in Blanche Devereaux's family history.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God, they're tearing down Mattress World.
SUPMALE:Even worse than that.
LEADFEMALE:They are tearin' down the place where I spent my happiest moments as a child.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:They're tearing down Boys Town.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, they are tearin' down Grammy Hollingsworth's plantation.
LEADMALE:That beautiful old place is gonna be gone forever.
LEADMALE:I used to spend my summers there, and Christmas vacations.
LEADMALE:And whenever there was a fight in the house between Big Daddy and Big Mommy Big Mommy Gee, I don't think I ever knew her name before.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, I just don't believe you.
SUPFEMALE:When you were a child, didn't you have some beautiful, fantastic place where you'd go, and it would seem just like a fairyland? Oh, that's right.
LEADFEMALE:You grew up in Brooklyn.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Dorothy, hurry! It's Sophia.
LEADMALE:She's passed out! What? Oh! Oh, my God, Ma! I don't know what happened.
LEADMALE:I came in, she was choking.
LEADMALE:This isn't working.
LEADMALE:Dorothy? Dorothy? Where am I? 
OTHERFEMALE:Sophia.
LEADMALE:Welcome to heaven.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in heaven? That's right.
LEADFEMALE:"Heaven" heaven? I went straight to heaven? No stops? No purgatory? Purgatory?  Oh, you Catholics.
LEADMALE:Look, why don't you make yourself comfortable? I have to prepare for our next arrival, and actually, I'm rather excited.
SUPFEMALE:It's a televangelist.
LEADMALE:Why is that exciting? We've never had one here before.
LEADMALE:So this is heaven.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Sophia! Sophia! Hey, who's that? Who's calling me? It's me.
OTHERMALE:You know  Oh, Sal, is that you? Could it possibly be you? Oh, Sal, please prove to me it's you.
SUPFEMALE:You dirty rat.
LEADFEMALE:You killed my brother.
SUPMALE:Oh, Sal, it is you! You always did such a great Cagney.
SUPFEMALE:Sweetheart, how do you feel? How do I feel? I feel great.
LEADMALE:Hey, this is wonderful.
LEADMALE:My bunions don't hurt, my arthritis is gone, and my teeth Are teeth! Here, all the parts work.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I've missed you.
SUPFEMALE:And I missed you.
SUPFEMALE:I wish you knew how much.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not letting go.
SUPMALE:I'm never letting go.
LEADMALE:Come on, Rose! Come on! I'm trying! I'm trying! Well, try harder!  There you go, honey.
LEADMALE:There you go.
LEADMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Sal? Sal? Ma, are you okay? What happened? Oh, Ma, you were choking.
OTHERFEMALE:You passed out.
LEADMALE:Rose saved your life.
SUPMALE:But I was in heaven and with your father.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't want to come back.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for nothing, you nitwit.
LEADMALE:Ma, stop that.
LEADFEMALE:Rose did save your life.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, you were not in heaven.
LEADFEMALE:You were probably just dreaming.
OTHERMALE:Ma, stop that.
LEADFEMALE:You Rose did save your life.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, you were not in heaven.
LEADFEMALE:You were probably just dreaming.
SUPFEMALE:You don't believe me.
LEADMALE:Your father even sent a message.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure he did, but right now, you should calm down, Ma.
SUPMALE:We can talk about that later.
LEADMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:If you think that's best.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:So, anyway, Dorothy, like I was saying about Grammy's plantation Blanche, I cannot believe you! You said you weren't gonna talk about this till later.
LEADMALE:I know, but Ma almost died.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she's got her color back, hasn't she? Really, Blanche, what could be so important about a building? I will tell you what is so important.
LEADMALE:It was my home away from home as a child.
OTHERMALE:Especially my bedroom.
LEADFEMALE:Grammy and I would have all our late night talks up there.
SUPMALE:And now they're tearin' it down.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's terrible.
LEADMALE:My Grammy's plantation was the one place I consistently felt loved as a child.
LEADMALE:Now they're gonna put a steel ball through her house, through my room.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't you see? It's just like they're killin' a part of me.
SUPMALE:Oh, poor, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I I actually do feel sorry for her.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, my heart goes out to her, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, did I mention I died? Oh, hi, Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:Where you been? Out.
OTHERMALE:After yesterday, I decided to take the time and stop and smell the roses.
SUPMALE:Ah, that's nice, Ma.
LEADMALE:And you know where they have great roses? At the dog track in Lauderdale.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, your Bonneville shakes when you go over 65.
LEADMALE:Ma, you were driving? What is wrong with you? What, do you have some sort of a death wish? No, I have a life wish.
SUPMALE:I've seen the white light.
SUPFEMALE:Now that I know there's a place for me on the other side, I'm not gonna live in fear anymore.
LEADMALE:Pussycat, what's that on your blouse? See? I laugh in the face of death.
SUPMALE:Ma, stop it.
SUPMALE:I don't want to hear about this dream that is making you act reckless.
SUPMALE:The doctor says it was a lack of oxygen that made you hallucinate.
LEADMALE:All right, I won't tell you what your father said.
OTHERFEMALE:I won't say another word.
LEADMALE:The light! The light! I'm coming to you, Salie! Ma, enough with the white light.
LEADFEMALE:You are making me crazy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm off to Atlanta.
LEADFEMALE:You're going where? To Grammy's plantation.
LEADFEMALE:I have to see it one more time.
LEADFEMALE:Sweetheart, wouldn't it better to just let go? But I can't.
LEADMALE:It was hard enough lettin' go when Grammy died.
LEADMALE:The family had to sell Grand View, and it got turned into an old bed and breakfast.
SUPFEMALE:But at least I could visit.
SUPFEMALE:And have breakfast.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Pancakes, by the looks of it.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Honey, you know we'd go with you if it would help, but by tomorrow, Grand View will be gone.
LEADMALE:And we'd have to drive all night and stop at a motel, and we all know how you hate to drive.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I found a way around that.
SUPMALE:Hey, Blanche, I figured out this treasure map.
OTHERFEMALE:It's buried somewhere outside Atlanta.
SUPMALE:Let's roll.
SUPMALE:
SUPMALE:Let's try it now with Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, Dorothy, bo-borthy Bonana fanna fo-forthy Fee, fy, mo-morthy  
LEADMALE:Get out, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:This is it, Grand View.
OTHERMALE:Wow, I've never been to the Deep South before.
SUPMALE:Well, let's go back.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, I still cannot believe what you were doing on the interstate.
LEADMALE:I was living for the day, pussycat.
SUPFEMALE:You were mooning a chain gang! And did you see the smiles on their faces? They probably hadn't seen a woman in years.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess not.
SUPFEMALE:No, they kept up with us through four warning shots.
SUPMALE:Oh, Blanche, you must have so many memories here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, are you kidding? I cannot tell you how many Christmases I spent in this place.
LEADFEMALE:Grammy's butler would bring us our eggnog by the hearth, and Grammy and I would sing carols and put out gingerbread men for St.
LEADMALE:Nick and Oh, and over there would be Grandpappy, drinkin' out of his jug with the X's on it, and wearin' his Santa's beard, and just screamin' at the lawn jockey to do him a little dance.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Rose, hold me.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Can I help you folks? Uh, look, excuse me, you don't-- you don't really know me.
OTHERFEMALE:My name is Blanche Devereaux.
SUPMALE:My family used to live here, and I would very much like to see my old bedroom.
SUPFEMALE:It's Room 7.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, please, we came all the way from Miami.
LEADMALE:Okay, but you better be quick about it.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna blow this place up in two hours.
SUPFEMALE:I get to push the plunger, 'cause it's my birthday.
LEADFEMALE:Well, happy birthday.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Come on, girls.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me, sir, but I died yesterday, and it occurs to me I never experienced Southern food.
LEADFEMALE:So send a possum to Room 7.
LEADFEMALE:And tell my daughter it's chicken.
LEADFEMALE:And Grammy's wind chimes.
LEADMALE:Oh, she loved wind chimes.
SUPMALE:Had them in every room.
LEADMALE:And my balcony.
LEADMALE:Oh, I remember as a girl of 10, I used to wander out here, and all the little boys from all around would come and serenade me.
LEADFEMALE:I see London, I see France I see Blanche's underpants Rose, hold me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, please.
LEADMALE:Now, honey, I know it's hard, but we've been here over an hour.
SUPFEMALE:And you've shown us the balcony, you've shown us the wind chimes, you've shown us the seven places you lost your virginity.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, please, it's getting late.
LEADMALE:Dorothy's right.
LEADFEMALE:You really have had a chance to say goodbye.
LEADMALE:But I can't.
SUPFEMALE:I can't say goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dorothy, I--I know that there's somethin' I haven't told you about this room.
OTHERMALE:Somethin' I haven't said, because I was afraid you'd think I was weird.
SUPFEMALE:My Grammy, she's in this room.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, man, cool.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, come on.
LEADFEMALE:You only think she's here.
SUPMALE:You and Grammy spent a lot of time here, and the memories are so alive.
LEADFEMALE:Of course you can You can almost feel her here.
SUPFEMALE:Right, Rose? Well, she's not under the bed.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, I know it sounds odd, but this is the room where Grammy and I used to have all of our heart-to-hearts.
OTHERMALE:I would snuggle up in one of her homemade afghans, and whatever problems I had in life, she would make right.
LEADFEMALE:And then after she died, she started coming to me here, and the talks didn't stop.
SUPMALE:And she's not in the closet.
SUPMALE:Okay, folks, that's it.
SUPMALE:Get out or get blown up.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, all of my life she's been helpin' me! All of my life! And I just don't know what I would do without her.
LEADMALE:Blanche, what are you doing? If they're gonna blow this place up, they're gonna do it with me in it.
LEADMALE:Oh, now, come on.
LEADMALE:Blanche, this is ridiculous.
LEADMALE:You can't stay here all night.
LEADMALE:You're gonna have to eat sometime.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, this is where you don't know me, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I can go for days without food, if that's what it takes.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:You've been known to debone a chicken from across the room.
OTHERMALE:You know, Blanche, when my father died, I heard his voice, too, or what I thought was his voice.
SUPMALE:Honey, it happens to everybody.
SUPMALE:It's wishful thinking.
SUPMALE:We want to hear them, so we do.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't believe that Grammy's here, that she talks to me.
SUPMALE:Of course I do, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, this is your Grammy.
LEADMALE:Y'all get yourself out of here, you dumb peckerwood.
SUPMALE:Oh, I heard it that time, too.
SUPMALE:Feets, don't fail me now! How dare you mock my Grammy? Oh, Blanche, honey, you've lost the battle, but at least you can still come here and visit the grounds.
LEADFEMALE:It won't be the same.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, they're gonna build a cheap motel here.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll be back.
SUPFEMALE:And you can look at these magnificent magnolias, and stroll that beautiful hillside and Ma? Ma, what the hell are you doing on the roof? 
LEADFEMALE:Living for the day, pussycat.
LEADMALE:I never jumped into a haystack before.
LEADFEMALE:Ma! Geronimo! My God! Dorothy, is she okay? Yeah, I think so.
LEADMALE:Rose broke her fall.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, are you okay? 
LEADFEMALE:Charlie? Charlie, is that you? Great, another one who hears voices.
LEADMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:I've had it.
LEADMALE:My mother is impossible.
LEADFEMALE:You are impossible.
OTHERMALE:You can just rot here for all I care.
SUPFEMALE:I do wish you would give me the benefit of the doubt.
LEADFEMALE:Why can't you give me the benefit of logic? Look, Blanche, I'm not saying you're crazy, but places, smells, sounds, they're all very powerful suggestions.
SUPMALE:I mean, isn't it possible this is all your imagination, Blanche?  Blanche? Fine.
SUPMALE:How long do you think you can stay handcuffed? My personal best is 32 hours.
OTHERFEMALE:But of course, then I had somebody to play with.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I want to be here when the dynamite goes off.
LEADFEMALE:I want to ride the rocket with you.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, I just wonder if maybe Dorothy's right.
OTHERFEMALE:Could this whole Grammy thing be somethin' I just talked myself into believing? Some kind of childhood nonsense? Dorothy doesn't understand about these things.
LEADMALE:You know, her father sent her a very special message, and she doesn't even want me to tell her about it.
OTHERMALE:You can tell me about it, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Oh, yes, I'd love to hear it.
SUPMALE:Picture it.
LEADMALE:Heaven.
LEADMALE:Two days ago.
LEADFEMALE:I'm holding onto Sal, telling him I'll never let go, when who shows up  Uh-oh.
SUPMALE:What is it? What's going on? You're not gonna believe this, Sophia, but God, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Sophia, God.
OTHERMALE:Wow, now I see where Jesus got those eyes.
LEADFEMALE:He's talking.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yes, I understand, God.
LEADFEMALE:I know these things happen.
SUPFEMALE:What? Well, if you want.
LEADMALE:You dirty rat.
OTHERFEMALE:Sal, you look so sad.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong? God says it's not your time yet.
OTHERMALE:You gotta go back, Sophia.
LEADMALE:But I wanna be with you.
LEADFEMALE:I don't wanna go back.
LEADFEMALE:He pretty much gets his way in these things.
LEADMALE:Besides, someone's got to take care of little spumoni-face.
LEADFEMALE:Who? Dorothy.
LEADMALE:When I worked late, I'd come home, we had our little secret ice cream club, and that was the nickname I gave her.
LEADMALE:And what was her nickname for you? Favorite parent.
SUPFEMALE:It's time, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Do I have to? Don't be so sad.
LEADFEMALE:We'll be together again.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, Sal.
OTHERFEMALE:And I love you.
LEADFEMALE:And tell my little spumoni-face something.
LEADMALE:I'm proud of her.
LEADMALE:You're right, Blanche, these naked Southern guys sure can dance.
LEADMALE:I don't think she's coming down, Rose.
OTHERMALE:You know, I have a good mind to just strand her here.
LEADMALE:Can you believe that woman? Hey, Dorothy, have you seen this yet? B.
SUPMALE:H.
LEADMALE:? B.
SUPMALE:H.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche Hollingsworth.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Blanche must have written this when she was a little girl.
SUPFEMALE:Can you imagine Blanche as a little girl, running and skipping all through this house, so carefree? I can almost hear her laughing.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I I can almost feel her spirit here.
LEADMALE:And if I can feel her spirit here, then why is it so ridiculous that Blanche feels the spirit of her grandma upstairs? And is it such a leap of faith to believe that Ma was in the white light? I mean, why am I making it such a crusade not to believe either one of them? What am I, just an ostrich with its head in the ground? A narrow-minded ostrich, who Who only believes what she can see and feel and touch? Oh, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Simple Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, you are so wise.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, I spoke with the demolitions guy.
LEADMALE:B.
SUPMALE:H.
LEADFEMALE:stands for "Blast here.
SUPFEMALE:" Okay, boys, upstairs we go.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:What the hell do you think you're doing? Now look, I'm a patient man, but your friend is trespassing, and I'm having her hauled out of here.
LEADMALE:Let's go, boys.
SUPMALE:You hold it! I'm not gonna let you do this.
LEADMALE:Blanche is in a very fragile state up there.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be damned if I'm gonna let you treat her like a common criminal.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, it's all right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm-- I'm coming down.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:You're out.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, what happened? What changed your mind? Grammy came.
LEADMALE:She told me it was time.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you okay, honey? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:We had a wonderful visit.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, excuse me, sir, but do you mind if I take a souvenir? Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:You got a lot of sweet memories here.
SUPFEMALE:I had a Grammy once, myself.
LEADMALE:Okay, boys, let's go celebrate my birthday.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, you need a minute to say goodbye? Thanks.
SUPMALE:beer on the wall Three bottles of beer on the wall Three bottles of beer Take one down, pass it around Two bottles of beer on the wall Well, I'm off to bed.
LEADMALE:"Two bottles of beer"? Rose, you get all the way to two bottles of beer and you quit? Just drives you nuts, doesn't it, Dorothy? Oh, what a wonderful ride home.
LEADMALE:I bet there must've been a million stars up in the sky.
SUPFEMALE:And I got to spend it all with my friends.
LEADFEMALE:Well, good night.
SUPMALE:Well, whatever happened up in that room sure did her a world of good.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me? Well, it's just that I've I've never seen her like this.
LEADFEMALE:She must have had a really great experience.
SUPMALE:Oh, Blanche has a great experience, but your mother is a nut.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, I never said that.
LEADFEMALE:Then why won't you talk to me about the white light? It scares me, all right? It makes me feel like you're embracing death, and I don't want to see that.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to rail against it, Ma.
LEADMALE:I said I wasn't scared of dying anymore.
LEADMALE:I didn't say I was ready to die.
SUPMALE:Look, Dorothy, you don't have to believe all of this, but stop trying to take it away from me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to bed.
LEADMALE:Good night, spumoni-face.
OTHERFEMALE:What did you call me? Spumoni-face.
SUPFEMALE:Wow.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I I haven't heard that since I was seven years old.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ma, come on, this is crazy.
LEADMALE:I probably told you sometime and just forgot.
OTHERFEMALE:He says he's proud of you, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Ma, I just don't understand all this.
SUPMALE:I mean, maybe there is a whole lot I don't know.
SUPMALE:Supernatural things, hard-to-believe strange things that That do happen.
LEADFEMALE:Probably more than any of us knows.
LEADFEMALE:What do you say we throw a sheet over our heads and go scare Rose? Right!  Good night, Grammy.
SUPFEMALE: It's time to sleep, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Some of us are still alive and need our beauty sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Be quiet, Grammy!
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:I, Sophia Petrillo, being of sound mind and body, do hereby leave my daughter, Dorothy Zbornak, nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia! It's a joke.
LEADFEMALE:I'm kidding.
SUPMALE:Like when I said "sound mind and body.
LEADMALE:" Sophia, wills are no joking matter.
LEADFEMALE:Charlie tried to be funny with his and left everything to Henrietta, our prized cow.
LEADFEMALE:Well, some lawyer got a hold of the will and represented Henrietta on contingency.
SUPFEMALE:There I was presenting my side to a jury of her peers.
LEADMALE:It took over six months to get the farm back.
LEADFEMALE:What a terrible story.
LEADFEMALE:I mean it.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a terrible story.
SUPMALE:But you must have been relieved when you won.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:We celebrated with a big, thick steak.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, guys.
SUPMALE:Oh, Dorothy, I'm glad you're here.
SUPMALE:Sit down.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh? What is it, Ma? As you know, my child, I'm getting on in years and I've decided it's time for me to settle my estate.
LEADMALE:What estate? Your loofah sponge and bus pass? Don't forget the four gold teeth when your father worked at the funeral parlor.
LEADFEMALE:"Perks," he called them.
SUPFEMALE:That's the stock you come from.
SUPFEMALE:I come from grave robbers? Grave robber, entrepreneur.
SUPMALE:Potato, potahto.
OTHERFEMALE:We had a family to feed.
LEADMALE:I hated that cow.
LEADMALE:I still don't think she should have been awarded the car.
LEADMALE:Not that she got to use it.
LEADFEMALE:Butt out.
LEADFEMALE:I'm having an important moment with my heir.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, Rose is helping me make out an ironclad will.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, you're using Rose as a lawyer? I know what I'm doing.
OTHERFEMALE:Every Thursday, I watch La Law.
LEADFEMALE:That's L.
SUPFEMALE:A.
LEADMALE:Law.
LEADMALE:I wondered why Susan Dey didn't have a French accent.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, what am I gonna do? I got a call from a soldier who just returned from the Persian Gulf.
LEADMALE:Don't fall for it, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Sal didn't come home from World War II till 1951.
LEADFEMALE:Where was he stationed? In the attic.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you told me he was in the arctic.
SUPMALE:The attic, the arctic.
SUPFEMALE:Tomato, tomahto.
LEADFEMALE:He had a family to feed.
LEADMALE:Well, anyway, this soldier really did go to the war, and he's gonna be here any minute, and I don't know what to do 'cause I can't remember him.
LEADMALE:All he said on the phone was that he had a great time with me the night before he left.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, then it's got to beanybody.
SUPMALE:Ah, there's your unknown soldier now.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dorothy, would you please get the door? And find out his name.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, what are you so worried about? The minute you see him, you'll remember.
LEADMALE:Rose, he's gonna be standin' up with his clothes on.
LEADMALE:He could be Anybody.
LEADMALE:Please, Dorothy? Oh, all right.
SUPMALE:Can I come? Sure, Ma.
LEADMALE:Oh, boy.
SUPFEMALE:We're going to the living room.
SUPMALE:We don't have much of a life, do we, Dorothy? Dorothy? Dorothy? Now remember, be nice to him.
LEADMALE:He hasn't had sex in over a year.
LEADFEMALE:Look who I'm talkin' to.
LEADMALE:Hello, is Blanche here? Yes, she is.
SUPMALE:Uh, whom shall I say is calling? This is kind of embarrassing.
OTHERFEMALE:Would you mind telling her Loverboy is here? Nothing would give me greater pleasure.
SUPMALE:Uh, Blanche, Loverboy is here.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche! Loverboy! Not a clue.
LEADMALE:I just got off the plane.
SUPMALE:I haven't even been home yet.
SUPFEMALE:I just couldn't wait to see you, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Loverboy.
OTHERFEMALE:That's-- That's so sweet, Loverboy.
LEADMALE:All those months away I kept saying, "There's a great lady waiting for you back home, Ken.
SUPFEMALE:" Ken! That's it.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, Ken.
LEADMALE:Then Ken would turn to me and say, "There's a great lady waiting for you, too, Bill.
LEADFEMALE:" "Bill"? Bill, he was talking to you, right? Yes.
LEADMALE:Yes, of course.
SUPFEMALE:Darlings, this is Bill.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess Bill and I should be going.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we should go back to that same place where we fell in love, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Yes, that's great.
LEADFEMALE:That'd be wonderful.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:We'll go right back tothere.
LEADFEMALE:We'll just do exactly the same things we did that night.
LEADMALE:Oh, what a wonderful night that was.
SUPFEMALE:Bye, girls.
SUPFEMALE:Not a clue.
SUPMALE:Isn't this something, Blanche? Do you believe they gave us the same table? Well, why would they seat us separately? I mean, the same table as last time.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, of course.
OTHERMALE:Silly me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and look, even the same chairs.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I have a confession to make.
SUPFEMALE:It's not easy.
LEADMALE:But something happened over there and I think you should know about it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I did keep pretty well up with what went on over there.
SUPMALE:I saw Schwarzkopf on the Bob Hope special.
LEADMALE:What I'm talking about is personal, Blanche.
SUPMALE:I know we said we wouldn't even look at anybody else.
LEADMALE:But the first night the sirens went off, I got scared.
LEADFEMALE:And there was this nurse that I talked to.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, how could you, Ben, Bob, uh, Bill? I swear, it didn't mean a thing.
SUPMALE:Was she beautiful? Not as beautiful as you.
SUPMALE:Well, I--I, too, have a confession to make.
LEADFEMALE:I got scared, too.
LEADMALE:Three, four times a week.
SUPFEMALE:Depending upon how often the phone rang.
OTHERMALE:You were scared they were calling about me, weren't you, Blanche? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's it.
LEADFEMALE:That's a good one.
OTHERMALE:Well, if it weren't for your picture, I don't think I'd have made it through.
SUPFEMALE:My picture? You know, it sounds corny, but I put your picture in my locker, and I would look at it every day.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know how important it is to know that you've got somebody back home, especially when you're thousands of miles away in the middle of a war.
LEADFEMALE:You promised me when I came back, I would be your one and only guy.
OTHERMALE:Dance? Sure.
LEADMALE:Welcome home, soldier.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, it's late.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing up? I'm just cleaning up some things on your mother's will.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you mean the legal language? No.
OTHERMALE:I spilled some sauce.
LEADMALE:Ma, what are you doing up? Disappointed, huh? If I'm up that means I'm alive, and if I'm alive, it means you can't get your hands on my money.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? You know about the will.
LEADFEMALE:You know if I die you'll be on easy street.
LEADFEMALE:What did you do, Dorothy, slip cyanide into my mouthwash? Ha, ha! The joke's on you, I don't use it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Ma, come on.
LEADMALE:You're just being silly.
LEADFEMALE:Here, have some tea.
LEADFEMALE:It'll relax you.
LEADMALE:Nice try, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Rose, you taste it.
LEADMALE:Rose, don't! That tea was for my mommy.
SUPMALE:You try to do right by your kids and you end up as the lead story on Hard Copy.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have any idea what she's talking about, or do we have to up her medication? I do know what she's talking about, but I can't tell you.
LEADMALE:I couldn't violate the attorney-client privilege.
LEADMALE:Especially when we're talking about a sum as large as $35,000.
LEADMALE:"$35,000"? And four gold teeth.
OTHERMALE:Oops.
LEADFEMALE:Nice going, counselor.
LEADFEMALE:Exactly how close to the television are you sitting when you're watching La Law? All right, Ma, enough.
LEADMALE:Now, where did you get $35,000? Did you ever hear of hard work? Well, your brother and sister had to work very hard to send me that money.
LEADFEMALE:Are you telling me that all these years you were hoarding money while I had to make big, huge sacrifices? I'm not telling you, you're guessing.
LEADFEMALE:But to be perfectly honest, you're getting warmer.
SUPMALE:Oh, what a wonderful night.
OTHERFEMALE:Now that Bill's getting out of the service, we can build a life together.
LEADMALE:Maybe with a VA loan we can get a nice little house in the country with a dog, a cat, a station wagon.
LEADMALE:Blanche, you're talking like it's 1945.
SUPMALE:These aren't the best years of your life, these are the last years of your life.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, tonight, when I was dancing in his arms, it hit me.
OTHERFEMALE:One minute I was worried about my hair, the next I was in love.
OTHERFEMALE:Bill is the most romantic man I've ever known.
LEADFEMALE:She always says that when they give her a hat.
SUPFEMALE:Good morning, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Don't start, Rose, okay? Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:That good morning crack was way out of line.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, it's me.
SUPMALE:I was up all night thinking of how Ma's been hoarding all those checks from Phil and Gloria, while I've had to go without.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now, Dorothy, you really can't blame Sophia for your sex life.
LEADMALE:That's not what I'm talking about, but since you brought it up, yes, I can.
LEADFEMALE:If I'd had the money, I could have been living in a swinging condo, instead of with I better not say anything till I've had my coffee.
SUPFEMALE:A slut and a moron.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, it must be decaf.
LEADMALE:Good morning, pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:Huh? What's so "pussycat" about it? Do you have any idea of how furious I am with you? All these years I have given up things so that you could have a decent life.
SUPMALE:"No, Ma, I don't need new shoes, I want you to play bingo.
SUPFEMALE:"No, Ma, I don't need that vacation, you need new wallpaper.
SUPMALE:"My car will last another year" All right, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:I see behind that mask.
LEADMALE:You're angry.
LEADFEMALE:You're damn right, I'm angry.
LEADMALE:You've been hoarding money for the last 10 years and taking advantage of me.
OTHERMALE:Of course I'm angry.
SUPMALE:No, it's something else.
SUPFEMALE:I think you didn't get enough hugs when you were a kid.
SUPFEMALE:It's payback time.
LEADMALE:Come here, pussycat.
SUPMALE:Why don't you hug your money, Ma? From now on, I'm not paying for anything.
LEADFEMALE:You are on your own.
LEADMALE:You can't do this to me.
LEADMALE:You never touch the principal.
SUPMALE:That money's for my old age.
LEADFEMALE:"Old age"? You don't leave fingerprints anymore.
SUPFEMALE:I'm in my twilight years.
SUPFEMALE:You're in the Twilight Zone.
LEADFEMALE:Hopi Indians are walking around saying, "How does she do it?" Ma, you're cut off.
OTHERFEMALE:I had to see you this morning.
LEADFEMALE:I just couldn't go to the drugstore without giving you this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, why, thank you.
SUPMALE:Why--Why are you going to the drugstore? I'm your pharmacist.
LEADFEMALE:You're Bill.
LEADFEMALE:Bill, the pharmacist.
LEADFEMALE:Bill, the man in your life.
OTHERMALE:I'll pick you up after work.
SUPFEMALE:Goodbye, my love.
LEADFEMALE:Girls! Blanche, what's wrong? My handsome soldier from last night is a pharmacist, a name-tag wearing, pill-counting, "Thank you, come again.
SUPMALE:"Sorry, we don't validate," pharmacist.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if he doesn't validate, get rid of him.
LEADMALE:Yeah, dump him like you do all the rest.
LEADMALE:Well, ordinarily, I would, but how--how can I do that? He's-- He's been dreaming of me for over a year.
SUPFEMALE:And I care about him.
SUPMALE:I mean, I care about him when he's a soldier.
LEADMALE:Oh, I said things to him last night, I've never said to anybody.
LEADMALE:Clean things.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, I can't dump this man.
LEADFEMALE:Not after what I've meant to him.
LEADFEMALE:Not after what he's done for his country.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, how do you think this sounds? "Dear Bill, I always promised my father, Big Daddy, "that I would never get serious about anybody "he didn't approve of.
SUPFEMALE:Since he is dead, I feel" Oh, for God's sake, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Well, I guess I could always tell him that he's too good for me.
LEADMALE:Sometimes the truth is best.
LEADFEMALE:Here you go.
OTHERFEMALE:Half butter pecan, half rocky road.
SUPMALE:Just like you like it, ma'am.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Oh, here, darling, that's for you.
LEADMALE:Wow, a whole dollar.
OTHERFEMALE:Now I can buy those knee-highs I've been saving up for.
LEADMALE:Let me know if you have any more work, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Well, I may want you to take this letter down to the pharmacy and give it to Bill.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, you're not gonna send that letter.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, that's so cold.
LEADMALE:Don't you think you owe him a face-to-face explanation? Good job, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Cut off what little income I've got.
SUPMALE:Blanche, instead of sending the letter, why don't you talk to him? I mean, get to know him.
OTHERFEMALE:Find out where this goes.
SUPMALE:You know, ever since we've known you, you have never once worked on having a meaningful relationship.
SUPFEMALE:I have had many meaningful relationships.
LEADMALE:Many, many, many meaningful relationships.
LEADMALE:Sharing a worm from a tequila bottle is not meaningful.
SUPFEMALE:No, you find one little flaw in somebody, and you run away.
OTHERMALE:"A little flaw"? He has skinny arms.
LEADMALE:How'd you like to be made love to by somebody who has arms like your mother? My father made love to her because of her inner beauty.
SUPMALE:He never saw me naked.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, Dorothy, maybe you're right.
SUPMALE:I should try to make this relationship work.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, I'm gonna go get prettied up and then I'm going down to the drugstore and--and get to know more about this man.
SUPMALE:You know, Bill's likes, Bill's dislikes, Bill's last name.
LEADFEMALE:I used to put the Haley's M-O on the bottom, nothing.
SUPMALE:Then I put it eye level.
LEADMALE:The public went nuts.
LEADFEMALE:It was walking out of the store.
OTHERFEMALE:People will bend for aspirins.
OTHERMALE:They won't bend for laxatives.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that fascinating, Bill.
SUPMALE:So, Bill, what's on sale? Breast pumps.
SUPMALE:What else? Afro Sheen.
LEADFEMALE:Moving on.
SUPFEMALE:Preparation H.
SUPFEMALE:Hot damn.
LEADMALE:Isn't she awful? So, Bill, what other exciting things can you tell me about the drugstore business? Blanche, we gotta talk.
LEADFEMALE:You know the laxative thing? Mmm-hmm.
SUPFEMALE:That's about as exciting as it gets.
SUPMALE:This place, my job, it's pretty routine.
OTHERMALE:Oh, what are you talking about? You're a hero.
SUPFEMALE:Over there.
LEADMALE:Over here, I'm just an ordinary guy.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:You give your son this every four hours, and if his fever doesn't go down, you take him to see el doctor Seigal at 11th and Lincoln.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, who says you're not a hero? Welcome home.
SUPMALE:It is home, isn't it? Last night I wasn't quite here yet.
SUPMALE:This morning was real.
LEADMALE:When I handed you that rose, I realized I was standing at a stranger's door.
SUPMALE:Because the truth is, I'm not a soldier.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a pharmacist in his 50s, and you're a woman in her Watch it, Bill.
LEADFEMALE:You're a woman in the prime of her life, who I would like to get to know better.
LEADFEMALE:Slowly.
LEADMALE:And we can both see other people? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Aw! Oh, sir? Mmm? I caught this old lady assaulting a man over the last tube of Preparation H.
LEADFEMALE:The tube broke and it's all over aisle 7.
OTHERFEMALE:I detained her for scooping up the rest of the ointment and putting it in her purse.
SUPMALE:Sophia! Oh, big deal.
OTHERFEMALE:The other guy got away scot-free, and he wriggled in it.
OTHERMALE:Uh, Ma, I bought you a little something.
LEADMALE:You what? I bought you a new handbag to replace the one that you ruined at the drugstore.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank God.
LEADMALE:The other one shrank down to the size of a change purse.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:What's the catch? Ma, there's no catch.
OTHERFEMALE:I just realized I like taking care of you.
LEADMALE:I just wish you could have told me about the money, so we could be honest with each other.
OTHERMALE:It's not that I want the money.
LEADMALE:If I don't leave my children anything, I'm a nobody.
LEADFEMALE:How many times have I heard, "He provided well," or, "She didn't leave a dime"? I want you to be able to have everything you want when I'm gone.
LEADFEMALE:And when you do, you'll think, "I have this because of Ma.
OTHERMALE:" Oh, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Life isn't just valued by the money you leave.
LEADMALE:It's-- It's the memories.
LEADMALE:The love.
LEADFEMALE:And you filled my life with that.
OTHERFEMALE:You're right, pussycat.
SUPMALE:And I should want to see you enjoy some of that money while I'm still around.
LEADFEMALE:Here's a molar.
LEADFEMALE:Buy yourself something pretty.
LEADFEMALE:That is so sweet.
LEADMALE:Ma, I tell you what.
OTHERMALE:Let me make you a cup of tea.
LEADFEMALE:I, Sophia Petrillo, when I die, wanna be blown to a million, billion bits.
LEADFEMALE:I, Sophia Petrillo, leave my daughter to science.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Good mornin'.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, how was your date last night? Oh, it's too soon to tell.
LEADMALE:I'll let you know when I send him home.
OTHERMALE:Is this for Rose's birthday? Oh, now, look, don't you start with me.
LEADFEMALE:Every Christmas, every birthday, any time we have to give a gift to the same person, you always find something wrong with mine so yours looks better.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't say anything.
LEADFEMALE:But let's face it, those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.
LEADFEMALE:Look at the ducky wrappin' paper.
LEADMALE:And the little stick-on bow.
SUPFEMALE:Did you get her a Ziggy card? No.
LEADMALE:Oh, my.
OTHERMALE:Not Snoopy? I didn't get her a card.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, if you're really so worried about this, well, I'll just let Rose open yours first so you won't be embarrassed.
LEADMALE:You know, your ego is so fragile you have to turn everything into a popularity contest.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I have news for you.
LEADMALE:Today your worst nightmare happens.
OTHERFEMALE:Today I make you look bad.
SUPMALE:You hate me 'cause I'm beautiful, don't you? There's a man leaving in 10 minutes.
SUPFEMALE:Be under him.
LEADMALE:Coming through.
LEADFEMALE:The Pope's in town and I've got a bus to catch.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see, I've got my binoculars, my lucky rosary Uh-oh, I forgot my whoopee cushion.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, who am I kidding? Everyone on that bus will be over 80.
LEADMALE:It'd be like getting a dog to bark in a kennel.
OTHERMALE:What are you talkin' about, Sophia? Oh, the Pope is saying a mass on his stopover here.
LEADFEMALE:Ma got two tickets.
SUPMALE:We're going together.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, a papal mass is something people wait a lifetime for.
LEADMALE:Whoops.
SUPMALE:"Whoops"? Is that Pope-related, or just another bark in the kennel? The Pope.
SUPFEMALE:I traded our two bad tickets way in the back for one good ticket way up front.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Ma, what about me? Uh, I thought about that.
SUPMALE:This is the plan.
LEADMALE:We'll get one of those really long overcoats, I'll stand on your shoulders, and And what? Blend in with the circus folk? Dorothy, I need to get close to the Pope so I can ask him to come and bless my friend Agnes in the hospital.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, now, isn't that sweet? But, honey, with all those people, there's no way you're ever going to get the Pope to notice you.
LEADMALE:Oh, he'll notice me.
LEADMALE:I'm home.
SUPMALE:Oh, Rose, happy birthday, honey! Oh, thanks so much, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:An even happier birthday from me.
LEADMALE:You're hurting me, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:Honey, before you do anything else I want you to open my gift.
LEADMALE:I think you're gonna like it.
OTHERMALE:Oh, isn't that pretty.
SUPMALE:Oh, Dorothy! Oh, a second-hand sweatshirt with my name misspelled on it.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're right, Dorothy, I love it! Rose, that is the original Mickey Mouse Club sweatshirt that Roy wore! I got it at an auction.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:I loved Roy.
OTHERMALE:Oh, there was something about him.
SUPFEMALE:Woof! Oh, Dorothy, I just can't imagine a better birthday present.
SUPFEMALE:Neither can I.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche? Rose, before I give you mine, I just want to ask you one question.
SUPMALE:It may seem a little odd, but it has a lot to do with your gift.
LEADMALE:Has Miles started wearing bikini underwear lately? Blanche, please, the Pope is in town.
SUPMALE:I'm serious.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, Miles did buy some bikinis.
SUPMALE:But just the bottoms.
SUPFEMALE:I have been watching Miles for a while, and I think he's going through a crisis.
LEADMALE:He is showing all the signs.
SUPFEMALE:Trying to act trendy, trying to be young.
SUPFEMALE:And if he's also wearing bikinis Just the bottoms.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm-hmm.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, Rose, I'm afraid he may start playin' around on you.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:None of this proves that Miles is even thinking of cheating on Rose.
LEADFEMALE:You're absolutely right, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:And that is why I have hired a detective to follow Miles and find out for sure! Happy birthday, honey! A detective? You're giving the gift of suspicion? That's right.
SUPFEMALE:He's gonna follow Miles everywhere he goes for the next two weeks.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, and if you really love any of the pictures, you can get 'em in wallet size.
LEADMALE:Well, I can't use this.
LEADFEMALE:She's right.
SUPMALE:This violates the privacy of her relationship, and I think you should take it back.
SUPMALE:You're just trying to make that old stupid sweatshirt of yours look better.
LEADMALE:Besides I can't take it back.
OTHERFEMALE:I paid in advance.
OTHERFEMALE:Can't you get a refund? Well, no.
LEADMALE:I paid with nature's credit card.
OTHERMALE:You never leave home without it.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, I'm not sure.
LEADFEMALE:Miles has never given me the slightest reason to distrust him.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, he was in the Witness Protection Program.
SUPMALE:He lied about his job, his past, his name.
OTHERMALE:Everything! Well, it is already paid for.
SUPFEMALE:We're going out now! Outside on the lanai! Uh, yes! Yes, here we are!  We're probably gonna sit in these chairs.
LEADFEMALE:Rose? Why did we do that? Did it seem odd to you? Well, well, yes, a little.
LEADFEMALE:But, hey, you're the birthday girl.
LEADMALE:Hey, I got an idea.
OTHERMALE:I'm-- I'm feeling a little frisky.
SUPFEMALE:Did you ever make love in the out-of-doors? Miles, no.
SUPFEMALE:Well, just once.
LEADFEMALE:Charlie and I went to St.
OTHERFEMALE:Olaf's most romantic outdoor trysting place.
LEADFEMALE:Mount Pushover.
LEADMALE:But that place was sacred.
LEADFEMALE:Not out here, Miles.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, Rose.
SUPMALE:I mean, it's not like anybody would be watching us.
OTHERFEMALE:But the others are just inside.
LEADMALE:Yeah, they're right inside.
LEADFEMALE:That's what makes it exciting.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, live for the day, hmm? Miles, there's a detective in the bushes.
LEADFEMALE:A detective A detective in the bushes! Oh, that's-- that's perfect, and--and you make believe you're the farmer's daughter hanging clothes on the line, see? Oh, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Places, everybody! Miles! No, no, no, make up a detective name.
LEADFEMALE:No, Miles, there is a detective in the bushes.
SUPMALE:Come on out! Right now! 
LEADMALE:I'm not really supposed to let you see me.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:It's like a rule.
LEADFEMALE:Out!  Sorry.
LEADMALE:Rose, what is going on here? Blanche gave me a detective for my birthday.
LEADMALE:How you doing? She was afraid you might be cheating on me.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh, I see.
LEADMALE:Well, Blanche is a good friend.
LEADFEMALE:I suppose Well, I suppose she was just looking out for you.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm so glad you're not mad at her.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not.
SUPFEMALE:I'm mad at you! Hey, as long as it's your birthday, how about I get one of the two of you together, huh? Do you mind? Me? Why are you mad at me? Oh, Rose, you should have known you could trust me.
SUPMALE:This is an insult to me and our whole relationship! Miles? Miles!  Miles, big news Later.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, I've got I'm busy, Sophia.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, I can't breathe! Not now, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, but this better be good.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:How good would you consider the Pope's ring? Okay, Ma, squirt me in the eye and get it over with.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:This is his ring.
LEADMALE:Look.
OTHERFEMALE:My God, Ma! This looks real! It is real.
LEADFEMALE:You think he'd wear his fakes in public like Zsa Zsa? But, Ma, how did this happen? Picture it.
SUPMALE:The papal mass.
LEADMALE:A few hours ago.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to cop a blessing for Agnes, so I sneak into the crippled and lame section.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma, how could you? With a pronounced limp.
SUPFEMALE:The Pope finally arrives, I bend down to kiss his ring.
LEADMALE:Just then, security comes and whisks him away.
SUPMALE:He leaves the ring behind as a memento.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you stole the Pope's ring? It slipped off.
LEADFEMALE:You know, for God's representative on Earth, he sure has sweaty palms.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna take it right back.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, this is a sign.
LEADMALE:Maybe I'm supposed to make a miracle.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, maybe this is my shot at getting into the Bible.
SUPMALE:Ma, the Bible is a done deal.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you can't keep it.
LEADMALE:We're talking about a millenniums-old symbol of the Pope's authority.
LEADMALE:Something so steeped in history and tradition that it makes even you seem middle-aged.
LEADMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, I don't know what got into me.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bring it back.
LEADFEMALE:Wine! Worth a shot.
OTHERMALE:Well, I finally got Miles to forgive me.
OTHERFEMALE:He must've made me promise a million times that I would never, ever doubt him again.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, I have the detective's report here, I think we ought to read it.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Rose! Dorothy, I want to hear that report because I do trust Miles.
SUPFEMALE:And it'll prove that both of you should, too.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to this.
LEADFEMALE:"9:30
SUPFEMALE:confirmed surgery for the following day.
OTHERFEMALE:" Surgery? On what? That's all it says.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my God.
SUPMALE:Oh, now, honey, don't panic.
OTHERMALE:I mean, it--it may not be anything serious.
LEADMALE:Of course it's serious.
LEADMALE:If it was minor, he would have told me about it.
LEADMALE:That's why he's been living for the day.
LEADMALE:He's afraid there won't be a tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:This may not be a good time, but has anyone seen a large, jewel-encrusted ring that's steeped in history just lying around lately? That's it, I'm damned.
SUPMALE:I'll never make it to heaven to see my Sal.
SUPMALE:Now, take it easy, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Let's retrace your steps.
SUPMALE:What did you do when you first got home? Who knows? Nap on the couch, nap on the bed, nap on the lanai.
LEADMALE:I do so much, it's all a blur.
OTHERFEMALE:Then we just have to search room by room.
SUPMALE:It's hopeless.
LEADMALE:We'll never find it.
SUPFEMALE:I say we just wait and pray it turns up, say in the next day or two.
SUPFEMALE:What? Those are the exact words you used when my gold bracelet was missing.
LEADFEMALE:So? So two days later you came back from the dentist saying, "Are these fillings or are these fillings?" What's your point? You didn't lose it, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:You just said you did so you could keep it.
OTHERMALE:Absolutely not.
LEADFEMALE:Not in a million years.
LEADMALE:I swear on my life I don't have it.
LEADMALE:Do you want me to turn you upside down and shake you? You're bluffing.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Have it your way.
LEADFEMALE:Here! Here! I'm sorry, pussycat.
LEADMALE:It'll never happen again.
LEADMALE:I really can't believe this, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:You of all people should know the value of this ring.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, please, I was just trying to buy time.
LEADFEMALE:I can't give up the ring until I know the Pope is gonna bless Agnes.
LEADMALE:It doesn't matter what your reasons are.
SUPMALE:Ma, this ring is important, it was wrong to take it, and I'm going to see that it gets back first thing tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Forget it, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, what's the problem? Oh, Blanche thinks I should go to the hospital tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Well, if Miles didn't tell me about the surgery, doesn't that mean he doesn't want me there? Excuse me, Rose, you're about to make a grave mistake.
LEADMALE:You come to me if you want advice on men.
SUPMALE:You go to Dorothy if there's grammar you want help with.
OTHERMALE:You ended that sentence with a preposition just to bait me.
LEADFEMALE:What would I do that for? Look, I know how to settle this.
LEADFEMALE:Let me tell you a story of the steamy South.
LEADFEMALE:A tale of deception and tragedy.
LEADMALE:Just a second, Uncle Remus.
LEADFEMALE:Give me the ring and I'll tell the Pope to give you a blessing, too.
SUPMALE:Ma, Blanche is telling a story.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sorry.
LEADMALE:Go on.
SUPFEMALE:I was 19.
SUPMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:He might have a blessing that gets men.
LEADMALE:Ma! What? I thought she was finished.
LEADFEMALE:She just said she was 19.
LEADFEMALE:Well, look at her now.
LEADMALE:You don't call that a tragedy? Ma, it is going back and that's final.
SUPMALE:Go ahead, Blanche.
SUPMALE:No, the mood has been ruined.
LEADMALE:Suffice it to say, it involved a men's club, a vine rope, and a large bottle of Absorbine Jr.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, how could you possibly think that this would help Rose decide what to do about Miles being ill in the hospital? Oh, Blanche, God bless you.
LEADFEMALE:I see it all so clearly now.
LEADMALE:I don't care what Miles does, I'm going to be at that hospital tomorrow.
LEADMALE:And she still hasn't worn your sweatshirt.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I called the diocese like you told me, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:The Pope will be here any minute to pick up the ring.
SUPFEMALE:The Pope's comin' here? This is horrible.
LEADFEMALE:What will I wear? I don't believe I have a thing that doesn't call attention to my bosom.
LEADMALE:Try not wearing makeup.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, do you actually think that the Pope makes house calls? He will this time.
OTHERMALE:I made it crystal clear over the phone, if I don't see a Pope on the porch, they can kiss their ring goodbye.
LEADMALE:You're forgetting one thing, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:I have the ring.
LEADMALE:That's the one hole in my plan.
LEADMALE:Look, Ma, I know you're disturbed about your friend, but the Pope coming to people's houses Things like that just don't happen.
SUPFEMALE:That's the difference between you and me, pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:I believe in miracles.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
OTHERFEMALE:Popes hate to be kept waiting.
SUPMALE:Good evening.
LEADMALE:I'm here about the ring.
LEADMALE:You're not the Pope.
LEADMALE:Well, not yet.
LEADFEMALE:But like they say, "You never know when the smoke will blow your way.
SUPFEMALE:" You're not getting the ring.
LEADFEMALE:Father, you'll have to excuse my mother.
LEADFEMALE:She has a special feeling about the ring.
LEADMALE:Please, take it and go.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:I want His Holiness to visit my friend.
OTHERFEMALE:She's in the hospital.
LEADMALE:She's sick and she's scared.
SUPMALE:And what is your friend's name, Mrs.
SUPMALE:Petrillo? No miracles, huh? Agnes O'Rourke.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure you'll understand that the Pontiff cannot make individual visits, but I can assure you a prayer will be said.
LEADMALE:A prayer? That's it? Thank you, Father.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ma, I'm so sorry.
SUPMALE:I know how disappointed you are.
LEADMALE:But believe me, giving that ring back was the right thing to do.
SUPMALE:I'm off to see Miles.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I hope he's all right.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go with you, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Agnes needs me now.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:If I'm not home soon, that probably means Agnes is dead.
LEADFEMALE:And if Agnes is dead, you killed her.
LEADFEMALE:And if you killed her, that makes you a murderer.
SUPFEMALE:Enjoy, Ma.
LEADMALE:Miles? Oh, my poor Miles.
SUPMALE:
SUPMALE:Rose? Rose, is that you? Over here.
SUPMALE:Listen to my little soldier, knocking on heaven's door and still throwing his voice to make me laugh.
LEADFEMALE:No, Rose, Rose, over here.
LEADMALE:T-T-This bed.
SUPFEMALE:Miles? Mile Miles! Sweetheart, may I ask, what are you doing here? I didn't want you to see me like this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanted a chance to say I love you.
SUPMALE:Oh, and there'll be no other man after.
OTHERFEMALE:After? After what? I'm here for my eyes.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank God you're not going to die.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, and don't worry, I can be your eyes.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sweetheart, my eyes are fine.
SUPMALE:It's just the bags underneath them.
LEADFEMALE:Then I can be your bags.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, sweetheart, you don't understand.
SUPMALE:I'm I'm here for cosmetic surgery.
LEADMALE:Cosmetic surgery? Why? Because I look old, Rose.
SUPMALE:Do you have any idea what it's like working on a college campus? Well, I've never worked on one, but I was the subject of a lab experiment once.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute, you never told me that.
LEADFEMALE:They doubled my IQ.
SUPFEMALE:For three days, I was another Einstein.
LEADFEMALE:Then they pulled out the IV.
OTHERMALE:What was in that IV? Smart juice, I guess.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, you don't have to have your eyes done.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Rose, I know it's-- it's silly.
LEADMALE:But, you know, I'm in a youthful environment and I--I want to feel youthful.
SUPMALE:Well, if it's important to you, I'll support you.
LEADFEMALE:But why didn't you tell me about it earlier? Well, for the same reason that those formulas that dye hair do it gradually.
SUPMALE:I mean, it's the kind of thing you want people to notice, but not to be able to pinpoint.
LEADMALE:I didn't know you dyed your hair.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, my hair is gray.
SUPFEMALE:It's been gray since we met.
LEADMALE:Boy, that is gradual.
LEADMALE:Oh, darling, I'm just glad you're okay.
LEADFEMALE:I have had the worst day-and-a-half and it's all because of that dumb detective.
SUPMALE:Oh, sweetheart, let's promise we'll never, ever let something like this come between us again.
SUPMALE:I promise.
LEADMALE:From now on, no more fighting.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, how did you know I was here? Well, that didn't last long, did it? Hello.
SUPMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Oh, Sophia, how's Agnes? About the same.
SUPFEMALE:Is he okay? Oh, yes, he's having cosmetic surgery.
SUPFEMALE:It's about time.
LEADMALE:I'll be in the john.
SUPFEMALE:Reading material.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, who could that  Oh, my, it's him! I think.
SUPMALE:Father.
LEADMALE:Could that be who I think it is? Oh, indeed, ma'am.
SUPFEMALE:The Pontiff is stopping by to bless the patients of St.
SUPFEMALE:Ignatius on his way to the airport.
LEADFEMALE:The Pontiff? Oh, no, no, Rose.
LEADMALE:Let him go.
SUPMALE:No, no, Father, I wouldn't feel right.
LEADMALE:I'm here for crow's feet.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't do that.
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, you won't believe it! You know who's here? The Pope is here! Sophia! The Pope! 
LEADMALE:All my life I've been waiting for this! Oh, okay, I won't disturb you.
LEADFEMALE:Pussycat! Pussycat! I witnessed a miracle! The Pope came to the hospital and blessed Agnes.
SUPMALE:He answered my prayers! He answered me! Oh, ye of little faith.
LEADMALE:Oh, you must feel special, Sophia.
LEADMALE:You must feel blessed.
OTHERFEMALE:And hungry.
OTHERMALE:Come on, Rose, let's go into the kitchen and whip up some loaves and fishes.
SUPMALE:Oh, he had the most beautiful blue eyes.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:All the cute guys are either married or popes.
LEADFEMALE:Ace to the pair.
SUPMALE:No help for the Pontiff.
LEADFEMALE:Read 'em and weep.
LEADFEMALE:Full boat.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:High spade in the hole goes to heaven.
LEADFEMALE:So, any chance of me winning back that ring? Nah, I don't have to cut.
LEADMALE:I trust you.
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Sophia, listen, how about this one? "Elderly white male with broken hip seeks elderly white female.
LEADFEMALE:"I am into massages, bran muffins and the book Final Exit.
LEADFEMALE:"Please respond quickly, or I'll do it.
OTHERMALE:I swear I will.
LEADMALE:" Too much pressure.
LEADMALE:Moving on.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, here's another good one.
SUPMALE:"Recent widower seeks widow.
LEADFEMALE:"I am handsome, intelligent, and possess great style.
LEADFEMALE:"I am also incontinent but have learned to laugh about it.
OTHERMALE:" Well, that's a keeper.
LEADMALE:What is going on here? I'm looking through the personals to find myself a man.
SUPFEMALE:Remember what that is, Dorothy? It's an animal, kind of like a woman, except that it's got a Ma! I know what a man is, but I tell you, I would never look for one through the personals.
SUPMALE:And you know why? Because I have standards.
LEADMALE:I have intelligence.
LEADFEMALE:I have class.
LEADFEMALE:And you know what else I have? It's not self-awareness.
SUPFEMALE:That's for damn sure.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen to this.
SUPFEMALE:"Older gentleman seeks lady of refinement.
OTHERMALE:"I like moonlit nights, romantic Italian dinners "and waking up in the morning.
SUPFEMALE:"If you're old enough to remember when Sinatra was skinny, "please send letter and photo.
OTHERFEMALE:" This is the one.
LEADFEMALE:He's perfect.
LEADMALE:I found myself a man.
SUPMALE:I just got a call from Thor Anderson in St.
OTHERFEMALE:Olaf.
SUPMALE:He's going to be in Miami next week, and we're getting together for dinner and to talk about old times.
OTHERMALE:So? I don't know a Thor Anderson in St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf.
LEADFEMALE:But he certainly knew me.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, it's finally beginning to happen.
LEADMALE:I'm getting old and forgetting things, forgetting people who, at one time, were important to me.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be ridiculous.
LEADMALE:You're as mentally fit as you ever were.
LEADFEMALE:We all are.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you Sophia.
SUPMALE:Sophia.
OTHERMALE:You're welcome Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Rose.
SUPMALE:Any wonder we get nursing-home brochures by the truckload? The guy from the ad will be here any second.
LEADFEMALE:How do I look? Ma, you forgot to zip up your dress.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't forget.
SUPMALE:He's probably got arthritis.
LEADFEMALE:Why make it any harder?  That's him.
LEADFEMALE:All right, now, Sophia, remember, honey, play hard to get.
SUPMALE:It drives a man crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, read that somewhere, did you? Play hard to get.
LEADMALE:Play hard to get.
LEADMALE:Play hard to get.
SUPFEMALE:Take me here.
LEADFEMALE:Take me now.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm looking for Rose Nylund.
LEADMALE:I'm an old  Rose, it's me, Thor.
OTHERFEMALE:Thor? Thor Anderson! I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:Everybody, this is This is Thor Anderson.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:How do you do? Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, everybody.
LEADMALE:Rose and I used to date one another back home.
OTHERMALE:Oh, we had some pretty wild times, didn't we, Rose?  Did we ever! Listen, why don't I go get things settled at my hotel, then I'll come pick you up, and we'll go to dinner? Oh, we got a lot of catching up to do.
SUPMALE:Do we ever!  Great.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be back soon.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't the slightest idea who that man is.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, what is wrong with you? I mean, why didn't you just tell him that you don't know who he is? And hurt an old friend? Boy, Dorothy, no wonder nobody likes you.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, but I already know Jesus.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid there's been a mistake.
SUPMALE:We're here to see Sophia Petrillo.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, won't you come in? Are you Marvin from the ad? Yes, he is.
SUPFEMALE:And are you Sophia? Well, he doesn't look like he'll kill me.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I'm Sophia, and only one little question remains.
LEADMALE:Who the hell are you? I'm Sarah, Marvin's sister.
SUPMALE:Marvin, don't you have something for Sophia? Here.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, it talks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Marvin is just a little shy.
LEADFEMALE:He'll warm up and be more talkative when we go to dinner.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean, "we"? Well, Marvin's eyes aren't what they used to be, and he's not allowed to drive, so he asked me if I would.
SUPFEMALE:I hope you don't mind.
LEADMALE:Marvin wants so much to make a good impression.
LEADMALE:What do you say? No visible means of life support.
SUPMALE:I like that in a man.
LEADFEMALE:Let's roll.
OTHERMALE:You know, I always hoped my mother would meet a nice couple.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, you simply have to help me.
SUPMALE:I've been out with Thor twice now, and I still can't remember who he is, and he's coming here for dinner tonight.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, please eat with us.
OTHERMALE:You can ask questions I can't.
LEADMALE:Oh, all right, fine, but I still don't understand why you cannot remember this man.
LEADFEMALE:He says you seriously dated.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, how many boyfriends could a naive farmer's daughter possibly have had? Two? Three? Well, it depends.
LEADFEMALE:What's your definition of a boyfriend? Any man you bring to a fevered pitch of uncontrollable ecstasy.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Fifty-six.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me? I had about 56 boyfriends.
LEADMALE:Of course, that was before I knew Charlie.
SUPMALE:I probably would have had more, but I wasn't allowed to start dating until I was a senior.
LEADMALE:Fifty-six? Fifty-six? Oh, God, stand back.
LEADMALE:She's gonna blow! What do you mean you had 56 boyfriends? You told me you were a virgin till you got married.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you can have a boyfriend without having to go all the way.
OTHERMALE:You cannot! If that were true, Rose, that would mean you were a slut.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Blanche, how can you say that? So the woman had She's not a slut.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:She is the slut.
OTHERFEMALE:She's the Grand Pooh-Bah of Slutdom.
SUPFEMALE:She's the easiest woman in this room.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy Zbornak, you take that back.
OTHERFEMALE:The slut is dead.
SUPFEMALE:Long live the slut.
SUPMALE:Okay, listen up.
LEADMALE:I've got man trouble, and I need advice from someone with experience.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be happy to help.
SUPFEMALE:I hear you're a tramp, Rose.
SUPMALE:Mama was right.
LEADFEMALE:Word gets around fast.
LEADMALE:You know, I've been dating this guy for a couple of days, and I really like him.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Ma! Honey, that's wonderful.
SUPMALE:Girls, isn't that great? I'm the biggest slut.
SUPMALE:Sophia, don't you think you might be rushing things? Please! The man is 86.
LEADFEMALE:Right now, it's a race between me and the blood clot in his leg to see who gets him first.
LEADMALE:So what's the problem? His sister.
LEADFEMALE:It's weird.
LEADFEMALE:We can't do anything without her.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't been alone with him yet.
LEADMALE:You know how hard it is to make out with a guy when his sister's sitting next to you? Boy, do I ever.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, do I ever.
SUPMALE:Now, you stop that.
LEADMALE:You just stop that.
LEADMALE:Listen, Ma, I have an idea.
LEADMALE:Why don't I go and pick up Marvin, bring him here, and that way, the two of you can be alone? And Blanche and Thor and I will be out on the lanai, so you'll have the living room all to yourselves.
LEADMALE:You're all willing to do this? Well, of course.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, come on, let's go pick out the teeth you'll wear tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Thor, you sound like you were quite a pistol back in high school.
LEADFEMALE:Well I'll bet you had a nickname.
LEADFEMALE:I sure did.
SUPFEMALE:Tell her what it was, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:No, it was your nickname.
LEADFEMALE:You tell her.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Okay, it was Skipper.
LEADMALE:Why Skipper? 'Cause you liked boats? No, I liked to skip.
SUPMALE:I got beat up a lot as a child.
LEADFEMALE:Um, well, were you and Rose really serious? Oh, you bet.
LEADMALE:In fact, Rose Lindstrom gave me my first real kiss.
SUPMALE:I'll never forget that.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, Rose? Do I remember? Would anybody like some more wine? No, no, no.
OTHERMALE:No more for me.
LEADMALE:In fact, I have to visit the little boys' room.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, that's it.
SUPFEMALE:Now I remember who he is.
LEADFEMALE:Who? Thor Anderson was the boy who took me to the Valentine's dance my senior year.
SUPMALE:I asked Thor to take me just to make Charlie jealous.
LEADMALE:Oh, I feel awful.
LEADMALE:I used Thor.
LEADMALE:You say that like it's somethin' bad.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, this is serious.
SUPMALE:I mean, he thinks I cared for him, and I didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Thor, I have a confession to make.
LEADMALE:No, Rose, I have a confession to make.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
SUPFEMALE:It has taken me nine years, ever since I heard Charlie passed away, to get up the nerve to say this, nine years to build up the courage to tell you how I feel, nine years to save enough money for the bus fare to Miami.
SUPMALE:I love you, Rose.
LEADMALE:I've always loved you.
LEADMALE:I've waited a long time for you, and I've finally come to take you back home with me.
LEADMALE:Now, what's your confession? My roommate doesn't wear underwear.
SUPFEMALE:I just want you to know, Marvin, since this is our fourth date, I wouldn't blame you if you tried to steal a little kiss.
LEADFEMALE:That's because you're very understanding.
SUPMALE:Maybe I'm being a little too subtle here.
LEADMALE:Give me your hand, Marvin.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, what do you feel? A MedicAlert tag? It's my heart.
OTHERFEMALE:Can't you feel it pounding? Would anyone here care for an Get out! Get out! Get out! You know, Sophia, we shouldn't be doing this.
OTHERMALE:Sarah's gonna be here any minute Look, Marvin, I know you two are very close, but frankly, she's starting to get on my nerves.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, you mustn't speak about Sarah like that.
SUPMALE:Oh, wake up, Marvin.
LEADMALE:The woman's a control freak.
SUPMALE:It's time you got rid of her.
SUPFEMALE:No, don't say that.
SUPFEMALE:She has no right to run your life.
OTHERFEMALE:She's only your sister.
SUPFEMALE:She's not my sister.
SUPMALE:She's my wife.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, you can come in now.
SUPFEMALE:I thought the two of you would like some nice, cool lemonade.
OTHERMALE:Marvin is married to Sarah.
LEADMALE:You don't get any lemonade.
LEADMALE:I didn't mean to just blurt it out, but I can explain, and I know you and your daughter must have a lot of questions.
SUPFEMALE:You bet we do.
OTHERMALE:And by the way, Dorothy's not my daughter.
LEADFEMALE:She's my lesbian lover.
LEADFEMALE:Ma.
LEADFEMALE:See, Marvin? How do you like it? Not a pretty picture, is it? Marvin, what the hell is going on here? Isn't it obvious? They put an ad in the magazine to lure an unsuspecting cutie like me into their web of sex games.
OTHERMALE:They want me to be their love slave.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, I've come to pick up my brother.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if it isn't Mrs.
LEADMALE:Caligula.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on in and pull up a whip.
LEADMALE:You two have a lot of explaining to do.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, Sarah.
SUPFEMALE:I told them we're married.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Why did you lie to my mother? I didn't want to lie.
LEADMALE:We were going to tell the truth as soon as we were sure that Sophia was the one we wanted.
LEADFEMALE:Then it is true! You wanted my mother for sex games.
LEADMALE:Oh, God, this is so unbelievable.
SUPFEMALE:It's not that unbelievable.
OTHERFEMALE:Sophia, the truth of the matter is I'm dying.
SUPFEMALE:My doctors say I have very few months left, and I told Marvin that I won't be able to rest in peace unless I know that he has someone else.
LEADFEMALE:That's where you come in, Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to take my place.
LEADFEMALE:Again, we're sorry for springing this on you.
SUPFEMALE:I know it came as quite a shock.
LEADMALE:Our hearts go out to both of you, and as soon as Ma and I have talked, we'll get back to you.
LEADMALE:So you'll seriously consider this? Well, of course, we will.
SUPFEMALE:How could we not? What a pair of loons! Ma, this does it.
SUPMALE:No more of this manhunt nonsense.
LEADMALE:I'm getting you a plant.
LEADMALE:What a night.
OTHERMALE:Tell me about it.
LEADFEMALE:Sarah isn't Marvin's sister.
LEADFEMALE:She's his wife.
OTHERMALE:She's dying, and she wants Ma to replace her.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, this is why she's been on all their dates and asked so many questions.
SUPFEMALE:Ever since she found out what her prognosis is, well, she and Marvin have been searching desperately to find a replacement.
SUPFEMALE:And the replacement? My mother.
OTHERFEMALE:Sophia, I know how much you liked Marvin.
OTHERMALE:Honey, I'm so sorry it didn't work out.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna do it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, Ma, you can't be serious.
SUPMALE:Sarah is dying.
LEADFEMALE:It's terrible, but I can't change that, and I--I really care for Marvin.
OTHERMALE:And if we can all be happy together and not be alone, what's wrong with that?  That's Thor.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, would you mind? We're going to need our privacy.
OTHERMALE:Now, Rose, that's not fair.
LEADMALE:I want to see you dump him.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I let you watch when I broke up with my last guy.
LEADMALE:No, you didn't.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Well, I have it on videotape.
OTHERFEMALE:Would you like to see it? Get out.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, you sounded so strange on the phone.
LEADMALE:Is something wrong? Tell me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why don't we sit down first? Oh, boy, you and me snuggling on a couch, brings back a lot of memories, doesn't it? Actually, no.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I want to talk to you about.
LEADFEMALE:Thor, ever since you got here, you've been talking about things we did and things we said, and I don't remember any of it.
SUPMALE:So you don't remember every little detail.
OTHERMALE:At least, you remember what's important.
LEADMALE:You remember the kiss, our first kiss.
LEADMALE:Well This doesn't make any sense.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, maybe you don't remember because you've suffered some brain damage.
LEADFEMALE:Thor, the one thing I do remember is that I only went out with you because of Charlie Nylund.
LEADMALE:I used you to make Charlie jealous.
SUPMALE:It was Charlie I loved, not you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I I feel so stupid, so incredibly stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know what it's like to feel this stupid?  
OTHERFEMALE:Ow! Well, I probably should go now.
SUPMALE:I've bothered you enough.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm so sorry, Thor.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry I don't remember.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
SUPMALE:Rose? What? Maybe that'll last me another 40 years.
LEADFEMALE:It was the haystack.
SUPFEMALE:What? Our first kiss.
OTHERMALE:It was at night, and the air was crisp.
LEADFEMALE:You were wearing a blue and white striped shirt, and we were in a haystack.
LEADMALE:Yes! Yes, that's it! But you said you couldn't remember.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess I just needed a little help.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:You don't know what that means to me.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, you remembered.
OTHERMALE:A kiss unlocked your memory.
LEADFEMALE:One doesn't forget a kiss like that.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's so romantic.
SUPFEMALE:No, it isn't.
LEADFEMALE:That man didn't know how to kiss 40 years ago, and he doesn't know how to kiss today.
SUPFEMALE:Now that we've finalized our little arrangement, I'd like to propose a toast.
LEADFEMALE:To Sophia, whose generosity and kindness of spirit have given us a gift beyond measure.
LEADMALE:I, too, have a toast.
SUPMALE:I predict nothing but disaster and tragedy for everyone connected with this travesty of an idea.
LEADMALE:She's not gonna be living with us, is she? Marvin, I hope you're not boring Sophia with all those photos.
LEADMALE:Oh, he's not.
SUPFEMALE:I'm enjoying it.
LEADMALE:Here's one taken when we first met.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Sarah, tell them the story.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, they don't want to hear that.
SUPFEMALE:Sure we do.
LEADFEMALE:Well, when I was 19, I answered the door one day to find the most handsome man I'd ever seen.
SUPFEMALE:He was selling encyclopedias.
LEADFEMALE:And I told him, "Right now, I can only afford to buy volume one, "but if you could come back next week, maybe I could buy more.
LEADFEMALE:" So for the very next year, he came every week, and I would buy one volume at a time until I realized that I had three sets of encyclopedia and I'd go broke unless I married him.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now, where were we? Uh Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:I feel a lot better now that we've got everything settled, so I think we ought to go over all my I can't do it.
LEADFEMALE:I can't go through with this.
SUPMALE:Ma, what's wrong? Sophia, what are you talking about? This just isn't gonna work.
SUPFEMALE:I was doing this because I wanted to help, because I know what it's like to lose the most important person in your life, but this isn't right.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Marvin, I like you, but I saw how you looked at Sarah a moment ago.
SUPMALE:I don't think you could ever look at me that way.
LEADMALE:Do you realize how hard it was to find you? Do you realize how much time we've wasted? The only time you're wasting is the time that you and Marvin should be spending together.
SUPFEMALE:You don't know what you're talking about.
LEADFEMALE:This is what Marvin wants.
SUPMALE:No, it isn't.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy's right.
LEADMALE:What? I never wanted this.
SUPFEMALE:I only went along because it meant so much to you.
LEADMALE:Well, I only did it to make you happy.
LEADFEMALE:Sarah, dear, can't we just be together, the two of us? I feel so guilty for leaving you.
SUPFEMALE:Don't.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be along soon enough.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, come on.
LEADMALE:I guess we've all learned something from this.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you can never really replace someone you've lost, and the next time I answer an ad, it'll be from one of Blanche's magazines.
LEADFEMALE:Those people know what they want.
SUPFEMALE:"Retired clergyman seeks companion "for European tour of ancient cathedrals.
LEADMALE:"No prudes.
LEADMALE:" Circle that.
LEADFEMALE:Big star.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, here's another one.
SUPFEMALE:"Recently devastated man seeks companion.
LEADFEMALE:"Enjoys walks in the rain, midnight swims "and skipping"? What kind of a jerk would go out with a guy like that? 
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Hello? You wanna talk to who? Dorothy? Sorry, you must've dialed the wrong number.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, what do you mean, wrong number? Oh, it was a man, so I just assumed  Hello? Yes, this is she.
SUPFEMALE:I don't believe it! Well Oh, that's great.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you come here? We'll have lunch.
OTHERMALE:Oh, fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine, I'll see you then.
SUPFEMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPMALE:Well? Well, what? Oh, now, Dorothy, fess up.
OTHERMALE:I know that was a man.
SUPMALE:I can always tell when a man calls 'cause you start sweatin' and get a bad case of the giggles.
LEADMALE:I do not.
LEADFEMALE:All right, talk.
SUPMALE:It's no big deal.
LEADFEMALE:That was my 11th grade English teacher from back in Brooklyn, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Gordon.
LEADMALE:He's moved to Miami, and he wants to get together tomorrow for lunch.
LEADFEMALE:End of story.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Gordon.
LEADMALE:Dorothy had a huge embarrassing crush on him.
LEADFEMALE:She was his slave.
LEADMALE:She graded his papers, did his laundry.
LEADMALE:Once, she even rotated his tires.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, that stroke didn't make you forget a thing, did it, Ma? A crush on the teacher.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, I had those.
LEADFEMALE:Course, I had to hide them because they made the principal jealous.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, though, once, I did have a fling with the calculus teacher.
LEADMALE:Oh, and did you get an A?  More like a full scholarship to MIT.
LEADMALE:My Dorothy didn't date teachers in high school.
LEADMALE:She dated losers like Stan who knocked her up and ruined her life forever.
SUPMALE:It would be like a day without orange juice, wouldn't it, Ma? Girls, guess what? They gave me another job at the television station.
SUPFEMALE:The old associate producer quit, so now I am the new associate producer of the Wake-Up! Miami show.
OTHERFEMALE:They even gave me a nameplate for my desk.
LEADMALE:"Harold Goldstein, Associate Producer.
LEADMALE:" Isn't it exciting? Oh, congratulations, Harold.
LEADFEMALE:That's great.
SUPMALE:We've already had our first meeting.
OTHERFEMALE:I suggested we do a show about women who live together, and they jumped on it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Rose, that's a great idea.
LEADMALE:We already have two women lined up.
LEADFEMALE:We just have to find two more.
OTHERFEMALE:Why, my God, Rose, open your eyes! This is exactly the kind of exposure I've been lookin' for.
LEADMALE:Please, enough of your exposure.
LEADMALE:We've already lost three gardeners.
LEADMALE:No, wait, Dorothy, this is a wonderful idea.
LEADMALE:I mean, you and Blanche live together.
SUPMALE:Why don't you do the show? Oh, I would love to.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I wouldn't mind doing it.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, there are some very important issues I'd like to discuss.
SUPFEMALE:What the hell.
SUPFEMALE:I'll do it, too.
LEADMALE:Oh, sorry, Sophia.
SUPMALE:There's only room for two more guests on the panel.
LEADFEMALE:That's not fair.
SUPFEMALE:Why should I be left out? If I don't do it, Dorothy won't do it.
LEADFEMALE:So, when do you want me there? Hi, girls.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, don't you look nice.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thank you, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:Gordon is coming over for lunch today.
LEADFEMALE:We're having it out on the lanai.
SUPMALE:So that's why you're acting like it's the first day of school.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Gordon is coming over.
LEADFEMALE:Mother, just stop that.
OTHERFEMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Gordon is probably over 70 by now.
LEADMALE:He's practically ancient.
LEADFEMALE:Seventy is ancient? If I met a man that age who looked halfway decent, I'd be on my back before you could say, "I've fallen and I can't get up.
LEADMALE:" That's great, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:That's really beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:But there's nothing like that between me and Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Gordon.
SUPFEMALE:If you don't believe me, why don't you join us for lunch? Join you for lunch? Let me check my social calendar.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, okay, I'm free.
LEADMALE:Ma, that calendar's from 1984.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, this is the day I escaped from Shady Pines.
LEADFEMALE:It says right here, "I'm free! I'm free!"  Oh, Mr.
LEADMALE:Gordon.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, you look wonderful.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thank you, Mr.
SUPMALE:Gordon.
LEADMALE:Hey, no more of that Mr.
LEADMALE:Gordon stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:It's Malcolm.
OTHERMALE:Absolutely, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Malcolm.
LEADFEMALE:Come, meet my roommates.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Blanche, Rose, my mother Sophia, Malcolm Gordon.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, of course.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Petrillo.
LEADFEMALE:We met before.
LEADMALE:You were having a problem with my son, Phil.
OTHERMALE:Oh, right.
LEADFEMALE:The problem with the dress code.
LEADMALE:I still don't understand the problem.
SUPMALE:He was wearing a dress.
LEADFEMALE:My goodness, you're as cute as Dorothy said you'd be.
LEADFEMALE:That never happens.
LEADFEMALE:Well, a lot of my ex-students were surprised that I wasn't older, but, uh, they failed to realize I started teaching right out of college.
LEADFEMALE:I really wasn't much older than they were.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I--I guess when you're 17, and forbidden.
OTHERFEMALE:When you're 17, a cow can seem dangerous and forbidden.
LEADFEMALE:Am I alone here? Well, uh, why don't we go out to the lanai?  Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Didn't you forget something? Oh, yes, of course.
SUPFEMALE:Goodbye, Mother.
LEADMALE:What? What, goodbye? You invited me to lunch.
OTHERFEMALE:Rain check, rain check.
SUPFEMALE:I think that is a lovely idea, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Petrillo.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be on my best behavior.
LEADMALE:I won't say or do anything to embarrass you.
LEADMALE:Oh, wait.
OTHERFEMALE:Goofy pictures of Dorothy when she was a kid.
LEADMALE:Might as well have a couple of laughs over lunch.
LEADMALE:Oh, here's a picture of Dorothy's ninth birthday party.
OTHERMALE:Look how scared the clown looks.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I can't believe you actually got a clown for my birthday.
LEADMALE:I can still see his big red nose and those huge black circles around his eyes.
LEADMALE:Oh, he wasn't a real clown.
SUPMALE:He was a friend of your father's.
LEADFEMALE:He'd been beaten up the night before.
LEADMALE:We gave him a couple of bucks.
LEADMALE:I guess that's why he kept saying, "Now, remember, kids, nobody likes a squealer.
SUPMALE:" Here are some pictures of Dorothy at 11, a hilariously awkward age for her.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, enough with the pictures.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you get us some coffee? 'Cause it gives me the trots.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I get it.
OTHERMALE:Company.
LEADFEMALE:Company.
OTHERFEMALE:Pardon me.
OTHERFEMALE:She's charming.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're very kind.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry she bored you with all these old pictures.
LEADMALE:Nonsense, I enjoyed it.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Look.
OTHERMALE:Look, your graduation picture.
LEADMALE:You were such a lovely girl.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I never felt that way.
LEADFEMALE:I always felt awkward and clumsy, except in your class.
SUPMALE:You made me feel intelligent and beautiful and special.
LEADFEMALE:I never forgot that.
LEADMALE:And I have never forgotten you.
LEADFEMALE:So, how do you like being retired? Actually, I intend to work.
SUPMALE:I just got my first assignment to write an article for the book review section.
LEADMALE:I'm a little nervous.
LEADFEMALE:It's due next week.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, now you know how we used to feel when you would assign us a book report.
SUPFEMALE:I remember that crazy excuse you used when you didn't hand your paper in.
OTHERFEMALE:What was it? Oh, that you'd married that kid, Stan, what's his name? Gee, I don't remember.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm having a little trouble getting started.
LEADMALE:I can't seem to get my thoughts organized.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, maybe you'd like a little help.
LEADMALE:Really? I certainly could use a little.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'd be happy to.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that is great.
LEADMALE:We'll start tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm doing a TV show tomorrow morning.
SUPMALE:A TV show? Well, I'm impressed.
LEADMALE:Well, no, it's just a little old local show, but they're anxious to get my views on women's issues.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, why don't you come to the studio, and we can start right after? Perfect.
LEADFEMALE:Just perfect.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, to us.
LEADFEMALE:More goofy pictures!  Here's Dorothy in her wedding gown.
LEADFEMALE:Look how scared the groom looks.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, come on, Blanche.
LEADMALE:You're on in one minute.
SUPMALE:You sit over there, and--and, Dorothy, you get touched up, and, Sophia, come on, I'll see if I can find you a seat in the audience.
SUPMALE:Hurry up, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy? Well, you look lovely.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:For your television debut.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, they're beautiful.
SUPMALE:Dorothy? Good luck.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:We're starting.
LEADFEMALE:He kissed me.
LEADFEMALE:He gave me flowers.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, come on, it's almost time.
LEADFEMALE:Over here, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
LEADMALE:All right, you sit over there.
OTHERFEMALE:Down there, that's it.
SUPMALE:What's wrong with her? Malcolm kissed her.
SUPFEMALE:My God, she's in shock.
SUPMALE:He gave me flowers from a store.
SUPFEMALE:Ladies, good morning.
LEADMALE:We go on in about 10 seconds.
OTHERMALE:Oh! Just relax and have a fun show, okay?  Good morning and welcome to Wake-Up! Miami.
LEADFEMALE:Today, women who live together.
LEADMALE:Does society make it tougher? We'll find out when we talk to four lesbians today on Wake-Up! Miami.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, could I see you for moment? You're mad, aren't you? Rose Nylund, every man I know is watching this show.
OTHERFEMALE:This live show.
LEADFEMALE:This live show about lesbian lovers of Miami.
LEADFEMALE:Every man you know is watching? Hey, we could beat The Price Is Right.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, we can't kill you here because there are cameras.
LEADMALE:Now, how did this happen? Oh, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:They just said they wanted two women who loved each other and slept together.
LEADFEMALE:We do not sleep together! Yes, you did.
LEADFEMALE:Last month, when When Blanche was having her room repainted because the plaster behind her headboard all fell out.
LEADFEMALE:We're back in 30 seconds, ladies.
OTHERMALE:Listen, I'm not gonna do this.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, if you leave, they'll fire me.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:My mother is here.
LEADFEMALE:My teacher is here.
OTHERMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:If I lose my job, I won't be able to do anything but sit home and tell St.
LEADMALE:Olaf stories.
LEADMALE:Blackmail.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, very smart.
SUPMALE:Hey, they don't call me Harold Goldstein for nothing.
LEADMALE:Maybe if we don't say anything, we're not on camera that much.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we can't let Rose lose her job.
LEADMALE:We're back.
LEADFEMALE:Let's meet our panelists.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, a lesbian.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, another lesbian.
SUPFEMALE:And Pat and Kathy, image consultants.
LEADMALE:How come they're not lesbians? We don't believe in labels.
LEADMALE:Oh, I see we have a question from the audience.
LEADMALE:Yes, sir.
OTHERMALE:Are there male/female roles in the relationship? Well, I am the little homemaker, if that's what you mean.
LEADMALE:Now, wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Just  And I take out the garbage.
LEADFEMALE:Fascinating, huh? Any other questions? Ah, here we go.
LEADMALE:This is directed to Dorothy's lover.
LEADFEMALE:Do people treat you differently because you're a lesbian? Well, most people don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Really? I would've guessed right off.
SUPMALE:Next question to Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of pain and embarrassment has this lifestyle caused your mother? I really don't know, but I'll ask her tomorrow when I visit her at the home.
SUPMALE:No more questions.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Not one phone call all day.
LEADFEMALE:That's not true, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:The phone's been ringing off the hook.
LEADFEMALE:Not one phone call from a man all day, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, Dorothy, if I were a lesbian, I sure would be a popular one.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this, 20 calls.
LEADFEMALE:"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the" Oh, what am I doin'? Listen to me.
SUPMALE:Rose, I could just strangle you.
LEADFEMALE:So you're still miffed? Well, I don't mind bein' labeled a lesbian, honey, but since I'm not, you just ruined my social life.
OTHERMALE:Oh, go ahead.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I'm a bubblehead and I deserve to die.
LEADFEMALE:I said I'm a bubblehead and I deserve to die.
LEADFEMALE:And it was worth repeating.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, I just got off the phone with my girlfriend Gladys.
LEADMALE:She thinks you can do better than Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:I agree, but, Ma, if it's all right with you, I have a lot of work to do here.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you're still working on that article.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you were just gonna help organize it.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you're doing this again.
LEADFEMALE:You're letting him take advantage of you like he did in high school.
LEADFEMALE:He is under a lot of pressure, and I don't want him to kiss his deadline.
SUPMALE:Miss.
OTHERFEMALE:Miss his deadline.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Gordon.
LEADMALE:Oh, all right.
LEADFEMALE:I admit it.
OTHERFEMALE:I do have a little crush, but his kiss just took me by surprise.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, at first, I didn't think he was going to do it.
LEADMALE:He looked more like he was going to wink, but then he slanted his head just slightly to the left.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I know that slant.
LEADFEMALE:You know every slant.
LEADMALE:So why don't you let my daughter finish her one kissing story of the year? Thank you, Ma.
LEADMALE:My pleasure, meal ticket.
OTHERMALE:It was at that point that I realized his head was coming toward me.
SUPMALE:Were his eyes open or closed? Open.
LEADMALE:And then he landed.
LEADFEMALE:I thought, "Oh, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Gordon! "Oh, if only Cynthia Costello was here to see this.
OTHERFEMALE:"  Kinky.
SUPFEMALE:I don't wanna hear any more of this.
LEADMALE:I don't like you being taken advantage of by some guy from out of town.
LEADFEMALE:At least, when Blanche does it, it's good for tourism.
LEADMALE:Then you're really not mad at me anymore? Rose, I'm a reasonable person.
LEADFEMALE:I forgive you.
LEADFEMALE:Does that mean you'll turn my heat back on? I was really chilly last night.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, what made you decide to forgive Rose? Because I'm reasonable and kind and considerate, and I'm back in the game.
LEADMALE:I have a date tonight with a young man I met in the produce department at the market.
LEADMALE:I showed him how to thump a melon.
LEADFEMALE:There's a euphemism we haven't heard before.
OTHERMALE:I realized something.
LEADFEMALE:Just because every man in my life thinks I'm a lesbian doesn't mean there aren't thousands and hundreds and millions of men out there who don't.
LEADFEMALE:That must be my melon man.
LEADFEMALE:Zorro rides again.
LEADFEMALE:Chuck! Thumper! Not exactly a Disney movie, is it? Oh, Chuck, this is my roommate Rose, and this is my roommate Dorothy and her mama, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, I recognize them from TV.
LEADMALE:You You saw the show? Yes, I did.
LEADMALE:Blanche, it was one of the things that attracted me to you.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, you don't understand.
SUPMALE:No, I do understand, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I understand that you're this way because you've probably never been with a real man.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, do I wet myself or laugh? All you need is to be loved by someone who knows how.
LEADMALE:Someone who will take his time and then show you passion beyond your wildest dreams.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, it's over between us.
SUPMALE:Blanche! Dorothy, now don't try to stop me.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you see I have to try this? Oh, all right, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I I understand.
LEADFEMALE:You're a good sport.
LEADMALE:You just take care of her.
LEADFEMALE:Malcolm.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, I hope you don't mind me dropping by, but, well, I got an advance copy of the book review, and I thought you'd like to see our article in print.
LEADFEMALE:Are you kidding? Oh, let me read it.
OTHERFEMALE:"'Nineteenth Century Writers Living in the Twentieth Century' "by Malcolm Gordon.
LEADMALE:" I see you used my title.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Read on, read on.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, is something wrong? Well, this is exactly the same article that I gave you.
SUPMALE:Well, it didn't need a lot of work.
LEADFEMALE:I--I didn't have to add much.
LEADFEMALE:I notice you didn't add my name to it.
OTHERMALE:Well, no, no, not this time, but--but next time.
OTHERFEMALE:What makes you think there'll be a next time? Well, Dorothy, I did rewrite your article, but, well, they asked for a lot of changes in just a few short hours.
LEADMALE:So, I I submitted your pages and Well, I was just too embarrassed to tell them that it was your work, but it won't happen again, I promise.
SUPFEMALE:No, it won't.
SUPMALE:Goodbye, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Gordon.
SUPMALE:Malcolm.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:So am I.
SUPMALE:What's wrong, Dorothy? Ma, you were right again.
SUPMALE:He was just using me.
OTHERFEMALE:Sit down, pussycat.
LEADMALE:I wanna tell you something.
SUPMALE:You give too much, and when you do that, you're gonna get hurt.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:Oh, but I was so disappointed.
SUPMALE:For 40 years, I've had this fantasy that Mr.
LEADMALE:Gordon would come swooping into my life like Sir Lancelot.
LEADFEMALE:Now I don't even have that.
LEADMALE:You can keep the fantasy alive.
SUPMALE:It's part of life.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I call my pillow? Sal.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes I hug it.
SUPMALE:Sometimes it lays there like a big lump, just like your father.
SUPMALE:That's how I keep him alive.
LEADMALE:That's lovely, Ma.
OTHERMALE:You know what I call my other pillow? Dino.
LEADMALE:But that's another story.
OTHERMALE:I'll tell you about it when you're, oh, about 70.
LEADMALE:I'll be here.
LEADFEMALE:So will I, pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:So will I.
SUPMALE:Yes? Hi, I--I don't know if you remember me.
OTHERFEMALE:My name is Pat.
LEADFEMALE:I was on Wake-Up! Miami with you last week.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, yes, of course.
OTHERMALE:What can I do for you? I heard about you and Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:It's too soon.
LEADMALE:Too soon.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Hello? You wanna talk to who? Dorothy? Sorry, you must've dialed the wrong number.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, what do you mean, wrong number? Oh, it was a man, so I just assumed  Hello? Yes, this is she.
SUPFEMALE:I don't believe it! Well Oh, that's great.

LEADFEMALE:I never forgot that.
SUPFEMALE:And I have never forgotten you.
SUPFEMALE:So, how do you like being retired? Actually, I intend to work.
LEADFEMALE:I just got my first assignment to write an article for the book review section.
LEADMALE:I'm a little nervous.
SUPMALE:It's due next week.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, now you know how we used to feel when you would assign us a book report.
LEADMALE:I remember that crazy excuse you used when you didn't hand your paper in.
LEADMALE:What was it? Oh, that you'd married that kid, Stan, what's his name? Gee, I don't remember.
SUPMALE:I'm having a little trouble getting started.
LEADFEMALE:I can't seem to get my thoughts organized.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, maybe you'd like a little help.
LEADFEMALE:Really? I certainly could use a little.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'd be happy to.
SUPMALE:Well, that is great.
LEADMALE:We'll start tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm doing a TV show tomorrow morning.
OTHERFEMALE:A TV show? Well, I'm impressed.
LEADMALE:Well, no, it's just a little old local show, but they're anxious to get my views on women's issues.
SUPMALE:Hey, why don't you come to the studio, and we can start right after? Perfect.
SUPMALE:Just perfect.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, to us.
LEADFEMALE:More goofy pictures!  Here's Dorothy in her wedding gown.
LEADMALE:Look how scared the groom looks.
SUPMALE:Okay, come on, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:You're on in one minute.
SUPMALE:You sit over there, and--and, Dorothy, you get touched up, and, Sophia, come on, I'll see if I can find you a seat in the audience.
LEADMALE:Hurry up, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Dorothy? Well, you look lovely.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:For your television debut.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, they're beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy? Good luck.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:We're starting.
OTHERFEMALE:He kissed me.
LEADFEMALE:He gave me flowers.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, come on, it's almost time.
OTHERMALE:Over here, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
LEADMALE:All right, you sit over there.
SUPFEMALE:Down there, that's it.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with her? Malcolm kissed her.
LEADFEMALE:My God, she's in shock.
LEADMALE:He gave me flowers from a store.
LEADFEMALE:Ladies, good morning.
OTHERFEMALE:We go on in about 10 seconds.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Just relax and have a fun show, okay?  Good morning and welcome to Wake-Up! Miami.
OTHERMALE:Today, women who live together.
LEADMALE:Does society make it tougher? We'll find out when we talk to four lesbians today on Wake-Up! Miami.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, could I see you for moment? You're mad, aren't you? Rose Nylund, every man I know is watching this show.
SUPMALE:This live show.
LEADFEMALE:This live show about lesbian lovers of Miami.
LEADFEMALE:Every man you know is watching? Hey, we could beat The Price Is Right.
LEADMALE:Rose, we can't kill you here because there are cameras.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, how did this happen? Oh, I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:They just said they wanted two women who loved each other and slept together.
SUPFEMALE:We do not sleep together! Yes, you did.
LEADFEMALE:Last month, when When Blanche was having her room repainted because the plaster behind her headboard all fell out.
LEADFEMALE:We're back in 30 seconds, ladies.
LEADMALE:Listen, I'm not gonna do this.
LEADMALE:Blanche, if you leave, they'll fire me.
LEADMALE:Good.
OTHERMALE:My mother is here.
LEADMALE:My teacher is here.
OTHERFEMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:If I lose my job, I won't be able to do anything but sit home and tell St.
SUPFEMALE:Olaf stories.
SUPMALE:Blackmail.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, very smart.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, they don't call me Harold Goldstein for nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe if we don't say anything, we're not on camera that much.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, we can't let Rose lose her job.
LEADFEMALE:We're back.
LEADMALE:Let's meet our panelists.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, a lesbian.
LEADMALE:Blanche, another lesbian.
LEADFEMALE:And Pat and Kathy, image consultants.
LEADMALE:How come they're not lesbians? We don't believe in labels.
SUPMALE:Oh, I see we have a question from the audience.
LEADMALE:Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Are there male/female roles in the relationship? Well, I am the little homemaker, if that's what you mean.
LEADFEMALE:Now, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Just  And I take out the garbage.
LEADMALE:Fascinating, huh? Any other questions? Ah, here we go.
LEADMALE:This is directed to Dorothy's lover.
LEADMALE:Do people treat you differently because you're a lesbian? Well, most people don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Really? I would've guessed right off.
LEADFEMALE:Next question to Dorothy.
SUPMALE:What kind of pain and embarrassment has this lifestyle caused your mother? I really don't know, but I'll ask her tomorrow when I visit her at the home.
SUPMALE:No more questions.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Not one phone call all day.
LEADMALE:That's not true, Blanche.
LEADMALE:The phone's been ringing off the hook.
LEADFEMALE:Not one phone call from a man all day, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:By the way, Dorothy, if I were a lesbian, I sure would be a popular one.
LEADMALE:Look at this, 20 calls.
OTHERMALE:"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the" Oh, what am I doin'? Listen to me.
SUPMALE:Rose, I could just strangle you.
SUPFEMALE:So you're still miffed? Well, I don't mind bein' labeled a lesbian, honey, but since I'm not, you just ruined my social life.
SUPMALE:Oh, go ahead.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, I'm a bubblehead and I deserve to die.
SUPMALE:I said I'm a bubblehead and I deserve to die.
LEADMALE:And it was worth repeating.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I just got off the phone with my girlfriend Gladys.
LEADFEMALE:She thinks you can do better than Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I agree, but, Ma, if it's all right with you, I have a lot of work to do here.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe you're still working on that article.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you were just gonna help organize it.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you're doing this again.
LEADMALE:You're letting him take advantage of you like he did in high school.
LEADMALE:He is under a lot of pressure, and I don't want him to kiss his deadline.
LEADFEMALE:Miss.
LEADMALE:Miss his deadline.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Gordon.
SUPMALE:Oh, all right.
LEADFEMALE:I admit it.
SUPFEMALE:I do have a little crush, but his kiss just took me by surprise.
OTHERMALE:You know, at first, I didn't think he was going to do it.
LEADFEMALE:He looked more like he was going to wink, but then he slanted his head just slightly to the left.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know that slant.
SUPFEMALE:You know every slant.
LEADFEMALE:So why don't you let my daughter finish her one kissing story of the year? Thank you, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:My pleasure, meal ticket.
LEADFEMALE:It was at that point that I realized his head was coming toward me.
LEADFEMALE:Were his eyes open or closed? Open.
SUPMALE:And then he landed.
SUPFEMALE:I thought, "Oh, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Gordon! "Oh, if only Cynthia Costello was here to see this.
LEADFEMALE:"  Kinky.
SUPFEMALE:I don't wanna hear any more of this.
SUPMALE:I don't like you being taken advantage of by some guy from out of town.
LEADMALE:At least, when Blanche does it, it's good for tourism.
LEADMALE:Then you're really not mad at me anymore? Rose, I'm a reasonable person.
LEADFEMALE:I forgive you.
LEADFEMALE:Does that mean you'll turn my heat back on? I was really chilly last night.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, what made you decide to forgive Rose? Because I'm reasonable and kind and considerate, and I'm back in the game.
LEADFEMALE:I have a date tonight with a young man I met in the produce department at the market.
LEADMALE:I showed him how to thump a melon.
LEADFEMALE:There's a euphemism we haven't heard before.
LEADFEMALE:I realized something.
LEADMALE:Just because every man in my life thinks I'm a lesbian doesn't mean there aren't thousands and hundreds and millions of men out there who don't.
SUPFEMALE:That must be my melon man.
SUPMALE:Zorro rides again.
SUPFEMALE:Chuck! Thumper! Not exactly a Disney movie, is it? Oh, Chuck, this is my roommate Rose, and this is my roommate Dorothy and her mama, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, I recognize them from TV.
SUPFEMALE:You You saw the show? Yes, I did.
OTHERMALE:Blanche, it was one of the things that attracted me to you.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, you don't understand.
LEADMALE:No, I do understand, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:I understand that you're this way because you've probably never been with a real man.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, do I wet myself or laugh? All you need is to be loved by someone who knows how.
LEADMALE:Someone who will take his time and then show you passion beyond your wildest dreams.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, it's over between us.
LEADMALE:Blanche! Dorothy, now don't try to stop me.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you see I have to try this? Oh, all right, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I I understand.
SUPMALE:You're a good sport.
LEADFEMALE:You just take care of her.
LEADMALE:Malcolm.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, I hope you don't mind me dropping by, but, well, I got an advance copy of the book review, and I thought you'd like to see our article in print.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you kidding? Oh, let me read it.
SUPMALE:"'Nineteenth Century Writers Living in the Twentieth Century' "by Malcolm Gordon.
OTHERMALE:" I see you used my title.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:Read on, read on.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, is something wrong? Well, this is exactly the same article that I gave you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it didn't need a lot of work.
SUPMALE:I--I didn't have to add much.
LEADFEMALE:I notice you didn't add my name to it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, no, no, not this time, but--but next time.
SUPMALE:What makes you think there'll be a next time? Well, Dorothy, I did rewrite your article, but, well, they asked for a lot of changes in just a few short hours.
LEADMALE:So, I I submitted your pages and Well, I was just too embarrassed to tell them that it was your work, but it won't happen again, I promise.
LEADMALE:No, it won't.
OTHERMALE:Goodbye, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Gordon.
SUPMALE:Malcolm.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
OTHERMALE:So am I.
SUPMALE:What's wrong, Dorothy? Ma, you were right again.
LEADFEMALE:He was just using me.
SUPFEMALE:Sit down, pussycat.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna tell you something.
SUPMALE:You give too much, and when you do that, you're gonna get hurt.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, but I was so disappointed.
OTHERMALE:For 40 years, I've had this fantasy that Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Gordon would come swooping into my life like Sir Lancelot.
OTHERFEMALE:Now I don't even have that.
SUPFEMALE:You can keep the fantasy alive.
SUPMALE:It's part of life.
SUPFEMALE:You know what I call my pillow? Sal.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes I hug it.
LEADMALE:Sometimes it lays there like a big lump, just like your father.
SUPFEMALE:That's how I keep him alive.
OTHERMALE:That's lovely, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I call my other pillow? Dino.
OTHERFEMALE:But that's another story.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you about it when you're, oh, about 70.
LEADMALE:I'll be here.
SUPFEMALE:So will I, pussycat.
OTHERFEMALE:So will I.
LEADMALE:Yes? Hi, I--I don't know if you remember me.
OTHERMALE:My name is Pat.
LEADMALE:I was on Wake-Up! Miami with you last week.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes, yes, of course.
SUPMALE:What can I do for you? I heard about you and Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:It's too soon.
OTHERFEMALE:Too soon.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, there you are.
LEADMALE:Listen, honey, I have a favor I have to ask.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, forget it.
OTHERFEMALE:You're just gonna laugh.
LEADFEMALE:No, I won't.
LEADMALE:Yes, you will.
LEADFEMALE:No, I won't.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, you will.
LEADFEMALE:You'll just turn it into one hearty laugh at my expense.
SUPMALE:Now, Dorothy, this really hurts me.
LEADFEMALE:I will not.
LEADMALE:You won't even giggle? No.
LEADFEMALE:Not even a titter? Dorothy, I won't laugh.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, I'll tell you, honey.
SUPFEMALE:I have a blind date tonight, and I want you to go out with him.
SUPMALE:You're right, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:This is one hearty laugh at your expense.
OTHERMALE:At least Blanche kept her word.
LEADMALE:She didn't laugh.
OTHERMALE:And you know why? I was singing a little song in my mind.
LEADMALE:Camptown Races.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't hear a word you said.
LEADFEMALE:She said she had a date tonight, and she wants you to go out with him.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that's funny.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, that is really funny.
LEADMALE:I mean, that is funny! It's even funnier the second time.
LEADFEMALE:Ditto.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Yes, we're sorry, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Now, come on and tell me why you need this favor.
LEADMALE:No way.
SUPFEMALE:You'll only laugh again.
SUPMALE:Now, stop it, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:I really do wanna help you, if I can.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, we're not monsters.
SUPFEMALE:We promise not to laugh.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:Well, all right, I want you to go out with my blind date tonight because I have other plans.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Now, just stop that.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Blanche, are you gonna do this or not? Because my date is on his way over, and I just won a ticket on the radio to a dinner theater Beatlemania.
SUPFEMALE:Shut up, Ma.
OTHERFEMALE:Beatlemania? You're giving up a date for Beatlemania? Oh, Rose, the Beatles were the first and only rock-and-roll group that I ever really loved.
LEADMALE:When they came to Shea Stadium, I managed to get a ticket, but one of my kids came down with the flu.
SUPMALE:It was one of those times when you have to pretend that you love your kids more than something you really wanna do.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Anyway, I've always regretted missing out on that one night of history.
SUPMALE:Oh, Blanche, I never got to see them, and the closest I'll ever get is Beatlemania.
LEADFEMALE:It's not really the Beatles, but it's an incredible simulation.
LEADMALE:Blanche, what do you say? I say, go and have a good time.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Blanche, that was sweet of you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Dorothy's a good friend.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, who knows? Maybe this guy will turn out to be cute.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, I'm Jerry.
SUPFEMALE:Is Dorothy Zbornak here? Uh Uh I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, you stop that.
LEADMALE:You are not Dorothy Zbornak.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
OTHERMALE:All right, all right, but I am a Petrillo, and I've been known to make princes and kings leave their wives and palaces and dance the bossa nova.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, what does that mean? I think it means today is placebo-pill day.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to bed.
SUPFEMALE:This is all very confusing.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I'm supposed to meet a Dorothy Zbornak at this address at 7:30 for a dinner date.
OTHERFEMALE:So which one of you really is Dorothy Zbornak? I am Dorothy's best friend, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I'm filling in for her because she's dead.
OTHERMALE:Morning, Blanche.
SUPMALE:How was your date last night? Ha! How was my date last night? I woke up alone.
SUPFEMALE:That's how my date was last night.
OTHERMALE:He didn't open my car door.
OTHERMALE:He did not escort me into the restaurant, didn't pull out my chair, and then, when the check came, he made me pay half the bill! What did I ever do to deserve that? Sounds to me like you put out before dinner again.
LEADFEMALE:She loves you Yeah, yeah, yeah She loves you Yeah, yeah, yeah "Yeah, yeah, yeah," you call that music? "Hidy hidy ho," now that's music.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, even you can't spoil my good mood.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what a glorious day.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you must have had a great time at Beatlemania last night.
SUPMALE:Fabulous.
LEADFEMALE:It was just like seeing the Beatles.
LEADFEMALE:And the fans? Oh! They went crazy.
OTHERMALE:They were screaming and jumping up and down just like it was the '60s.
LEADMALE:I mean, everyone except me.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I had a fabulous time, but I managed to retain my dignity.
LEADMALE:Morning, blokes.
OTHERMALE:He followed me home, Ma.
OTHERMALE:Can I keep him? Can I, huh? Dorothy, what's going on here? Ma, this is Don.
SUPFEMALE:Don, my mother.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, Don plays George in Beatlemania.
LEADFEMALE:And Paul when Ernie's sick.
LEADFEMALE:Well, good for you.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy? What the hell are you doing with this loser? Ma, he is not a loser.
LEADFEMALE:He's a wonderful and gifted musician.
LEADMALE:I know this sounds odd, but when he was on stage, our eyes met and it was Well, it was It was kismet.
LEADMALE:Suddenly, we were spiritually-connected soul mates.
LEADMALE:And then you threw your underwear at me, didn't you, love?  So sue me.
SUPFEMALE:I just got caught up in the moment.
LEADMALE:And then, afterwards, we went for coffee, and then, one thing led to another, and we wound up here.
LEADFEMALE:Well, is that so bad? I can't believe you.
SUPMALE:Are you actually standing here, telling your own mother you had sex with a complete stranger? No, but it was an incredible simulation.
OTHERFEMALE:Blanche, I have to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:What? Do I owe you gas money? Let me get my purse.
LEADFEMALE:No, please let me explain the way I acted last night.
LEADFEMALE:My wife died two years ago.
SUPMALE:I really haven't dated since then.
OTHERFEMALE:I wanted to get back into the swing of things, so I read up on what modern women want.
LEADFEMALE:You know, equality, pay their own way.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess it's all got me confused.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Jerry.
SUPMALE:Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.
LEADFEMALE:Come over here.
OTHERMALE:Now, let me clear up any confusion you might have.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want to be treated as your equal.
SUPFEMALE:You don't? I want to be treated a lot better than you.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, really.
SUPFEMALE:Like a goddess who likes to go bar hopping.
LEADMALE:So what do you say, Blanche? Go out with me again.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I do hate breaking in widowers.
SUPMALE:Actually, I feel more like a schoolboy.
SUPMALE:I guess I could go out with a schoolboy.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:She loves you Yeah, yeah, yeah She loves you Yeah, yeah, yeah She loves you 
OTHERMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah That's Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Really dodged a bullet, didn't you? Girls, I have great news.
LEADFEMALE:I finally convinced Don to quit Beatlemania.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't that wonderful? Dorothy, you're 60 years old and breaking up fake rock-and-roll bands.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to think about that.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, will you stop it? Thanks to me, Don can now perform his own songs.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you know what that makes me? Yoko Zbornak? His muse.
LEADFEMALE:His muse.
SUPFEMALE:Well, actually, his old lady.
LEADMALE:Don't you think I know what this is all about? It's about that British Invasion that's been going on in your bedroom.
SUPMALE:Ma, this is about art and--and love and inspiration, and you make it sound dirty.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Girls, I have a question, a vital question.
LEADMALE:I want you to think long and hard before answering.
LEADMALE:Am I ugly? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I've always thought of myself as ravishing, but is something changing? Is there Is there, all of a sudden, something disgusting and unattractive about me? Yes.
SUPMALE:Now, you cut it out, you old worm woman.
SUPFEMALE:What's wrong, Blanche? I'm in love.
OTHERMALE:That's what's wrong.
SUPFEMALE:I am desperately, completely, helplessly in love with Jerry.
SUPMALE:Nobody since George has made me feel this way, and I just hate it.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Oh, I don't even know if I can say this.
OTHERMALE:He won't touch me.
SUPFEMALE:Five dates and not even a kiss.
LEADFEMALE:Just when I finally meet somebody who can make me happy, just when I need it the most Oh, I can't believe I'm about to say this.
SUPMALE:Blanche Devereaux has lost her sex appeal.
SUPMALE:They're always the last to know.
SUPMALE:What are you looking for, Blanche? Batteries.
LEADMALE:You know, I bought one of those subliminal self-esteem tapes, but my batteries are dead.
SUPMALE:Oh, you don't need those trendy tapes, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I do when I need a shot of self-esteem? Yeah, you put on that dopey "It's okay to be me" sweatshirt, go lock yourself in the bathroom, and then, like a moron, kiss yourself silly in the mirror.
SUPMALE:And I guess I'll be back in there again tonight.
LEADMALE:Oh, Sophia, do you know where any batteries are? Oh, you make me sick.
LEADFEMALE:I am home, dear, dear friends.
LEADFEMALE:What a glorious night! Dorothy Zbornak, I just hate you.
SUPFEMALE:There you go again, rubbing it in, how I'm having a sex drought and you're having a bumper crop.
SUPFEMALE:And I'm expecting more rain.
LEADMALE:Now you just stop that.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, think about it.
SUPFEMALE:Would it really be so bad if you and Jerry just had a platonic relationship? Rose, I already have friends I don't have sex with.
OTHERFEMALE:You guys.
LEADMALE:Oh, what am I gonna do? Listen, girls, don't one of you have a story about some man who wouldn't sleep with you? Golly, I sure don't.
LEADFEMALE:Stop it.
SUPMALE:I have a story, a story that'll end all stories.
LEADMALE:Oh, Rose, please.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:No, please, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:All right, but, honey, make it fast.
LEADMALE:Ten words or less.
SUPFEMALE:All right, but your curiosity is gonna be so piqued, you'll beg for more.
SUPFEMALE:Just spit it out, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:When was it a man refused to sleep with you? The time I was radioactive.
LEADFEMALE:How 'bout you, Sophia? Well, there was that time Warren Beatty passed up the chance to sleep with me.
SUPMALE:So, Rose, you say you were radioactive?  Oh, Jerry, how nice of you to stop by.
SUPMALE:Why'd you ask me to pick you up at a motel? They're having a cast party for Beatlemania at our house, and the last time I looked, Ringo was hanging over the toilet singing Help.
SUPMALE:Oh, I can understand that.
LEADFEMALE:I was in the band in high school.
SUPFEMALE:We went crazy at away games.
SUPFEMALE:I remember once when a guy Yeah, yeah, yeah, get in here.
LEADMALE:Interesting place, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:But it's so bright.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, here, let me dim the lights a little.
OTHERFEMALE:How 'bout I make us a little drink before we leave? Well, maybe one.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Huh.
OTHERMALE:I wonder how this thing works.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, just like The Jetsons.
LEADMALE:Now, let's just sit ourselves down here and have a little bubbly.
LEADFEMALE:You know what goes great with champagne? Me.
LEADMALE:We seem to be missing a chair, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes, so we are.
LEADMALE:Well, let's see what I can do to fix it.
SUPFEMALE:Fixed it.
LEADMALE:My God, Blanche, this bed is vibrating.
LEADFEMALE:It better be at these prices.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, I don't think any of this was a very good idea.
LEADFEMALE:I know what you need, some music.
LEADMALE:You need some nice, soothing music.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want any music.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE: Blanche!  Oh, no, a mirror! Oh, now you're getting into the spirit of things.
LEADMALE:No, I'm not.
OTHERFEMALE:How do you turn this thing off? Well, I don't know.
SUPMALE:I never tried to turn it off.
LEADFEMALE:My goodness!  Oh, forget it.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know what you were trying to accomplish, Blanche, but it didn't work.
LEADFEMALE:It didn't work at all.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, Jerry.
SUPMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:There's been a mistake.
SUPFEMALE:I had no idea what kind of place this was, I swear.
LEADMALE:Ms.
LEADFEMALE:Devereaux, nice to see you again.
OTHERMALE:I'm stunned.
OTHERMALE:I'm-- I'm completely stunned.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, what's wrong? How was Don's debut? A disaster.
SUPFEMALE:What can you say about a show by an ex-fake-Beatle that began with I've Got to Be Me and ended with Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting? What the hell was that man doing up there? Was it as bad as that? Had it been a fight, they would've stopped it.
SUPFEMALE:Did he do any of his own material? Oh, he did his own material, all right.
LEADMALE:A Tribute to Dorothy.
LEADMALE:"Dot, Dot, what a girl I got.
LEADMALE:" The last words I heard as I sprinted to my car were, "When we shower together, we don't have to turn on hot.
SUPFEMALE:" I guess I just feel a little silly right now.
SUPMALE:Could I have transferred my love for the Beatles to this one man who plays a Beatle? Could I have been so shallow as to have fallen in love with a persona, and--and not the person? Oh, Ma, I need support now.
SUPFEMALE:Please, honey, no jokes, no I-told-you-so's.
LEADFEMALE:Of course not, Dot.
LEADMALE:"Dot, I've got to trot.
LEADFEMALE:" Hey, listen to me.
LEADMALE:I'm a Beatle.
LEADMALE:I am nothing but a cheap, tawdry slut.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell me.
OTHERFEMALE:Is it Blanche? I really want to thank you for coming over, Jerry.
LEADMALE:Actually, I wasn't going to, Blanche, but I figured this explanation's got to be a pip.
SUPMALE:Explanation? No, no, no, none of those.
LEADMALE:I just wanted to apologize for tonight and say, I hope we can still be friends.
LEADMALE:Sure, Blanche.
LEADMALE:But there's something I need to know.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you find me attractive? Are you kidding? Blanche, you're one of the most attractive women I've ever met.
OTHERMALE:But five dates! Five dates you haven't laid a finger on me.
LEADMALE:You haven't tried to sleep with me once.
LEADMALE:Sleep with you on the fifth date? Boy, talk about your fast track in the '90s.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, maybe I should explain something to you.
OTHERMALE:I dated my high school sweetheart for years.
SUPFEMALE:We married right out of school, and we were both virgins on our wedding night.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you were makin' a funny.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I'm just frozen back in the old days of courtship.
OTHERFEMALE:Remember when we went to the movies last week?  When you didn't say a word to me, didn't even try to kiss me good night? The way I remember it, you looked so beautiful I felt awkward and tongue-tied, like a teenager.
SUPMALE:I was afraid to kiss you.
LEADMALE:Afraid of a little old kiss? Hey, to me a first kiss is still the sexiest thing in the world.
LEADFEMALE:Get out of here.
