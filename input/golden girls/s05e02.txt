LEADMALE:I have heart palpitations.
LEADMALE:I can't concentrate.
LEADMALE:I forget things.
LEADFEMALE:I I get confused.
SUPFEMALE:Well, now I know what my destiny is, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna be a novelist.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, I don't believe you're sick, but you do.
SUPMALE:Girls, I have writer's block.
SUPFEMALE:It is the worst feeling in the world.
SUPFEMALE:Try ten days without a bowel movement sometime.
LEADMALE:Everybody thinks I'm crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I am.
LEADMALE:There's nothing wrong with you, Dorothy, except what happens to all of us.
LEADMALE:In case you haven't noticed, you're not 30.
LEADMALE:Dorothy could be dying and they just don't know it.
SUPFEMALE: Dorothy, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Don't smash the Play-Doh.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:Well, as far as doctors go, you've certainly seen the best.
SUPMALE:The best don't exist anymore.
LEADMALE:The best are dead.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't know about that.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:You're the exception, Harry.
LEADMALE:I didn't mean you.
SUPMALE:So do you think I'm crazy too? Dorothy, I think you're very sane.
SUPFEMALE:Just because a doctor hasn't found something doesn't mean there isn't something there.
LEADMALE:Are you serious? How come you know that and they don't? First of all, I know you.
SUPFEMALE:You're a stable person.
OTHERMALE:If you say you're sick, you probably are sick.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I want you to see Michael Chang.
LEADMALE:He's a virologist on staff here at the hospital.
SUPFEMALE:There are all kinds of diseases we didn't know about before.
SUPMALE:Look at Lyme disease.
LEADFEMALE:Harry, am I gonna die? I'm afraid so.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you really think so? Sooner or later, I guarantee it.
LEADFEMALE:Unless, of course, the Japanese come up with something.
LEADMALE:There you go.
SUPMALE:Here's his name and number.
LEADFEMALE:My God, what handwriting doctors have.
SUPFEMALE:I can't even read this, and I just wrote it Here it is.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Oliver.
SUPMALE:How are you gonna know it's not chicken soup? We don't keep chicken soup here.
OTHERMALE:We only have vegetable soup.
LEADFEMALE:If that looks like vegetable soup, you're in a lot of trouble.
SUPMALE:How are you gonna know it's mine? Because I'll put your name on it.
OTHERMALE:How old are you? Too old for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Has he been your doctor ever since you were little? He's not my doctor.
OTHERMALE:He's my friend.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, Oliver, Oliver! The bottle, please.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, Harry.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:I can't tell you what it means to have someone like you believe me.
LEADFEMALE:Give me that.
OTHERFEMALE:That's not his.
OTHERMALE:He had Buddy Kline do it for him.
OTHERMALE:This is a proxy? He'll do it in his own bed, but there's something about doing it in a public place.
LEADMALE:Kinda like sex.
SUPMALE:Maybe where you come from.
LEADMALE:Rose, what the hell are you doing? I'm making omelets for us without yolk so we don't get too much cholesterol.
OTHERFEMALE:That leaves these yolks, which I hate to throw out, so I thought we'd give them to the homeless.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Give them egg yolks.
LEADFEMALE:They'll die of heart attacks.
LEADFEMALE:They won't need homes.
LEADFEMALE:Your heart's in the right place, Rose, but I don't know where the hell your brain is.
LEADFEMALE:Morning.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, you look terrific.
OTHERFEMALE:Where are you going? To see that specialist that Harry recommended.
SUPMALE:Wipe off your makeup.
LEADFEMALE:What? You look too healthy.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe that's why they don't believe you.
SUPMALE:You don't look sick.
LEADMALE:She should go.
SUPMALE:They'd believe her.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, you look terrible.
LEADFEMALE:What day is this? I've been up for 72 hours.
LEADFEMALE:I had a breakthrough.
SUPFEMALE:I discovered a new form of writing.
LEADMALE:I will go down in history.
LEADFEMALE:First I wrote all day, then I tore it all up, and then that night it came to me, and the words poured forth like liquid from a stream.
LEADMALE:It was almost a mystical experience.
OTHERFEMALE:Somebody else was writing this.
OTHERMALE:Who? Everyman.
SUPMALE:This is everyman's work.
LEADFEMALE:It's all gold.
LEADFEMALE:Just open it anywhere and the magic will touch you.
LEADMALE:But I'm so tired.
LEADMALE:I must sleep.
LEADMALE:And I cannot sleep.
SUPMALE:I am too tired to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:I will never sleep again.
LEADMALE:I may die from this.
SUPFEMALE:What am I gonna do? My God, I'm hallucinating.
OTHERMALE:I see little balls of sunshine in a bag.
LEADMALE:Does this mean something? Those are egg yolks, Blanche.
LEADMALE:My brain's gone.
LEADFEMALE:My body is limp with exhaustion.
LEADMALE:I suppose all the greats knew this feeling.
LEADFEMALE:And the thing is, after all this I've decided not to sell my book.
SUPMALE:It's too good to sell.
LEADMALE:They can publish it after I'm dead, like Vincent van Gogh.
SUPMALE:Van Gogh was a painter, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever.
LEADFEMALE:It's all the same thing.
SUPMALE:We're all artists.
LEADFEMALE:We're all misunderstood.
SUPMALE:He cut off his hair.
LEADMALE:Maybe I'll cut off mine.
LEADMALE:He cut off his ear.
LEADMALE:I have too many earrings.
LEADFEMALE:We gotta go.
LEADMALE:I hate to leave.
SUPMALE:I've never seen a show like this before.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:I hope he finds something wrong with you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I don't mean something wrong wrong.
LEADFEMALE:I mean something wrong so you know you're right when you know there's something wrong and you haven't been wrong all along.
LEADMALE:My God, I can't even understand people when they speak anymore, I'm so tired.
SUPMALE:What'd she just say, Dorothy? Was that a poem? Rose, make her lie down.
LEADMALE:I do try.
LEADMALE:I try, but I just pop right up again like one of those clowns you hit.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll never rest.
SUPFEMALE:I'll never rest again.
SUPFEMALE:Have a good time, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Buy me a present.
SUPMALE:I'll make you some nice hot milk and then we're gonna pile you into bed.
LEADMALE:Rose, you're my friend so I'm gonna let you read a few pages, but you have to give me your word you won't tell anyone.
LEADFEMALE:Your word.
SUPMALE:Of course.
LEADFEMALE:And then will you sleep? Whatever.
LEADFEMALE:I can trust you, I know I can.
LEADMALE:You're from Minnesota.
LEADMALE:People from Minnesota are honest.
LEADMALE:They don't lie.
LEADMALE:What could you possibly find to lie about on a farm? Must be some state.
LEADFEMALE:Lots of lakes and nice, pale people.
SUPMALE:I'd drown myself.
LEADFEMALE:Read, Rose.
LEADMALE:Don't talk.
SUPFEMALE:I must publish a guide to go with my book.
OTHERMALE:It's too full of references people could not possibly understand.
SUPFEMALE:It will be taught in universities.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, what is this? Yellow eyeballs are staring at me.
LEADMALE:Those are egg yolks, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Blanche, you are exhausted.
LEADMALE:You have to sleep.
SUPFEMALE:To sleep, perchance to dream.
LEADMALE:My God, what a wonderful line.
SUPMALE:Oh! I'm getting so good I can't stand it.
SUPFEMALE:I ought to write that in my book, that line.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think, Rose? What page are you on? To tell the truth, I don't understand any of this.
LEADMALE:It doesn't seem to make any sense.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't make sense? Since when are you a literary critic, Rose Nylund? I'm not.
SUPMALE:You're from Minnesota.
LEADFEMALE:What have you read, for God's sake? Silas Marner? Paul Bunyan? Nothing.
LEADMALE:You know nothing.
LEADMALE:People from Minnesota are considered well-read if they get through the Sears catalog.
LEADMALE:Give me back my book.
SUPFEMALE:This is why Hollywood won't get it either.
SUPMALE:I will not have my words coming out of Glenn Close's mouth.
LEADFEMALE:I'd rather die.
OTHERMALE:Come on, Blanche.
LEADMALE:We're gonna get you to bed.
LEADFEMALE:But it's my duty to the public.
SUPFEMALE:No, I must have it published.
LEADMALE:It's my duty.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God, I'm so tired.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, you can sleep right here, honey.
LEADMALE:Tell me a story, Rose.
OTHERMALE:That always puts me to sleep.
SUPFEMALE:It works every time.
LEADFEMALE:Just tell me one of your boring stories.
OTHERFEMALE:OK.
LEADMALE:I want you to know I'm crazy about Chinese people.
OTHERMALE:Ma.
LEADFEMALE:It's a compliment.
LEADMALE:I am.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Petrillo.
LEADFEMALE:Chinese people revere the elderly.
LEADFEMALE:In this country we throw away anything that's old.
LEADMALE:But you people don't.
LEADMALE:That's a beautiful thing.
LEADMALE:You also have the most gorgeous hair in the world.
LEADFEMALE:Even when it's humid.
LEADMALE:Ma, please, let Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Chang read.
LEADMALE:It's OK, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Zbornak.
LEADFEMALE:I'm finished.
SUPMALE:You've seen some wonderful doctors, but I really can't agree with their findings.
SUPFEMALE:There are new diseases arising all the time
OTHERFEMALE:things we don't necessarily have tests for
OTHERMALE:but that doesn't mean the diseases don't exist.
SUPMALE:See how terrific the Chinese are? With the most terrific food.
SUPMALE:Tasty, but not fattening.
SUPMALE:I don't care what anyone says.
LEADMALE:I don't get hungry an hour later.
OTHERMALE:Ma, let Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Chang finish.
LEADMALE:I love Chinese checkers.
SUPFEMALE:It's much better than plain checkers.
LEADMALE:And chopsticks
LEADMALE:what a great idea.
LEADMALE:Who knows what fork to use at a dinner party? Chopsticks, you don't feel like an idiot.
OTHERMALE:Ma, enough! Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Chang, please.
LEADMALE:Well, I think that you are sick.
LEADFEMALE:I think you have something called chronic fatigue syndrome.
LEADMALE:It's fairly recent.
LEADMALE:There are many theories, but most of us believe it's a virus.
SUPMALE:It just has not been identified yet.
LEADFEMALE:The man's a genius.
LEADMALE:By the way, I loved Flower Drum Song.
OTHERFEMALE:Doctors just kept telling me I was depressed.
LEADMALE:Depression can make a person feel tired, but it doesn't start suddenly, give you swollen glands, sore throat and all the other symptoms.
LEADMALE:Now, there are certain blood tests, which we'll do, and if those results are abnormal that combined with the exclusion of the other diseases will compose a profile that actually thousands of people fit.
SUPFEMALE:So I really have something real? I would say you most certainly do.
OTHERMALE:We should have our answers in a couple of weeks.
SUPFEMALE:How long will it last? I mean, will it go away? Does it get worse? Does anyone die from it? Well, no one has died from it.
LEADFEMALE:We don't know how long it lasts.
SUPMALE:Some people recover in months, some still have it after ten years, but that happens in other diseases as well.
OTHERFEMALE:You take multiple sclerosis.
SUPFEMALE:Some people have 20-year remissions, others wind up in wheelchairs.
LEADMALE:There are variations.
LEADFEMALE:You're a genius.
LEADMALE:All your people are brilliant.
SUPFEMALE:The Chinese invented pasta, you know.
LEADFEMALE:We take credit for it, but we just added oregano.
LEADMALE:Well All I can say at this point is try to adapt to it.
LEADMALE:Rest when you need to, eat well, eliminate stress if you can.
SUPFEMALE:Right now there is no cure, and no one thing that relieves symptoms in everyone.
LEADFEMALE:Right now I'm afraid you'll just have to live with it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, why didn't they tell me, all those doctors I saw? I'm sure some of them weren't familiar with it.
SUPFEMALE:The ones who have heard about it sometimes have trouble believing it exists, since they're not able to see it under their microscopes just yet.
LEADMALE:Those colleagues of mine, unfortunately, tend to blame the victim.
SUPMALE:I can't tell you what a relief this is.
SUPMALE:I'm sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Are there any other questions that I could answer for you? Not now, not that I can think of.
LEADMALE:Maybe later.
OTHERMALE:Right now I can't even think straight.
LEADMALE:If there are no more questions, I'll order some blood work I have a question.
SUPMALE:Of course, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Petrillo.
SUPFEMALE:When I order at Fung Chow's and say no MSG, do they really put it in anyway? I don't believe it.
LEADMALE:Another rejection.
LEADMALE:And this one isn't even personal.
SUPMALE:It's a form letter.
LEADMALE:They just filled in my name at the top, see? Oh, I'm so upset.
LEADMALE:I put everything into this, Rose, all of me, I held nothing back.
LEADFEMALE:Then to have some snotnosed little kid from Harvard send me a form letter, oh! I'm so mad I could scream.
LEADMALE: That's the first time I ever heard anybody say "I'm so mad I could scream" and actually do it.
LEADFEMALE:It's like saying, "I laughed all the way to the bank.
OTHERMALE:" I never saw anybody do that either.
SUPMALE:I did all this work, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:I worked so hard.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I know you did, Blanche.
SUPMALE:All I ever wanted was to be special.
LEADMALE:I thought this would do it.
SUPMALE:I thought I'd publish a novel and I'd be special.
SUPFEMALE:'Course, I've always been special because of my looks, but they won't last forever.
OTHERFEMALE:I have to be realistic
LEADFEMALE:another 20 or 30 years.
SUPFEMALE:My face and body might start to go and then I'll have nothing to make me special.
LEADFEMALE:That's not what makes a person special, Blanche.
LEADMALE:You're special because you're a kind, decent, loving individual with a wonderful heart and a beauty that comes from your soul.
SUPFEMALE:That's that Minnesota crap again about the meaning of life.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Blanche, what else is there besides love and kindness? How about fame and fortune? That doesn't bring happiness.
LEADFEMALE:Like hell it doesn't.
LEADMALE:You know, I'm getting sick of you knocking Minnesota.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe we're not as sophisticated as Miami, maybe we don't have French boutiques and valet parking and face-lifts for Christmas vacation, but we have friends and family and a sense of community and caring, and that's pretty special.
SUPFEMALE:And our people are special too.
LEADMALE:And if we have farms, that's great.
LEADFEMALE:Without farms, you couldn't eat, and without eating, you wouldn't be able to go on a diet, and if you couldn't do that, what would you do for the rest of your life? Was I harsh? Ladies, drinks? Champagne.
LEADMALE:The best you have.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, that's so expensive.
OTHERMALE:Shut up, Rose.
SUPMALE:This is my treat.
OTHERFEMALE:It is a celebration.
LEADMALE:What are we celebrating? My daughter found out she has a debilitating disease.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! And it has a name.
SUPMALE:I am thrilled.
SUPMALE:We all are.
LEADMALE:Well, of course.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:Champagne it is.
LEADFEMALE:I can't tell you what a relief it is to just be sick, not sick and crazy, and to know what I have, and that a lot of other people have the same thing.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like the name.
LEADFEMALE:I think it ought to have a better name.
OTHERFEMALE:That's what Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Chang said.
OTHERMALE:Chronic fatigue syndrome makes it sound like I'm just a tired person when it is so much more than that.
LEADMALE:I think they should name it after you.
OTHERFEMALE:Zbornak syndrome.
SUPFEMALE:Zbornak syndrome.
LEADFEMALE:That sounds like a chess move.
LEADMALE:Devereaux's disease has a nice ring to it.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my God.
SUPMALE:Oh, it was just a thought.
OTHERMALE:It's him.
LEADMALE:Who? I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:I saw him first.
SUPMALE:Who is it? Where is he? It's Dr.
LEADMALE:Budd, the neurologist I saw in New York.
SUPFEMALE:The one who told me I was just getting old and to go see a psychiatrist.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, don't make a scene.
LEADMALE:Order without me.
LEADFEMALE:Dr.
OTHERFEMALE:Budd? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:You probably don't remember me, but you told me I wasn't sick.
LEADMALE:Do you remember? You told me I was just getting old.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I really don't Remember.
LEADMALE:Maybe you're getting old.
SUPFEMALE:That's a little joke.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I tell you, Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Budd, I really am sick.
SUPFEMALE:I have chronic fatigue syndrome.
OTHERMALE:That is a real illness.
LEADFEMALE:You can check with the Center for Disease Control.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, I'm sorry about that.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm glad.
LEADFEMALE:At least I know I have something.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure.
LEADFEMALE:Well, nice seeing you.
LEADMALE:Not so fast.
LEADMALE:There are some things I have to say.
SUPMALE:There are a lot of things that I have to say.
SUPFEMALE:Words can't express what I have to say.
LEADFEMALE:What I went through, what you put me through I can't do this in a restaurant.
OTHERMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:But I will.
LEADMALE:Lewis, who is this person? Look, miss Sit.
OTHERMALE:I sat for you long enough.
LEADFEMALE:Dr.
OTHERMALE:Budd, I came to you sick
LEADMALE:sick and scared.
SUPFEMALE:And you dismissed me.
LEADMALE:You didn't have the answer.
LEADMALE:Instead of saying, "I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know what's wrong with you," you made me feel crazy, like I had made it all up.
LEADFEMALE:You dismissed me.
LEADFEMALE:You made me feel like a child, a fool, a neurotic who was wasting your precious time.
LEADMALE:Is that is that your caring profession? Is that healing? No one deserves that kind of treatment, Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Budd, no one.
LEADMALE:I suspect, had I been a man, I might have been taken a little bit more seriously and not told to go to a hairdresser.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I am not going to sit here anymore-- Shut up, Lewis.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know where you doctors lose your humanity, but you lose it.
LEADFEMALE:If all of you at the beginning of your careers could get very sick and scared for a while, you'd probably learn more from that than anything else.
OTHERMALE:You'd better start listening to your patients.
SUPMALE:They need to be heard.
SUPMALE:They need caring, they need compassion.
SUPFEMALE:They need attending to.
SUPFEMALE:Someday, Dr.
OTHERMALE:Budd, you're gonna be on the other side of the table, and as angry as I am, and as angry as I always will be, I still wish you a better doctor than you were to me.
SUPFEMALE:Are you all right? I feel better than I have felt in a long time.
OTHERFEMALE:To my friends who made being sick a little easier because they cared.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh! This is the best champagne I've ever tasted.
LEADFEMALE:It should be.
LEADFEMALE:It's $430 a bottle.
SUPMALE:Rose, I can't afford that! You did say the best.
LEADMALE:Rose, for heaven's sake, you should have told me what it was.
LEADFEMALE: Ma, what am I gonna do? Just calm down.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll show you an old Sicilian trick.
OTHERFEMALE:This is how I grew up poor and managed to eat in the best restaurants in all of Italy.
LEADMALE:Watch.
OTHERMALE:Look, learn.
LEADFEMALE:It's awful! Swill! Is there a problem? You're supposed to take off your socks before you step on the grapes.
SUPFEMALE:Taste this.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, dear.
SUPMALE:Ladies, I'm terribly sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get you a new bottle.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:It lingers on the palate.
SUPFEMALE:We won't be able to drink champagne for weeks.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, at least let us pay for your meal.
LEADMALE:If you insist.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Now it's a celebration! 
SUPMALE:
