LEADFEMALE: Is this 6151 Richmond Street?
SUPMALE:Ma, what's the matter?
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, thank God it's you.
LEADMALE:I broke my glasses at the mall and I can't see a thing.
LEADFEMALE:It took it took me six hours to find my way home.
LEADMALE:Ma, if you couldn't see, why didn't you call me to come get you? I tried to, but every time I put in a dime and dialed, a condom popped out.
SUPMALE:I got five in my pocket.
OTHERFEMALE:Here, Dorothy.
OTHERFEMALE:A lifetime supply.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, which one of these necklaces looks better with this dress? This gold chain or the pearls? They both look nice, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not sure about the pearls.
OTHERMALE:Do pearls nestled in the ample cleavage revealed by my low-cut gown somehow might suggest I'm nothing but a cheap, easy, good time? They might.
OTHERMALE:That settles it.
LEADFEMALE:Pearls it is.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, you look terrific.
LEADFEMALE:You look like you lost 15 pounds.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's your thigh.
LEADMALE:I thought it was part of the couch.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, try to remember, gravy isn't a beverage.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, Ma broke her glasses.
OTHERMALE:She can't see a thing.
LEADMALE: Hi, Rose.
LEADMALE:Hi, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter, honey? Something wrong? Yes no.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess yes and no.
LEADMALE:Honey, what is it? I found out this morning I'm gonna be a mother again.
LEADMALE:We've been over this a hundred times.
LEADFEMALE:You cannot get pregnant using the toilet at the mall.
SUPMALE:I bet it's a boy.
LEADMALE:You're carrying really high in the front.
SUPMALE:I'm not having a baby.
LEADFEMALE:I'm getting a baby.
LEADFEMALE:I got a telegram that my Uncle Hingeblotter had passed away and left me custody of his baby.
LEADMALE: Oh, my God.
SUPFEMALE:What are you gonna do? I'm not sure.
LEADFEMALE:I've always dreamed of the chance to be a mother again, but it's a big responsibility.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it sure is.
LEADMALE:I'm not sure I could raise another baby at my age, and I'm far younger than you.
LEADMALE:And prettier.
SUPFEMALE:Not that prettier has anything to do with it, but I just am.
LEADMALE:You know, Rose, I have a confession to make.
LEADFEMALE:I have always dreamed of the chance to raise another baby.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Dorothy, if you're lucky, maybe someday one of your uncles will drop dead.
SUPFEMALE:What I mean, Rose, is that if you decide to raise this child, I think I'd like to help you.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Wait a minute, if you both want to raise this child, why, I might even consider it myself.
LEADFEMALE:But you said you didn't want to be a mother again.
SUPFEMALE:But I meant by myself.
LEADFEMALE:As long as you all are around to change its diapers and clean up when it spits up and pees, I'd love to be a mother again.
LEADFEMALE:Are you girls sure you wanna do this? Look, I know it's gonna be a lot of work, but oh, it'd be worth it to hear a baby's laugh around the house.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, let's do it.
SUPFEMALE:What do you say, Ma? What choice do I have? If I say no, I'll be back at the home building log cabins out of popsicle sticks.
LEADFEMALE:Then it's settled.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call the lawyer and tell him to bring the baby.
LEADMALE:Did he say if it's a boy or a girl? He didn't say, but it must be one or the other.
OTHERFEMALE:You been watching PBS again, Rose? Dorothy? Dorothy, I'm going to my bedroom.
SUPFEMALE:I want to lie down for a while.
LEADMALE: Ma? Dorothy, who the hell parked a Buick in my bedroom? Sophia! Rose, what are you doing in the bathroom? Ma, this is the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy, if this is the kitchen, I'm poaching an egg in the toilet.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, look at this old picture I found.
LEADFEMALE:That's me at 15, standing next to my Uncle Hingeblotter.
SUPFEMALE:Who's the other guy? That's my uncle's half-
OTHERMALE:Inkeblotter.
LEADMALE:Oh, girls, we have a big problem.
OTHERFEMALE:What is it, Blanche?
OTHERFEMALE:Well, we're all women.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Sure we are, Dorothy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, shut up.
LEADFEMALE:I'm reading the Spock book on baby care, and he says it's important for a child to have a male role model during its formative years.
SUPMALE:What are we gonna do?
SUPFEMALE:We'll wear Yankee caps and scratch our behinds after every beer.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Blanche, we don't have anything to worry about.
SUPMALE:If we give that baby love and attention and understanding, it'll turn out fine.
LEADMALE:That's beautiful.
OTHERFEMALE:Besides, what does Spock know about raising babies? On Vulcan, all the kids are born in pods.
LEADMALE:Rose, I know this is a long shot, but, did you take much acid during the '60s? 
LEADMALE:Is, uh, Rose Nylund here?
LEADFEMALE:I'm Rose Nylund.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm Chester T.
SUPMALE:McRainey, legal counsel to your late Uncle Hingeblotter.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we've been waiting for you.
SUPMALE:Did you bring the baby?
SUPMALE:I brought him.
LEADMALE:Him, did you hear that, girls? Does he look anything like me? Uh, well judge for yourself.
OTHERMALE:Come on, Baby.
LEADMALE:Come on, Baby.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, uh, maybe just a little around the eyes.
LEADFEMALE:What in hell is going on here? This is Baby.
SUPMALE:Five-time blue ribbon winner at the Minnesota State Fair.
OTHERMALE:This sweet little thing was your uncle's pride and joy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God.
OTHERFEMALE:That's the cutest baby I've ever seen.
LEADMALE:Ma, it's a pig! You were no great looker when I brought you home from the hospital.
LEADMALE:I loved you anyway.
LEADMALE:Well, he sure is cute.
SUPMALE:Come here, Baby.
LEADMALE:Oh, I haven't had a pig as a pet since I was a little girl.
LEADFEMALE:Just forget that.
LEADMALE:I want that filthy beast out of my house now.
LEADFEMALE:Fine, your cousin Gunther will be happy to take Baby, as well as the $100,000 that comes along with him.
LEADFEMALE:I beg your pardon? Uncle Hingeblotter was a very rich man.
LEADMALE:And he loved this pig dearly.
SUPMALE:That's why he left you $100,000 to make sure Baby would be well taken care of.
SUPMALE:Well, I'd take care of him for free.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, shut up, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:How long does Rose have to take care of this pig before she gets the money? Well, as long as he lives.
LEADMALE:Oh, forget it.
LEADFEMALE:I'd split the money with you girls.
OTHERMALE:Forget it.
OTHERFEMALE:How long does a pig live?
LEADFEMALE:25 years.
SUPFEMALE:Forget it.
SUPMALE:How old is this pig? Welcome, Baby! Hi, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Ma.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, how do you make your voice do that? Here, honey, I picked up your new glasses.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank God.
SUPFEMALE:Now I can see.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:These are no good.
LEADMALE:The wrong prescription?
SUPMALE:No, the wrong frames.
LEADFEMALE:I specifically asked for old lady smoky green.
SUPFEMALE:These are black.
LEADFEMALE:I look like Buddy Holly.
LEADFEMALE:There you are.
LEADMALE:You get in the kitchen and eat your slop before I spank that little pink fanny.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I'm going.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sorry, that's the way they used to call us for dinner at the home.
LEADMALE:Go on, Baby, go on.
LEADMALE:Go on.
OTHERMALE:Rose, I thought we decided that that pig was gonna stay in the pen out back.
LEADMALE:He didn't like it there.
SUPFEMALE:It was too confining.
SUPMALE:Oh, but Baby's a free spirit.
LEADMALE:A wanderer.
SUPMALE:A rebel.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, in a lot of ways he reminds me of Jimmy Dean.
SUPFEMALE:The actor or the sausage? You know, Dorothy, I was thinking, how wonderful it is to have a pig living here.
SUPMALE:This morning I was all snugly warm under the covers and I opened my eyes and there was Baby, fast asleep at the foot of the bed, like a sweet angel.
LEADMALE:That is sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, how long do you think it'll be before the pig is dead?
LEADFEMALE:Did Baby do something wrong?
SUPMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:Not unless you count that when he burps, it smells like four burning tires.
SUPFEMALE:Girls, I'm just so mad.
SUPFEMALE:That pig tore up my nightgown last night.
OTHERFEMALE:The people you date are from foreign countries.
OTHERFEMALE:They play by different rules.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm talking about Baby.
LEADFEMALE:I never should've let that barnyard beast in my house in the first place.
LEADMALE:He ruins my clothes, smells up the whole house, and he likes to watch me take a shower.
LEADFEMALE:He's a pig.
LEADFEMALE:There's no accounting for taste.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't realize Baby was such an inconvenience.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call my relatives and see if somebody can take him off my hands.
SUPFEMALE:Him, and the $100,000.
SUPMALE:Remember, Blanche, the pig is gonna drop any day.
LEADFEMALE:Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Come back here, honey.
LEADMALE:I guess maybe I was a little bit too hasty.
SUPMALE:Baby isn't really that much trouble.
LEADMALE:Heck, this is an old nightgown, and, well, he is kind of cute.
SUPFEMALE:He's not the first pig to watch you shower, and that's my last pig joke, I swear it.
LEADFEMALE:Then it's all right? He can stay? Well, of course he can, honey.
SUPMALE:That's great.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll go tell him the good news.
SUPFEMALE:I won't be able to get off work tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Can somebody else give Baby his lunch?
LEADMALE:Don't look at me.
SUPFEMALE:I won't do it.
LEADMALE:Why not? What you two are doing is making me sick.
LEADFEMALE:Degrading yourself by living with a filthy animal.
LEADFEMALE:And for what? Money.
LEADMALE:It's humiliating.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want any part of it.
LEADMALE:What if we cut you in?
LEADMALE:What time does he eat? Girls, girls! Come quick, Baby just collapsed.
LEADMALE:Now I know how Johnny Carson feels.
LEADFEMALE:Baby.
LEADFEMALE:Poor Baby.
SUPMALE:This morning he was so full of life, and now he looks just terrible.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, honey, don't torture yourself.
LEADMALE:Now, Baby is very, very old.
LEADMALE:Whenever one of God's creatures outlives its normal life expectancy, why, it can go any minute.
LEADFEMALE:Would you mind not looking at me when you say that? Does anybody know where the thermometer is? Sure, in the medicine cabinet.
OTHERFEMALE:Why? I wanna take Baby's temperature.
OTHERFEMALE:Although, I'm not sure what the normal temperature is for a pig.
LEADMALE:I know a ham turns out nicely at 325.
LEADMALE:Ohhhh.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Rose, I don't know what I'm talking about.
OTHERMALE:I'm delirious with grief.
LEADMALE:So, what are you gonna do with your share of the money? Oh, come on, Blanche, the pig isn't dead.
SUPMALE:He's sick.
SUPMALE:The money never even crossed my mind.
LEADMALE:Then what were you doing with these EF Hutton brochures? Ma, you took those out of my purse.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, they fell out when I was taking out a 20.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure not putting my money into stocks and bonds.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, this is found money.
SUPFEMALE:This is fun money.
SUPFEMALE:This is hot beaches and sweaty men money.
LEADFEMALE:Getting naked and rolling around on the ground money.
SUPMALE:Even your money has more fun than I do.
LEADFEMALE: Boy, it's great being rich.
LEADMALE:I can't believe we spent so much money that we don't have yet.
SUPMALE:Relax.
LEADMALE:When I looked in on Baby this morning, he was a half hour away from Sizzilean.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh! Well, Rose Nylund, shame on you.
LEADFEMALE:With a gentleman caller in the middle of the afternoon.
OTHERFEMALE:He's not a gentleman caller.
SUPMALE:He's a veterinarian, here to see Baby.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Uh, how is Baby, doc? I read in Newsweek they ran him out of Haiti.
SUPFEMALE:How is Baby? Not very well, I'm afraid.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think he has much time left.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's too bad.
LEADMALE:Tragic.
LEADMALE:Terrible.
SUPMALE:But there's hope!  What? There's really nothing wrong with Baby, physically.
LEADFEMALE:He has a mental problem.
LEADMALE:Four grown women decide to live with a pig, and he's the one with the mental problem? Well, I wouldn't exactly call it a mental problem.
SUPFEMALE:When you take an animal out of its natural environment, it's not uncommon for it to have a hard time adjusting to new surroundings.
LEADMALE:Are you trying to tell us that that pig is dying of homesickness? In a way, yes.
SUPMALE:My recommendation is to get him back to the farm.
SUPFEMALE:Once he's home, he should do a lot better.
LEADMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE: Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I guess we have no choice.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call my relatives in Minnesota and make arrangements to send Baby to the farm.
LEADMALE: No! I'm just as disappointed as you are! Oh, it's been great having a pig living in the house.
LEADFEMALE:But we can't jeopardize Baby's health, the doctor said so.
LEADMALE:Please, what does he know? He's not a real doctor.
LEADMALE:He makes his living sticking thermometers up a cat's behind.
LEADMALE:Well, I don't know, he seemed pretty sure.
LEADMALE:Honey, doctors make mistakes, too.
SUPMALE:I still think we ought to send Baby home.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, do you realize how far away home is? Baby is sick.
SUPMALE:Why, the plane trip alone could kill him.
OTHERMALE: Even if he did get home safely, who knows what kind of care he'd get? Nobody loves that pig as much as you do.
LEADFEMALE:As much as we all do.
SUPMALE:If you all think it's best, I guess he should stay.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you for caring so much.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to know that poor, sick, helpless pig in there appreciates what you're doing, too.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna look in on Baby.
LEADFEMALE:You're the best friends I've ever had in my life.
LEADFEMALE:I feel terrible.
SUPMALE:I feel miserable.
LEADMALE:Let's go shopping.
LEADMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Oh, Blanche, Blanche.
LEADMALE:I am so glad you came back.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I have to talk to you.
LEADMALE:I have to talk to you, too.
LEADMALE:And it's about the money.
SUPFEMALE:That's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about.
LEADFEMALE:I have been so worried.
LEADFEMALE:The way we've been spending this money is wrong.
LEADMALE:Blanche, I could not agree with you more.
LEADMALE:Honey, I've been up half the night worrying about how foolish we've been, spending all that money on silly little things that we don't need.
LEADFEMALE:I am so relieved.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I just knew you would agree that combining our money to buy one big thing was the best idea.
LEADMALE:I just hope you like it in light blue.
OTHERMALE:Like what in light blue?
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:We'll be right out, Sophia.
LEADMALE:Blanche, that's a Mercedes.
OTHERMALE:I know it.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you just love it? It's ours.
LEADMALE:Blanche, you don't understand.
LEADMALE:I wanted to give up the money and send Baby home.
LEADFEMALE:No, you can't do that.
SUPFEMALE:We lied to Rose.
LEADMALE:We tricked her into jeopardizing the life of an animal, just to make a fast buck.
SUPFEMALE:We have to tell her the truth.
LEADMALE:I cannot let you do this.
SUPMALE:Get out of my way.
SUPMALE:I want that car.
SUPMALE:I will give you anything.
LEADFEMALE:We have to tell Rose the truth.
LEADMALE:I'll give you one of my sons.
LEADFEMALE:I have given this a lot of thought.
SUPMALE:I have had four kids, I have never had a Mercedes.
LEADFEMALE:What do you say? Which one do you want? Biff, Doug, Skippy? No, don't take Skippy, he's got asthma.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, this has gone far enough.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose? Honey, I want to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:Now don't bother Rose.
SUPFEMALE:She's busy.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's okay.
SUPMALE:I was just thumbing through the old family album.
LEADMALE:Here's a picture of Baby when he was younger.
LEADMALE:Wasn't he an impressive sight? Oh, yes, Rose.
SUPMALE:But then again, who isn't when he's caught relieving himself and eating dinner at the same time? Well, I think Baby looks a whole lot better today.
SUPMALE:A pig isn't supposed to be green, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh! Rose, I have a confession to make.
LEADFEMALE:When I said I thought Baby shouldn't go back to the farm, I wasn't thinking of him.
LEADMALE:I was thinking of myself.
SUPMALE:I was acting out of greed.
LEADMALE:I wanted the money.
OTHERMALE:Dorothy, I am shocked! Oh, so am I! I can't believe you lied to me.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, now don't be too hard on her, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:She may have been doing it for the wrong reason, at least the decision was right because Baby is better off here.
LEADMALE:Why ya'll looking at me like I'm a murderer? This pig is dying because he's old and sick.
SUPMALE:I refuse to even entertain the notion that he's slipping away because he's homesick for this godforsaken place.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:What's going on? He recognizes the picture of Uncle Hingeblotter's farm.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God! He is homesick.
OTHERMALE:I'm a murderer.
LEADMALE:I'm nothing but no-good money-grubbing trash.
SUPMALE:Baby, forgive me.
SUPMALE:Blanche, get a hold of yourself.
SUPMALE:Rose, I apologize.
SUPMALE:Rose, so do I.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Rose, can you ever forgive us? Rose.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, please.
LEADFEMALE:We're really sorry.
SUPMALE:Well, I might forgive you, but I can't speak for Baby.
LEADMALE:Is there something we can do to smooth things over? Well A kiss on the nose might be a nice gesture.
LEADMALE:Oh, I never can stay mad at you silly gooses.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? Oh, Ma, Baby's going home.
LEADFEMALE:May he rest in peace.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, Baby isn't dead.
LEADMALE:We've decided to send him back to the farm and give up the money.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Let me get this straight.
LEADMALE:We lived with a filthy pig in our house, bought a bunch of stuff on credit we can't afford, and now we're gonna kiss off 100,000 bucks because the pig is homesick? That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes life really bites the big one.
LEADMALE:Hi, Sophia.
LEADMALE:I see you finally got your new glasses.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I also got these to beg for spare change on the corner.
OTHERMALE:That is enough! Now look, we have to stop this moping around.
OTHERFEMALE:So we don't have the money anymore.
LEADMALE:I mean, we still have a great deal to be thankful for.
LEADFEMALE:We live in a lovely home, we have our health and each other.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you the truth.
LEADFEMALE:When we had the money, we did crazy, ridiculous things.
OTHERMALE:To be honest, I'm glad it's gone.
OTHERFEMALE:Girls, my cousin who took Baby just sent us a letter.
SUPMALE:Please let there be cash in it! I can't stand being poor another day.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:"Dear Rose.
LEADMALE:Just wanted to let you know Baby arrived safely.
LEADMALE:He was really happy to be back on the farm.
SUPFEMALE:His last 36 hours on this good earth were" What? What? Baby died.
LEADMALE:Poor Baby.
SUPMALE:Poor Baby! Well, I guess he wasn't homesick after all.
OTHERFEMALE:Just old.
LEADMALE:And for this I fought my way back from a stroke? I cannot believe this.
OTHERFEMALE:If he had stayed here another lousy day and a half, we'd be rich!  What was that? Oh, no! Oh, they've come to tow away our Mercedes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, now I am really depressed.
LEADMALE:I never even got a chance to ride in it.
LEADFEMALE: Boy, what a great idea.
LEADFEMALE: Isn't it luxurious?
LEADMALE: And the engine's so quiet.
SUPFEMALE: There's Alice Feinbaum.
LEADMALE:Look at her, green with envy.
LEADMALE:Eat your heart out, Feinbaum!
LEADFEMALE:
