LEADFEMALE:Hi, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:What the hell are you doin' home? I thought you had a beauty appointment.
OTHERMALE:I did.
SUPFEMALE:They finished early.
LEADMALE:On Christie Brinkley, they can finish early.
LEADMALE:You need every minute they can spare.
LEADMALE:Now get back there.
LEADFEMALE:He's here, isn't he?
LEADMALE:Who?
SUPMALE:Who? Rocco.
LEADMALE:Rocco.
SUPMALE:Let me refresh your memory.
LEADFEMALE:The man you met in the police lineup.
LEADFEMALE:I was there to identify the guy who stole my purse.
LEADMALE:Rocco was there on a trumped-up charge.
LEADMALE:Ma, they caught him on a billboard spray-painting something obscene on Spuds MacKenzie.
SUPMALE:The dog they use in those ads is really a female.
SUPMALE:Rocco was just making Spuds anatomically correct.
LEADMALE:Ma, I'm telling you, the man is bad news.
LEADMALE:He has no job.
LEADMALE:He gambles.
LEADMALE:What kind of future does he have? Future? Please.
SUPMALE:He's 85.
SUPFEMALE:The man's got so little time, he only uses the ten-items-or-less line at the supermarket.
LEADFEMALE:Look who came to say hello, Rocco.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Always a pleasure.
LEADFEMALE:Nice seeing you.
LEADMALE:Cut the crap and put out the stogie, Rocco.
LEADFEMALE:I like your style.
LEADFEMALE:Right suit, right haircut, voice a little higher, you could pass as Frank Nitti.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell are you talking about? A little higher, I think you got it.
LEADFEMALE:You really knew Frank Nitti? Well, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Frank Nitti, Dutch Schultz, Al Capone.
SUPMALE:Are you saying you were in the Mob? I ran Detroit.
LEADMALE:The marathon.
LEADMALE:He ran the Detroit marathon.
LEADMALE:Come on, come on.
SUPFEMALE:We're in the middle of a hand.
OTHERFEMALE:Four of a kind.
LEADFEMALE:Beat that.
LEADMALE:Straight flush.
LEADMALE:Pay me, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, what are you doing?
LEADFEMALE:Losing.
OTHERFEMALE:It's strip poker.
SUPMALE:That's it! Game's over.
LEADMALE:Who do you think you are? Donald Trump? You don't own this casino.
LEADMALE:She's always telling me what to do.
OTHERFEMALE:My daughter treats me the same way.
SUPFEMALE:Kids.
SUPMALE:Once they're over 50, they think they know everything.
SUPFEMALE:I cannot believe my mother is hanging with that cheap hood.
SUPMALE:You mean Rocco?
SUPMALE:No, Rose.
LEADMALE:I mean Spiro Agnew.
LEADFEMALE:He gave her a highway contract instead of an ID bracelet.
LEADMALE:Of course I mean Rocco!
LEADMALE:I think he's kinda cute.
OTHERFEMALE:He is not cute.
LEADFEMALE:He is a bad influence.
SUPMALE:Since Ma started seeing him, she's on the phone all day, stays up all night.
SUPMALE:Yesterday, she came home with NyQuil on her breath and his surgical stockings in her pocket.
OTHERFEMALE:Dorothy, can I ask you something? I don't know what it means.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't like the possibilities.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted to ask, do you think Blanche has been picking on me lately? I haven't noticed.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Must you always be so cheerful, you empty-headed Mary Poppins knockoff? Let me know if you notice anything.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, what's with you and Rose? I'll tell you what.
LEADFEMALE:This.
LEADFEMALE:What is it?
LEADMALE:Rose's diary.
LEADMALE:What are you doing with it?
LEADFEMALE:It was lying on the table.
SUPFEMALE:I picked it up, and the lock just popped open just like this.
LEADMALE:Listen to 
LEADMALE:"Dear Diary, I don't know how much longer "I can stand living with these two pigs.
LEADFEMALE:"Moving in with them seemed like a good way "to save money, but it's getting out of hand.
OTHERFEMALE:"If one isn't keeping me awake with her squealing, the other one is belching in my face.
LEADMALE:" You do that sometimes, Dorothy.
LEADFEMALE:After you've had a Denver omelette.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you know this is a real invasion of Rose's privacy.
LEADMALE:And it's a Spanish omelette.
SUPMALE:Doesn't it bother you?
LEADMALE:Not if I take a little Gelusil.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, the diary.
OTHERMALE:No! No! Not at all.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm really shocked that you read it.
OTHERMALE:You're not interested to hear other things she had to say?
LEADMALE:Not in the slightest.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Well, fine.
LEADMALE:Suit yourself.
OTHERFEMALE: Use the knife.
LEADMALE:Blanche, what are you doing? I thought we agreed we weren't gonna read any more.
SUPMALE:That was only because we couldn't pry the lock off again.
LEADMALE:And then I remembered we had these pliers in the tool drawer.
OTHERFEMALE: Gangway.
LEADMALE:Old people comin' through.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, what is all this stuff here? This isn't stuff.
SUPFEMALE:This is my life.
SUPFEMALE:Why are you bringin' your life into our livin' room? There have been robberies at Rocco's building.
OTHERFEMALE:He asked me to store his valuables.
LEADMALE:We don't have enough space.
LEADFEMALE:I have plenty of space in my room.
LEADMALE:Come on, Rocco.
LEADMALE:When you go in there, I want you to leave the door open.
OTHERMALE:Yes, Mrs.
SUPMALE:Cleaver.
LEADMALE:Hi, girls.
OTHERMALE:Gee, what's my diary doing here next to a pair of pliers? Whatever it is you're thinkin', it isn't true.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Then George Bush isn't married to his mother.
SUPMALE:Boy, that was easier than I thought.
OTHERFEMALE:This lock has been tampered with.
LEADFEMALE:You two read my diary, didn't you?  That's despicable.
LEADMALE:I will tell you what is despicable, missy.
LEADMALE:Some of the things you wrote.
SUPMALE:This is my book for my eyes.
LEADMALE:You have no right to invade my privacy.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, you said some terrible things.
LEADMALE:I thought we were friends.
LEADMALE:We used to be.
LEADMALE:We're not anymore.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:What's wrong?
LEADMALE:I have a problem.
SUPMALE:I'll say.
LEADMALE:You should never have stopped using that depilatory.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, I'm up here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Ma, Rose isn't talking to me.
LEADFEMALE:Enjoy it while it lasts.
SUPFEMALE:Now, good night.
SUPMALE:Honey Hi, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Can I talk to you? No.
LEADMALE:Go away.
LEADFEMALE:But I can't sleep.
LEADFEMALE:It's because Rose isn't talkin' to me.
SUPMALE:I could care less.
LEADMALE:Get out.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERMALE: Sophia? I'm not in.
LEADMALE:Wait for the beep.
SUPFEMALE:Then leave a message.
OTHERFEMALE:Beep.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:This is Rose.
LEADMALE:I Rose, shut up and get in here.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I see you're with two double-crossing ex-friends.
OTHERMALE:I'll come back later.
SUPFEMALE:What do you think this is, the 7-Eleven? I'm not open all night.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, we feel terrible.
LEADMALE:What have you done?
SUPMALE:We're really very sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry about what?
SUPFEMALE:How can I ever trust you again?
LEADMALE:Trust who? Let's not talk about trust after the terrible things you wrote.
SUPFEMALE:Will someone please tell me?
LEADMALE:Blanche and I read Rose's diary.
LEADFEMALE:And she wrote some terrible things about us.
LEADFEMALE:About you? I didn't write anything about you.
LEADMALE:I didn't even know you when I kept that diary.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? That was my 4-H diary.
SUPMALE:I kept it one summer when I raised two pigs for the county fair.
SUPMALE:You kept a diary about raising two pigs? You know another way to get a 4-H pig diary badge? Oh, my God! There's been a terrible misunderstanding.
LEADFEMALE:What do you say we forget the whole thing? No way.
LEADMALE:I'm really mad.
LEADMALE:It's late, I'm tired, so listen up.
LEADMALE:You gonna tell us a story? No.
LEADMALE:Shadow puppets.
SUPFEMALE:See? An elephant eating a peanut.
LEADMALE:Happy? Of course I'm gonna tell a story.
SUPFEMALE:Picture 
LEADFEMALE:Morocco, the '30s.
LEADFEMALE:The 1930s? No, 30 degrees.
LEADFEMALE:Do I look like Willard Scott? Of course the 1930s.
SUPFEMALE:Three close friends are haggling over a Camel.
LEADMALE:How many humps? None! I'm talkin' about a cigarette.
LEADFEMALE:It was the last one.
SUPMALE:Well, anyway What does this have to do with the diary? Suddenly I'm on Nightline.
LEADFEMALE:I was just tryin' to tell a story.
LEADFEMALE:There's no point, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never be able to forgive them.
LEADMALE:Isn't there anything we can do? No.
SUPFEMALE:Absolutely not.
LEADFEMALE:I'm unyielding on this.
SUPFEMALE:Can't you think of anything that'll make us be friends? No.
OTHERFEMALE:This time, you've crossed the line.
SUPFEMALE:If I can't trust you, then we can't be friends.
LEADFEMALE:The relationship is over.
SUPMALE:Good-bye.
LEADFEMALE: I got out in the hall, and I missed you guys already.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, let's be friends.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I love you guys.
SUPMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:Now get out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, let's not fight anymore.
LEADMALE:Fine! Get out! The best friends I've ever had.
OTHERMALE:I said get out!  Look at all that money! Gosh, there's thousands.
SUPFEMALE:Where did this come from? Rocco's bag.
SUPMALE:Where did Rocco get all this money? I don't know, but the next time we go to the Colonel, I'm getting all white meat and a biscuit.
SUPFEMALE:I do not believe this.
LEADMALE:There are thousands here.
LEADMALE:Ma, how could Rocco have this much money? I'm as confused as you.
SUPFEMALE:He had that satchel when he went to the bank.
SUPMALE:Sophia, maybe you better tell us exactly what happened.
SUPFEMALE:When we got to the bank, he told me to keep the motor running.
LEADFEMALE:Five minutes later, he ran out.
LEADMALE:Did you think of asking why he was running? No.
OTHERFEMALE:The man is taking diuretics for a prostate problem.
LEADMALE:His whole life is a 50-yard dash.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, he robbed a bank.
LEADMALE:I'm calling the police.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:He didn't rob that bank.
SUPFEMALE:I know Rocco.
SUPMALE:He's a good man.
SUPMALE:A decent man.
LEADFEMALE:An honest man.
OTHERFEMALE:And not a bad kisser.
LEADFEMALE:How do you explain this money? Are you a treasury agent? It's circumstantial evidence.
OTHERFEMALE: Hello? Rocco, we were talking about you.
SUPFEMALE:A funny thing just happened.
LEADFEMALE:We found thousands of dollars in your bag, and we were kinda wondering where it came from.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, right.
LEADMALE:That clears it all up.
LEADMALE:See you later, then.
LEADMALE:He robbed the bank.
LEADFEMALE:Anybody hungry? You're not calling the police? The man told you he robbed a bank! He also told me he had a good reason.
OTHERFEMALE:He did it for love.
LEADFEMALE:Gee.
LEADFEMALE:The most any man ever did for me was getting all his sheep to lie down in a field and spell out my name.
SUPMALE:Ma, call the police.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Rocco needs to talk to me.
LEADFEMALE:He's coming over.
LEADMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:I'll call the police.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never speak to you again.
LEADFEMALE:But, Sophia, Rocco did admit he robbed a bank.
LEADFEMALE:It's my fault.
SUPFEMALE:He thought he could keep me if he had money to buy me expensive things.
SUPMALE:I gotta convince him to turn himself in.
SUPMALE:If he doesn't, I'll go to the police myself.
LEADMALE:It's the last time I let a man toy with my affections.
LEADMALE:From now on, it's strictly physical.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I've never been fond of Rocco, but it's obvious that he really cares about my mother.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, one thing's for sure, that Rocco is a romantic, and there aren't many men like him left.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, what was the most romantic thing a man ever did for you? Oh, that's easy.
LEADMALE:When George and I were courting and it was getting to the intimate stage, we went for a date in his big old Packard.
OTHERMALE:Halfway home, we ran outta gas.
SUPMALE: It was dark, it was cold.
LEADFEMALE:So we held each other close.
LEADMALE:Both of us knew, right then and there, this was the night.
SUPFEMALE:Sure enough, pretty soon the windows were all fogged up from the heat generated by our bodies.
LEADMALE:After we were married, I told George that the only thing that could've made that evening more romantic was if we'd had candles and wine and a big blanket.
OTHERFEMALE: So, on our tenth anniversary, George fired up the old Packard, and we drove along the same route, and we ran out of gas on exactly the same spot.
LEADMALE:George said, "Blanche, why don't you look behind that tree?" So I did, and there was a basket
OTHERFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:With candles and wine and two long-stem glasses and a big blanket.
LEADFEMALE:We had a perfect evening.
SUPMALE: Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh, that is beautiful, Blanche.
SUPMALE:Isn't it a shame you didn't look behind the tree the first time? What's the most romantic thing a man did for you, Dorothy? Oh, well, the most romantic thing was when Stan proposed.
SUPMALE:He took me to a very expensive restaurant, and I went to the powder room, and when I returned, there was an open bottle of Dom Perignon and two filled glasses.
LEADMALE:And we clinked the glasses in a toast, and Stan gave me a coy smile, and I winked at him, and then I just downed the champagne in one gulp.
LEADMALE:And it didn't go down smoothly.
OTHERMALE:Later, Stan told me that he put my engagement ring in the bottom of the glass.
SUPFEMALE:Aw.
OTHERMALE:Aw.
LEADFEMALE:It turned up three days later.
SUPMALE:Where'd it turn up, Dorothy? On the Home Shopping Network, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:But, Dorothy, you have to admit, it was very touching what Rocco did for Sophia.
SUPFEMALE:If it hadn't been a felony.
LEADFEMALE:Still, it goes to show you, hair may turn gray, your skin may wrinkle, but you're never too old for romance.
SUPFEMALE:So, don't give up, girls.
SUPFEMALE:Ssst! Rocco.
SUPMALE: Sophia I came to get ya.
LEADMALE:Forget it.
LEADFEMALE:You kissed this pleasure palace good-bye when you stole that money.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:I've got a brand-new Harley-Davidson in the driveway.
LEADMALE:I didn't know you could ride a motorcycle.
OTHERFEMALE:Can't.
OTHERFEMALE:I pushed it all the way here from the dealership.
LEADFEMALE:I'm exhausted.
LEADMALE:We're gonna have to take a cab.
LEADFEMALE:Hold your horses.
SUPMALE:We got something to talk about.
SUPFEMALE:First, how did you rob that bank? Aahhh.
SUPMALE:It was a magnificent heist.
LEADMALE:I moved with catlike precision.
OTHERFEMALE:Rocco, you're in big trouble.
LEADFEMALE:By tomorrow, we'll be south of the border, sparkling skies above us, tropical breezes blowing across our bodies.
LEADMALE:Sophia, you with me? No.
LEADMALE:Sophia, I'm disappointed.
LEADFEMALE:Not half as disappointed as I am.
SUPFEMALE:I admit, at times, your stories about being a big-shot gangster seemed colorful to me, but I figured you weren't that guy anymore.
LEADMALE:And if you are, you're not for me.
LEADMALE:I wish you'd have told me that before.
LEADMALE:Sophia, I have some confessions to make to you.
LEADMALE:I was never a big-shot gangster.
LEADMALE:I was never a big-shot nothin'.
OTHERFEMALE:All I was was an assistant cook at chowder house in Bayonne, New Jersey.
SUPFEMALE:Not the kind of fella you're used to goin' with.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't wanna lose ya.
LEADMALE:That's why I made up the bank robbery.
LEADFEMALE:$45,000 was my life savings.
LEADFEMALE:I thought with that money I could I could treat you like you oughta be treated.
LEADMALE:Like a queen.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe this.
LEADMALE:I can't believe it either.
OTHERMALE:There's a gate.
LEADMALE:I could've got a hernia comin' over the wall! Wait.
OTHERMALE:I've messed everything up.
SUPMALE:I'll just get out of your life.
SUPMALE:What I can't believe is that you went through all this.
SUPFEMALE:Rocco, you always treat me like a queen.
LEADMALE:Come here.
LEADMALE:Okay, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:You landed on sports.
LEADFEMALE:Here's the question.
LEADFEMALE:"What famous football player wore panty hose" Doug Curloff, Tampa Bay Bucs, New Year's Eve.
OTHERFEMALE:We were at the Holiday Inn near the airport.
OTHERFEMALE:The complete question is, "wore panty hose in a magazine advertisement?" How the hell would I know? To see a man in panty hose, I don't have to buy a magazine.
LEADFEMALE:Joe Namath.
SUPMALE:Your turn, Rose.
OTHERMALE:Okay, music history.
LEADMALE:Here goes.
LEADFEMALE:"What famous Mozart composition, "completed in 1787, is a serenade in G "for two violins, viola, cello, and double bass in four movements?" Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
SUPFEMALE:How did you know that? They always play it during the chases on The Bugs Bunny-Roadrunner Show.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:There was There was this one where Elmer Fudd was chasing Bugs, and he stuck his gun down a hole that Bugs had painted Excuse me, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, could I see the rule book?
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Ah! What say we call it a night? Ready to go to bed, Dorothy? No.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna wait up for Ma.
LEADMALE:She's out with Rocco.
SUPMALE:Oh, Dorothy, Sophia'll be fine.
LEADMALE:She's a grown woman.
LEADMALE:You can't wait up every night.
OTHERFEMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:She's capable of taking care of herself.
LEADFEMALE: Hello? Ma! Do you know what time it is? You're what? Oh, the hell you are! Listen, you are not spending the night at Rocco's.
SUPMALE:Look.
SUPFEMALE:As long as you live under our roof, you will abide by our rules! I should do what to myself? What? Hello? Hel Dorothy, is Is your mother all right? Oh, fine.
OTHERMALE:She does something wrong, suddenly she's my mother.
SUPFEMALE:
