LEADMALE:Who's the letter from, Ma?
OTHERMALE:Joanne Pescatore.
OTHERMALE:She's coming to Miami for a visit.
OTHERFEMALE:Joanne Pescatore? Didn't she own that candy store down the street in Brooklyn?
SUPFEMALE:That was Jeanette Passadano.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Then who was Joanne Pescatore? How the hell should I know? This letter's for Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, why are you reading Rose's mail? Because all you got were bills.
OTHERMALE:Listen to this.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me if you think Joanne's a lesbian.
LEADFEMALE:Ma.
LEADMALE:Hi, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Guess what I've got.
LEADMALE:A friend who's a lesbian? Better.
LEADMALE:I picked up our weekly lottery tickets.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, girls, it's been such a glorious day.
LEADMALE:All afternoon I was in the mood for leather and I finally found exactly what I wanted.
SUPMALE:Fine, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Just make sure his motorcycle doesn't block the driveway.
SUPMALE:Can we save the chat for later? If we hit the jackpot, I wanna live to spend it.
LEADMALE:What jackpot?
LEADMALE:I picked up our lottery tickets.
OTHERMALE:Here we go.
SUPMALE:I forget.
OTHERFEMALE:How does this go again? To win something, you have to get three to match? Right.
LEADFEMALE:If you get three coconuts, you win $100.
LEADMALE:What if you get three palm trees? You don't have three palm trees.
SUPFEMALE:That means you win $10,000.
LEADMALE:Ma, I know what a palm tree looks like.
LEADFEMALE:You also know what a handsome doctor looks like.
LEADFEMALE:It doesn't mean you've got one.
SUPMALE:Sophia, she's right.
LEADMALE:Three palm trees.
SUPMALE:$10,000.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
SUPMALE:We just won $10,000.
LEADMALE:$10,000!
SUPFEMALE:I don't believe it!
LEADMALE:$10,000! Split four ways that's almost $ 2,000 apiece.
LEADMALE: Almost.
SUPFEMALE:Where are you going, Ma?
LEADMALE:To order that cherry red tricycle with the grocery bag sidecar.
LEADFEMALE:Don't laugh.
SUPMALE:You ride one past a shuffleboard court, you got old guys coming out of your hair.
SUPFEMALE:$10,000! God, life is beautiful.
LEADMALE:Now I don't feel so guilty about spending all that money on this leather jacket.
LEADFEMALE:I don't mean to be a party pooper, but it looks like they sold you a jacket that someone returned.
LEADMALE:It's kind of beat-up.
LEADFEMALE:No, Rose, that's the way it's supposed to look.
SUPFEMALE:It's an aviator jacket.
SUPFEMALE:And now I can afford some accessories for it.
LEADMALE:Like a purse?
LEADMALE:Like an aviator.
LEADFEMALE:Here, let's just put that lucky ticket in my jacket pocket for safekeeping till tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:I think we ought to go out to dinner to celebrate.
LEADMALE:What a great idea.
SUPMALE:I'll go freshen up.
LEADFEMALE:Me too.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get my purse.
LEADFEMALE:Where's everybody going?
SUPMALE:Dinner.
LEADMALE:Get ready.
SUPFEMALE:I am ready.
SUPFEMALE:I'm always ready.
LEADMALE: You do that at 82.
SUPFEMALE:That, and carry hard candy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, I'm Dave from Lincoln Hospital.
LEADFEMALE:That's nice.
LEADFEMALE:If my blood pressure goes up, you'll be the first person I call.
LEADMALE:No, wait! I'm from the thriftshop.
SUPFEMALE:Somebody called about donating some old stuff.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, right.
SUPFEMALE:These boxes over here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:This beat-up old thing must be for you too.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Goodbye.
SUPMALE:Goodbye.
OTHERFEMALE:OK, let's celebrate.
LEADMALE:We should order champagne.
LEADFEMALE:And caviar.
SUPMALE:Yahoo! We're rich! It has to be here somewhere.
LEADMALE:It's not in the laundry room closet.
SUPMALE:It's not in my bedroom, but I knew that.
OTHERMALE:I am positive you left it on the couch.
SUPFEMALE:We gotta find that jacket.
SUPMALE:It's driving me crazy.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:I wasn't gonna say anything, but since it's kinda my fault, I'll pay for a new jacket.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean it's your fault?
LEADFEMALE:Do you know where the jacket is? What did you do with it, Ma? Stand back.
SUPMALE:I know how to use this thing.
LEADFEMALE:Spill it, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:I'm scared.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do anything you say.
SUPFEMALE:Where is the jacket, Ma?
SUPMALE:I gave it to the thriftshop.
SUPFEMALE:You what?
SUPMALE:Let's get down there before they sell it.
LEADMALE:What's the big deal? It was an old jacket.
LEADMALE:We put the winning lottery ticket in the pocket.
OTHERMALE:Start the engine and open the door.
SUPMALE:I'll jump in at the bottom of the driveway.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, excuse me, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:We are looking for a leather jacket that got mixed up with a box of clothes we donated.
LEADMALE:It was a terrible mistake.
OTHERFEMALE:It was not a terrible mistake.
SUPFEMALE:It was a regular mistake.
LEADFEMALE:A terrible mistake is when you forget A Different World follows Cosby.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I remember you.
LEADFEMALE:I just picked that stuff up a couple of hours ago.
LEADMALE:Then it's still here?
LEADMALE:It must be.
LEADMALE:I just put it out.
LEADMALE:Uh, Michael decided to take this.
SUPMALE:Dorothy, that's our jacket.
LEADMALE:Do something.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, Rose.
OTHERMALE:I left my flamethrower in my other purse.
LEADMALE:Here, let me handle this.
LEADMALE:Listen here.
LEADFEMALE:I would like to have a word with you.
LEADMALE:I paid good money for that jacket and before you walk out of here with it, there's something I want to say.
SUPMALE:What? The zipper sticks a little.
LEADMALE:Pardon.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Would it be possible to try that jacket on? Just for a minute.
LEADMALE:Uh, no time, ma'am.
LEADMALE:Michael has to get to the concert.
OTHERMALE:Look, if you don't mind, I would like to see this Michael.
SUPFEMALE:You and the rest of Miami.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:The entire engagement is sold out.
LEADMALE:Michael.
LEADMALE:Do you know who that is?
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:The guy from Pepsi commercials.
LEADFEMALE:Pepsi commercia Michael Oh, my God! That's Michael J.
LEADFEMALE:Fox!
OTHERFEMALE:Please can we talk to you for a minute?
LEADMALE:Michael, it's very important.
OTHERFEMALE:We won't bother you.
LEADMALE:Michael! Yes, yes, that's right.
SUPFEMALE:It was a winning ticket, but we gave the jacket away.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you very much.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, I'll tell 'em.
LEADMALE:I'm sure they'll appreciate it.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:What did he say? He was in agreement.
LEADFEMALE:It was a miscarriage of justice and we deserve the money.
SUPMALE:Oh! Great.
SUPFEMALE:He also told me I'd called his Chinese restaurant instead of the Lottery Commission.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:He felt so bad, he's giving us free egg rolls the next time we come in.
LEADMALE:Oh, what's the difference? It's over.
SUPFEMALE:If we don't have the ticket, we can't claim the prize.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia, are you all right? You haven't said a word in hours.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm fine.
OTHERFEMALE:I was thinking about what I'd planned with my share of the winnings.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted to get each one of you something special for being so kind and allowing a Ionely old woman to live with you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Sophia.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe if we went to a movie it'd make us feel better.
SUPMALE:Can we afford it?
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, come on, now.
LEADMALE:This is ridiculous.
SUPMALE:We are not poor.
LEADMALE:We thought we had $10,000 and now we don't, but we're no better or worse off than we were 24 hours ago.
LEADFEMALE:If that was a pep talk, it stunk.
OTHERMALE:Look at this.
LEADMALE:There's a celebrity auction to benefit the homeless and they're selling a leather jacket worn by a major rock star at his concert last night.
LEADMALE:Let me see.
LEADMALE:What? Oh, I don't believe it.
LEADMALE:This is it.
LEADFEMALE:This has to be it.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, let's get going.
LEADMALE:We can't go to a charity event like this.
LEADMALE:The auction started 20 minutes ago.
LEADFEMALE:I'm right behind you.
LEADMALE:Hey, those gifts I was talking about, they were more tokens of affection than actual gifts, you know? They're cheap? Just so everyone understands the ground rules.
SUPFEMALE:OK, let's roll.
LEADFEMALE:The bid's 900.
SUPMALE:sold for $900.
SUPFEMALE:Congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:And now, moving along to item number 17.
SUPFEMALE:A leather jacket recently worn in concert by one of the world's leading musical talents.
LEADFEMALE:Get ready.
SUPFEMALE:This is it.
SUPMALE:I have a really dumb question.
OTHERMALE:And I have a box of Chiclets.
LEADFEMALE:What's your point?
SUPMALE:How high do we bid?
SUPMALE:High.
LEADFEMALE:High.
LEADMALE:I mean, even if it costs us $1,000, we'll still have $9,000 left.
LEADMALE:Don't start high.
LEADMALE:We might get it for a couple of hundred.
LEADFEMALE:We'll start at $100 and see how it goes.
LEADMALE:OK, OK, OK.
OTHERFEMALE:And now, may I have an opening bid, please?
SUPMALE:Excuse me?
OTHERMALE:$10,000.
SUPFEMALE:sold for $10,000.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you so much.
SUPMALE:Could I say a few words to the audience? For ten grand they should let him shower with the audience.
LEADMALE:I guess now I'll never get to fly on the Concorde.
SUPMALE:I'll never get to buy that emerald pendant to dangle between my perky bosoms.
OTHERMALE:And I'll never get to buy perky bosoms.
OTHERFEMALE:But what the hell.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing else perks on this body.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we can get the jacket for a minute and grab the ticket out of the pocket.
SUPFEMALE:That's a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:I bet I could use a little friendly persuasion on that gentleman.
SUPMALE:Persuasion? This isn't dinner at the Rainbow Room, this is ten big ones.
SUPFEMALE:Give him whatever he wants.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry.
OTHERMALE:I guess I just didn't realize how much I wanted that money.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, I'm congressman Philip Starr and I've recently been accused of being insensitive to the homeless.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think tonight's sizeable cash contribution should lay those accusations to rest.
OTHERMALE:He doesn't even care about the jacket.
LEADFEMALE:It's a miracle.
SUPFEMALE:This is going to be easy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't take any chances.
LEADFEMALE:Sleep with him anyway.
SUPMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:And as a symbolic gesture to underscore my concern, I've done something very special tonight.
LEADFEMALE:In addition to my sizeable donation, I've just dispatched my top aide to one of many shelters in our community with the jacket I've just purchased.
SUPFEMALE:May it provide warmth and comfort to one of our city's homeless.
SUPMALE: We're screwed.
LEADMALE:Are you sure we're in the right place?
LEADMALE:Mission Street Shelter for the homeless.
SUPMALE:This is where they sent the jacket.
LEADMALE:Kinda drab, isn't it? Blanche, it's a shelter, not the flagship of the Hilton chain.
LEADFEMALE:Kinda reminds me of the Shady Pines Retirement Home, except here the lights in the exit sign work.
SUPFEMALE:What's our plan?
LEADFEMALE:What is this? 
LEADMALE:Impossible? Do I look like Peter Graves? You could if you'd put a rinse in your hair and wear a lighter lipstick like I beg Here, I'll tell you what our plan is.
LEADMALE:Now, there's $10,000 at stake.
LEADFEMALE:To find that jacket and get that ticket we will lie, cheat, threaten and steal if we have t
LEADMALE:Oh, hello.
LEADFEMALE:Anybody got a backup plan? Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't know anyone was here.
LEADFEMALE:I was locking up.
LEADMALE:Father, we desperately need your help.
LEADMALE:Frankly, I'm not sure we have enough beds, but you're welcome to stay.
LEADMALE:Oh, we don't want to stay.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, we do.
LEADFEMALE:We have to, just for one night.
OTHERMALE:There's no need to be embarrassed.
LEADMALE:We're not here to judge, we're here to keep you safe and warm.
LEADMALE:Let me get some pillows.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:This is insane.
LEADMALE:I'm not leaving here without it.
LEADMALE:I'm with Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:We've come this far.
SUPMALE:After we get in, split up and look.
LEADMALE:Here are your pillows.
LEADMALE:The blankets are on the beds and lights out's in just a few minutes.
LEADFEMALE:The beds are right through here.
LEADMALE:Are you gonna tie a bow in that when you've finished wrapping it up? I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I didn't mean to disturb you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a bit compulsive.
SUPFEMALE:It's the Minnesota farm girl in me.
OTHERFEMALE:You're from Minnesota?
OTHERFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:No kidding? So am I.
LEADMALE:Well, what a coincidence.
LEADMALE:Isn't that amazing? St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf.
LEADFEMALE:Ben Wheaton.
LEADMALE:Pleased to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, my name is Rose Nylund.
SUPMALE:I come from St.
LEADFEMALE:Olaf.
SUPFEMALE:I should've known that you weren't a saint.
LEADFEMALE:It's too much to expect a miracle this late in the game.
LEADFEMALE:What happened?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, bedtime, Rose.
SUPMALE:Does that mean we can't talk anymore?
LEADMALE:No, they just like you to stay in your beds.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, darn.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't get to brush my teeth.
LEADMALE:I know how you feel.
LEADFEMALE:I always make sure I brush after every meal.
LEADFEMALE:You wouldn't happen to have a meal on you, would you?
LEADFEMALE:What are you staring at?
LEADMALE:Your purse.
SUPFEMALE:You just be careful, son.
SUPFEMALE:There is a long list of men who bear the scars of trying the wrong thing at the wrong time with me.
SUPFEMALE:Scars, I might add, that are not visible to the general public.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you might have a piece of gum.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Well, I might.
LEADMALE:You want me to take a look? Forget it.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I didn't mean to snap at you like that.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just a little uncomfortable here.
OTHERFEMALE:Helps if you stuff newspapers under the mattress.
LEADFEMALE:That's not what I meant.
OTHERMALE:I was talking about being here at the shelter.
LEADMALE:This is your first time? Oh, lord, it's been ages since I heard that from a man.
LEADMALE:Yes, it is my first time.
LEADMALE:I can give you a few pointers if you like.
SUPMALE:Now, that I've never heard before.
SUPMALE:Are you comfortable, Ma?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Before we leave, I wanna get the model number off this cot.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm hoping Ethan Allen makes one in knotty pine.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, try to make the best of it, OK? We're gonna be here for a while.
LEADMALE:I don't think Blanche or Rose spotted the jacket either.
SUPFEMALE:I don't believe it.
LEADMALE:That's Ida Perkins.
LEADFEMALE:What? That's Ida Perkins.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell is she doing here? Were you kidding me about being from Minnesota? Absolutely not.
SUPMALE:I spent 22 years working the prime noon-to-eight shift at the Minneapolis Excelsior Hotel.
SUPMALE:I don't believe it.
LEADMALE:Where did you live in Minneapolis? Oh, 22 years, lots of places, but my last home was near Bartholomew and Third.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's a lovely neighborhood.
SUPFEMALE:Why did you leave? Well, I liked to entertain a lot, but the cardboard box I was living in was only suitable for small dinner parties.
SUPMALE:Breakfast is cereal and coffee.
SUPFEMALE:They ask for a quarter, but if you don't have it, no one makes a fuss.
LEADMALE:Just make sure you get there early.
LEADFEMALE:A lot of times they run out.
LEADMALE:Well, lovely as that sounds, Kenny, I usually skip breakfast.
LEADMALE:When you're 45, you have to keep an eye on your figure, if you know what I mean.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche, who do you think you're fooling? Oh, all right.
LEADMALE:That's not what I mean.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing in this place? You don't belong here.
LEADFEMALE:I most certainly do.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, it's OK.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just curious.
LEADMALE:See, I don't belong here either.
LEADFEMALE:You don't?
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I'm in graduate school.
LEADFEMALE:I'm undercover, working on my doctorate in sociology.
SUPMALE:I knew it.
LEADMALE:I knew it.
LEADMALE:The minute we started talking, I said to 
LEADMALE:"Now, how could a bright boy like him end up here?" You're more like my own son than you are like those people you see stopping strangers for spare change.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, that explains it all.
SUPFEMALE:Now I feel much better.
OTHERMALE:So you're really a student working on your doctorate.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm really an alcoholic who needs a place to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:What?
LEADMALE:It's true.
SUPMALE:I've already got my doctorate.
LEADFEMALE:We had some great times at the home, didn't we, Ida? We sure did.
LEADFEMALE:Dorothy, Ida was the best bar none at faking an angina attack at dinner so we could swap our nonfat yogurt for real sour cream.
LEADMALE:There wasn't a patient at Shady Pines that didn't bless Ida every time we sat down to eat a baked potato.
LEADMALE:When did you leave the home, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Perkins? Maybe a year now.
LEADMALE:I don't really keep track.
OTHERMALE:Well, what made you decide to leave? Decide? Some things in life you never get to decide.
LEADMALE:Some things just happen.
LEADFEMALE:What happened, Ida? I didn't know
SUPMALE:nobody told me
LEADFEMALE:that it cost money to get old.
LEADMALE:I just figured that was one thing you'd get for free.
LEADFEMALE:It isn't.
LEADMALE:The home cost money, the doctors cost money, medicine costs money.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I always thought it was sad I outlived my whole family, but I never knew it was going to be a punishment.
LEADFEMALE:The hotel business started to slump.
LEADMALE:Hundreds of people got laid off.
SUPFEMALE:I went looking for work, but believe it or not, most businesses aren't anxious to train a 55-year-old black hotel porter.
SUPFEMALE:Go figure it, huh? It's all about pressure from family, from professors, from friends.
LEADMALE:No room to slide.
OTHERFEMALE:Have to be perfect.
LEADMALE:Guess what, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not perfect.
SUPMALE:So they sent me a letter.
OTHERFEMALE:The money was gone.
LEADFEMALE:I asked for some help.
LEADMALE:They gave me some phone numbers.
SUPMALE:The streets were cold in Minnesota.
LEADMALE:It took me nearly three months, but I finally made it to Miami.
OTHERFEMALE:I Will you listen to me, just running on? Tell you what, you tell me your sad story over breakfast.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't survive out there, but I'm learning to survive here.
LEADFEMALE:Which reminds me, hold on to that purse.
LEADMALE:I didn't really want any gum.
LEADFEMALE:I wander now.
OTHERMALE:I don't decide anything anymore.
SUPFEMALE:I wait for things to happen.
OTHERFEMALE:Look for the jacket.
OTHERMALE:I guess.
SUPMALE:Let's split up.
SUPMALE:(# "Brother.

LEADFEMALE:can you spare a dime? Ida, I know it's rough by yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:I count my blessings that I have my Dorothy to look after me, but you can't give up.
SUPFEMALE:People care.
SUPMALE:They really do.
LEADFEMALE:Good people won't let this kind of suffering go on.
LEADFEMALE:You just gotta hang in there till tomorrow.
