LEADMALE:I, Sophia Petrillo, being of sound mind and body, do hereby leave my daughter, Dorothy Zbornak, nothing.
SUPMALE:Sophia! It's a joke.
LEADFEMALE:I'm kidding.
OTHERMALE:Like when I said "sound mind and body.
LEADFEMALE:" Sophia, wills are no joking matter.
OTHERFEMALE:Charlie tried to be funny with his and left everything to Henrietta, our prized cow.
LEADMALE:Well, some lawyer got a hold of the will and represented Henrietta on contingency.
LEADMALE:There I was presenting my side to a jury of her peers.
SUPMALE:It took over six months to get the farm back.
SUPFEMALE:What a terrible story.
LEADFEMALE:I mean it.
OTHERMALE:It's a terrible story.
LEADFEMALE:But you must have been relieved when you won.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:We celebrated with a big, thick steak.
LEADMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, I'm glad you're here.
SUPMALE:Sit down.
LEADMALE:Oh? What is it, Ma? As you know, my child, I'm getting on in years and I've decided it's time for me to settle my estate.
LEADFEMALE:What estate? Your loofah sponge and bus pass? Don't forget the four gold teeth when your father worked at the funeral parlor.
LEADFEMALE:"Perks," he called them.
OTHERMALE:That's the stock you come from.
SUPMALE:I come from grave robbers? Grave robber, entrepreneur.
LEADFEMALE:Potato, potahto.
SUPMALE:We had a family to feed.
SUPMALE:I hated that cow.
SUPFEMALE:I still don't think she should have been awarded the car.
LEADFEMALE:Not that she got to use it.
OTHERFEMALE:Butt out.
LEADMALE:I'm having an important moment with my heir.
LEADMALE:Dorothy, Rose is helping me make out an ironclad will.
LEADMALE:Wait, you're using Rose as a lawyer? I know what I'm doing.
LEADMALE:Every Thursday, I watch La Law.
LEADMALE:That's L.
LEADMALE:A.
LEADMALE:Law.
SUPFEMALE:I wondered why Susan Dey didn't have a French accent.
SUPFEMALE:Girls, what am I gonna do? I got a call from a soldier who just returned from the Persian Gulf.
LEADMALE:Don't fall for it, Blanche.
OTHERFEMALE:Sal didn't come home from World War II till 1951.
LEADMALE:Where was he stationed? In the attic.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, you told me he was in the arctic.
SUPFEMALE:The attic, the arctic.
SUPMALE:Tomato, tomahto.
SUPFEMALE:He had a family to feed.
LEADMALE:Well, anyway, this soldier really did go to the war, and he's gonna be here any minute, and I don't know what to do 'cause I can't remember him.
SUPFEMALE:All he said on the phone was that he had a great time with me the night before he left.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, then it's got to beanybody.
LEADFEMALE: Ah, there's your unknown soldier now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dorothy, would you please get the door? And find out his name.
LEADFEMALE:Blanche, what are you so worried about? The minute you see him, you'll remember.
LEADFEMALE:Rose, he's gonna be standin' up with his clothes on.
LEADMALE:He could be Anybody.
LEADFEMALE:Please, Dorothy? Oh, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Can I come? Sure, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy.
LEADFEMALE:We're going to the living room.
SUPMALE:We don't have much of a life, do we, Dorothy? Dorothy? Dorothy? Now remember, be nice to him.
LEADFEMALE:He hasn't had sex in over a year.
SUPMALE: Look who I'm talkin' to.
OTHERMALE:Hello, is Blanche here? Yes, she is.
LEADMALE:Uh, whom shall I say is calling? This is kind of embarrassing.
LEADMALE:Would you mind telling her Loverboy is here? Nothing would give me greater pleasure.
SUPMALE:Uh, Blanche, Loverboy is here.
SUPFEMALE:Blanche! Loverboy! Not a clue.
LEADMALE:I just got off the plane.
LEADMALE:I haven't even been home yet.
LEADFEMALE:I just couldn't wait to see you, Blanche.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Loverboy.
SUPFEMALE:That's-- That's so sweet, Loverboy.
LEADFEMALE:All those months away I kept saying, "There's a great lady waiting for you back home, Ken.
LEADMALE:" Ken! That's it.
SUPMALE:Of course, Ken.
LEADMALE:Then Ken would turn to me and say, "There's a great lady waiting for you, too, Bill.
OTHERFEMALE:" "Bill"? Bill, he was talking to you, right? Yes.
LEADMALE:Yes, of course.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlings, this is Bill.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess Bill and I should be going.
SUPMALE:I thought we should go back to that same place where we fell in love, Blanche.
LEADMALE:Yes, that's great.
OTHERFEMALE:That'd be wonderful.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:We'll go right back tothere.
LEADFEMALE:We'll just do exactly the same things we did that night.
OTHERMALE:Oh, what a wonderful night that was.
SUPMALE:Bye, girls.
LEADFEMALE:Not a clue.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't this something, Blanche? Do you believe they gave us the same table? Well, why would they seat us separately? I mean, the same table as last time.
LEADMALE:Oh, of course.
LEADMALE:Silly me.
LEADMALE:Oh, and look, even the same chairs.
LEADMALE: Blanche, I have a confession to make.
LEADFEMALE:It's not easy.
LEADMALE:But something happened over there and I think you should know about it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I did keep pretty well up with what went on over there.
OTHERFEMALE:I saw Schwarzkopf on the Bob Hope special.
SUPFEMALE:What I'm talking about is personal, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:I know we said we wouldn't even look at anybody else.
SUPFEMALE:But the first night the sirens went off, I got scared.
LEADFEMALE:And there was this nurse that I talked to.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, how could you, Ben, Bob, uh, Bill? I swear, it didn't mean a thing.
LEADMALE:Was she beautiful? Not as beautiful as you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I--I, too, have a confession to make.
LEADMALE:I got scared, too.
LEADFEMALE:Three, four times a week.
SUPFEMALE:Depending upon how often the phone rang.
LEADFEMALE:You were scared they were calling about me, weren't you, Blanche? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's it.
LEADFEMALE:That's a good one.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if it weren't for your picture, I don't think I'd have made it through.
SUPFEMALE:My picture? You know, it sounds corny, but I put your picture in my locker, and I would look at it every day.
LEADMALE:You don't know how important it is to know that you've got somebody back home, especially when you're thousands of miles away in the middle of a war.
LEADFEMALE:You promised me when I came back, I would be your one and only guy.
SUPFEMALE: Dance? Sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Welcome home, soldier.
OTHERFEMALE:Rose, it's late.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing up? I'm just cleaning up some things on your mother's will.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you mean the legal language? No.
LEADMALE:I spilled some sauce.
SUPMALE:Ma, what are you doing up? Disappointed, huh? If I'm up that means I'm alive, and if I'm alive, it means you can't get your hands on my money.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? You know about the will.
LEADFEMALE:You know if I die you'll be on easy street.
SUPMALE:What did you do, Dorothy, slip cyanide into my mouthwash? Ha, ha! The joke's on you, I don't use it.
SUPMALE:Oh, Ma, come on.
LEADFEMALE:You're just being silly.
OTHERFEMALE:Here, have some tea.
SUPFEMALE:It'll relax you.
OTHERMALE:Nice try, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Rose, you taste it.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, don't! That tea was for my mommy.
SUPMALE:You try to do right by your kids and you end up as the lead story on Hard Copy.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have any idea what she's talking about, or do we have to up her medication? I do know what she's talking about, but I can't tell you.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't violate the attorney-client privilege.
LEADMALE:Especially when we're talking about a sum as large as $35,000.
SUPMALE:"$35,000"? And four gold teeth.
LEADFEMALE:Oops.
LEADFEMALE:Nice going, counselor.
LEADFEMALE:Exactly how close to the television are you sitting when you're watching La Law? All right, Ma, enough.
SUPFEMALE:Now, where did you get $35,000? Did you ever hear of hard work? Well, your brother and sister had to work very hard to send me that money.
LEADMALE:Are you telling me that all these years you were hoarding money while I had to make big, huge sacrifices? I'm not telling you, you're guessing.
LEADMALE:But to be perfectly honest, you're getting warmer.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what a wonderful night.
OTHERMALE:Now that Bill's getting out of the service, we can build a life together.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe with a VA loan we can get a nice little house in the country with a dog, a cat, a station wagon.
LEADMALE:Blanche, you're talking like it's 1945.
LEADMALE:These aren't the best years of your life, these are the last years of your life.
SUPFEMALE:Dorothy, tonight, when I was dancing in his arms, it hit me.
SUPMALE:One minute I was worried about my hair, the next I was in love.
LEADFEMALE:Bill is the most romantic man I've ever known.
SUPMALE:She always says that when they give her a hat.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:Don't start, Rose, okay? Oh, I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:That good morning crack was way out of line.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, it's me.
SUPMALE:I was up all night thinking of how Ma's been hoarding all those checks from Phil and Gloria, while I've had to go without.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now, Dorothy, you really can't blame Sophia for your sex life.
LEADMALE:That's not what I'm talking about, but since you brought it up, yes, I can.
SUPMALE:If I'd had the money, I could have been living in a swinging condo, instead of with I better not say anything till I've had my coffee.
OTHERFEMALE:A slut and a moron.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, it must be decaf.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, pussycat.
SUPMALE:Huh? What's so "pussycat" about it? Do you have any idea of how furious I am with you? All these years I have given up things so that you could have a decent life.
SUPFEMALE:"No, Ma, I don't need new shoes, I want you to play bingo.
SUPMALE:"No, Ma, I don't need that vacation, you need new wallpaper.
LEADFEMALE:"My car will last another year" All right, Dorothy.
OTHERMALE:I see behind that mask.
LEADMALE:You're angry.
LEADFEMALE:You're damn right, I'm angry.
LEADMALE:You've been hoarding money for the last 10 years and taking advantage of me.
LEADFEMALE:Of course I'm angry.
LEADMALE:No, it's something else.
LEADFEMALE:I think you didn't get enough hugs when you were a kid.
SUPMALE:It's payback time.
OTHERFEMALE:Come here, pussycat.
LEADMALE:Why don't you hug your money, Ma? From now on, I'm not paying for anything.
LEADMALE:You are on your own.
OTHERFEMALE:You can't do this to me.
SUPFEMALE:You never touch the principal.
OTHERFEMALE:That money's for my old age.
SUPFEMALE:"Old age"? You don't leave fingerprints anymore.
LEADMALE:I'm in my twilight years.
LEADMALE:You're in the Twilight Zone.
OTHERFEMALE:Hopi Indians are walking around saying, "How does she do it?" Ma, you're cut off.
LEADFEMALE: I had to see you this morning.
SUPFEMALE:I just couldn't go to the drugstore without giving you this.
LEADMALE:Oh, why, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Why--Why are you going to the drugstore? I'm your pharmacist.
LEADMALE:You're Bill.
LEADFEMALE:Bill, the pharmacist.
LEADMALE:Bill, the man in your life.
LEADMALE:I'll pick you up after work.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, my love.
OTHERFEMALE: Girls! Blanche, what's wrong? My handsome soldier from last night is a pharmacist, a name-tag wearing, pill-counting, "Thank you, come again.
SUPFEMALE:"Sorry, we don't validate," pharmacist.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if he doesn't validate, get rid of him.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, dump him like you do all the rest.
LEADMALE:Well, ordinarily, I would, but how--how can I do that? He's-- He's been dreaming of me for over a year.
SUPFEMALE:And I care about him.
LEADMALE:I mean, I care about him when he's a soldier.
LEADMALE:Oh, I said things to him last night, I've never said to anybody.
LEADFEMALE:Clean things.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, I can't dump this man.
LEADMALE:Not after what I've meant to him.
LEADFEMALE:Not after what he's done for his country.
SUPMALE:Girls, how do you think this sounds? "Dear Bill, I always promised my father, Big Daddy, "that I would never get serious about anybody "he didn't approve of.
LEADMALE:Since he is dead, I feel" Oh, for God's sake, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess I could always tell him that he's too good for me.
SUPMALE:Sometimes the truth is best.
LEADFEMALE:Here you go.
LEADFEMALE:Half butter pecan, half rocky road.
LEADFEMALE:Just like you like it, ma'am.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Sophia.
LEADMALE: Oh, here, darling, that's for you.
SUPFEMALE:Wow, a whole dollar.
LEADMALE:Now I can buy those knee-highs I've been saving up for.
LEADFEMALE:Let me know if you have any more work, Blanche.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I may want you to take this letter down to the pharmacy and give it to Bill.
LEADMALE:Oh, Blanche, you're not gonna send that letter.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, that's so cold.
LEADMALE:Don't you think you owe him a face-to-face explanation? Good job, Dorothy.
SUPMALE:Cut off what little income I've got.
SUPMALE:Blanche, instead of sending the letter, why don't you talk to him? I mean, get to know him.
LEADFEMALE:Find out where this goes.
LEADMALE:You know, ever since we've known you, you have never once worked on having a meaningful relationship.
LEADFEMALE:I have had many meaningful relationships.
LEADMALE:Many, many, many meaningful relationships.
LEADMALE:Sharing a worm from a tequila bottle is not meaningful.
LEADFEMALE:No, you find one little flaw in somebody, and you run away.
LEADMALE:"A little flaw"? He has skinny arms.
LEADMALE:How'd you like to be made love to by somebody who has arms like your mother? My father made love to her because of her inner beauty.
OTHERMALE:He never saw me naked.
OTHERMALE:I don't know, Dorothy, maybe you're right.
LEADMALE:I should try to make this relationship work.
LEADFEMALE: Okay, I'm gonna go get prettied up and then I'm going down to the drugstore and--and get to know more about this man.
LEADMALE:You know, Bill's likes, Bill's dislikes, Bill's last name.
OTHERFEMALE:I used to put the Haley's M-O on the bottom, nothing.
SUPMALE:Then I put it eye level.
LEADFEMALE:The public went nuts.
LEADMALE:It was walking out of the store.
LEADMALE:People will bend for aspirins.
OTHERFEMALE:They won't bend for laxatives.
SUPMALE:Isn't that fascinating, Bill.
LEADMALE:So, Bill, what's on sale? Breast pumps.
SUPMALE:What else? Afro Sheen.
LEADMALE:Moving on.
SUPFEMALE:Preparation H.
OTHERFEMALE:Hot damn.
OTHERMALE: Isn't she awful? So, Bill, what other exciting things can you tell me about the drugstore business? Blanche, we gotta talk.
LEADFEMALE:You know the laxative thing? Mmm-hmm.
SUPFEMALE:That's about as exciting as it gets.
SUPFEMALE:This place, my job, it's pretty routine.
SUPMALE:Oh, what are you talking about? You're a hero.
LEADMALE:Over there.
LEADFEMALE:Over here, I'm just an ordinary guy.
LEADFEMALE: Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Here.
OTHERFEMALE:You give your son this every four hours, and if his fever doesn't go down, you take him to see el doctor Seigal at 11th and Lincoln.
LEADMALE: Hey, who says you're not a hero? Welcome home.
OTHERFEMALE:It is home, isn't it? Last night I wasn't quite here yet.
LEADMALE:This morning was real.
SUPMALE:When I handed you that rose, I realized I was standing at a stranger's door.
SUPFEMALE:Because the truth is, I'm not a soldier.
LEADMALE:I'm a pharmacist in his 50s, and you're a woman in her Watch it, Bill.
LEADMALE:You're a woman in the prime of her life, who I would like to get to know better.
LEADMALE:Slowly.
LEADMALE:And we can both see other people? Sure.
LEADMALE:Aw! Oh, sir? Mmm? I caught this old lady assaulting a man over the last tube of Preparation H.
LEADMALE:The tube broke and it's all over aisle 7.
SUPMALE:I detained her for scooping up the rest of the ointment and putting it in her purse.
LEADFEMALE:Sophia! Oh, big deal.
LEADMALE:The other guy got away scot-free, and he wriggled in it.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Ma, I bought you a little something.
LEADFEMALE:You what? I bought you a new handbag to replace the one that you ruined at the drugstore.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank God.
SUPFEMALE:The other one shrank down to the size of a change purse.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:What's the catch? Ma, there's no catch.
LEADMALE:I just realized I like taking care of you.
LEADFEMALE:I just wish you could have told me about the money, so we could be honest with each other.
SUPFEMALE:It's not that I want the money.
LEADFEMALE:If I don't leave my children anything, I'm a nobody.
SUPMALE:How many times have I heard, "He provided well," or, "She didn't leave a dime"? I want you to be able to have everything you want when I'm gone.
OTHERMALE:And when you do, you'll think, "I have this because of Ma.
SUPMALE:" Oh, Ma.
SUPMALE:Life isn't just valued by the money you leave.
LEADMALE:It's-- It's the memories.
LEADMALE:The love.
SUPMALE:And you filled my life with that.
LEADFEMALE:You're right, pussycat.
LEADMALE:And I should want to see you enjoy some of that money while I'm still around.
LEADMALE:Here's a molar.
LEADFEMALE:Buy yourself something pretty.
LEADFEMALE:That is so sweet.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, I tell you what.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me make you a cup of tea.
LEADMALE:I, Sophia Petrillo, when I die, wanna be blown to a million, billion bits.
SUPMALE: I, Sophia Petrillo, leave my daughter to science.
LEADFEMALE:
