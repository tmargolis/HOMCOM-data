George: I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls , here at the stadium ,don't offer much by way of privacy . But I was thinking if we extend the doors all the way to the floors ......

Mr. . Steinbrenner: All the way to the floor ! What are you crazy ! You'd suffocate in there . Your lucky you have any doors at all . You know when I was in the army ...... Hey Costanza . What's that your eating over there ? It looks pretty tasty .

George and Mr. Steinbrenner at Yankee Stadium

Mr. Steinbrenner: I am loving this calzone . The pita pocket prevents it from dripping . The pita pocket . What is it Watson ? A lost and found. No . I don't think we need that . If people keel over because they lost something that's there tough luck . You got a drip on your mouth by the way . George: You know a lost and found could be a good idea .

Mr. Steinbrenner: Hold on Watson . You like lost and found George ?

George: Definitely .

Mr. Steinbrenner: All right lost and found . But these got to be a time limit. We're not running a pawn shop here .

Elaine: What's she going to do ? There's no more tickets .

Jerry: We'll see .

Todd: Hey Jerry . Do you like cigars ?

Jerry: Yeah . Why ?

Jerry and George at the coffee shop

George: There putting in a lost and found because of me . There's a time limit but still .

Jerry: There really building a Utopian society up there huh .And you tribute all this to the calzone .

George: Yeah . I am like a drug dealer . I got the guy hooked . I am having lunch at his desk everyday this week . He doesn't make a move without me .It's very exciting .

Jerry: With you two guys at the helm . The last piece of the puzzle is in place.

George: So let me ask you a question about the tip jar . I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week . I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way . And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing . I mean if they don't notice it what's the point .

Jerry: So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind .

George: Not bills .

Jerry: So George . Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants . We are at the movies last night . It's sold out . Nikki goes and talks to the manager . Right in .

George: Beautiful women . You know they could get away with murder . You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds . They get whatever they want whenever they want it . You can't stop them .

Jerry: She's like a beautiful Godzilla .

George: Without thousands of fleeing Japanese .

Jerry and Kramer at his apartment

Kramer: Hey buddy .

Jerry: What the hell is all this ?

Kramer: I am looking for quarters for the dryer .

Jerry: Why can't you do this on your table ?

Kramer: Because I don't have a table .

Elaine walks in

Elaine: Hey .

Jerry: Hey . So how was "Blame it on the Rain ?"

Elaine: Huh . Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too .

Jerry: Oh !! Let me ask you a question . Was the movie part of the bet ?

Kramer leaves

Elaine: No . We were both in the mood for one .

Jerry: You know Elaine , It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends ....

Elaine: Oh is that so .

Jerry: Absolutely . But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet .

Elaine: What are you talking about ?

Jerry: Come on . Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars . He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner

Elaine: If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.

Jerry: Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected . He has found a dating loop hole .

Elaine: I don't buy it.

Kramer walks in with more change

Jerry: So what happened after the movie ?

Elaine: Nothing . He walked me home .

Jerry: To the door ?

Elaine: Yeah .

Jerry: That's a date .

Mr. Steinbrenner: Beautiful . I am starving George .

George: I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef .

Mr. Steinbrenner: Corn beef . I don't think so . It is a little fatty .

George: How about Chinese ?

Mr. Steinbrenner: Uhhhhh . No . Too many containers . Big mess , big mess . Too sloppy .I want to stick with the calzones from Pisano's . That's the ticket .

George: I just thought it would be nice . A little variety .

Mr. Steinbrenner: No , no , no . George let me tell you something . When I find something I like I stick with it . From 1973 to 1982 I ate the exact same lunch everyday . Turkey chili in a bowl made out of bread . Bread bowl George. First you eat the chili then you eat the bowl . There's nothing more satisfying than looking down after lunch and seeing nothing but a table .

Elaine: Thanks for the dinner .

Todd: Well I had to give these cigars and we were both hungry .

Elaine: Hey Todd . Let me ask you a question . Um . Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out ?

Todd: What ?

Elaine: I mean Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars ?

Todd: Elaine that was a legitimate bet and I lost so I bought you dinner .

Elaine: Oh all right . Okay well , goodnight .

Todd: Hey , if your not doing anything Saturday do you want to meet somewhere?

Elaine: See what is that ? Is that a date ?

Todd: Why can't two people go and do something without it being a date ?

Elaine: All right . I am sorry it's not a date .

Todd: No way . So I'll see you Saturday night ?

Elaine: All right .

Todd: Pick you up at 8:00 p.m.

Nikki: Not at all .

Police officer: I got you on the radar at 93 miles per hour .

Jerry: You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100 .

Nikki: Officer . Hi . Do you really have to give us a ticket ?

Jerry: All right Nik . That's it .

Kramer and Jerry at his apartment

Jerry: Peru ! I paid $300 bucks for these . I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks !

Kramer: You got ripped buddy .

Jerry: I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuseto see Elaine again without asking her out .

Kramer: That's a nice name . Todd Gack . Is that Dutch ? Oh baby . Here we go . Uh momma .(putting his fresh out of the oven shirt on ) Hey George hey .

George: Well this is bad . I am really in a bad situation now .

Jerry: so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones ?

George: What's he going to do ? That's exactly the point . Nobody knows what this guy is capable of ! He fires people like it is a bodily function .

Jerry: Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you ?

George: Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him . You know how these interoffice politics work .

Jerry: No . I never had a job .

Kramer walks in with no pants on

Kramer: I decided to go with the brown one 's . 

George: What the hell is this ?

Jerry: Kramer's cooking up some corduroy .

George: There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's .

Kramer: Pisano's . That's the place by the stadium right ?

George: Yeah . You've heard of it ?

Kramer: Yeah . Newman raves about it . It's on his mail route . He goes by there everyday .

George: I'll see you guys later .

Jerry: What kind of pie are you cooking ?

Kramer: Huckleberry .

George at Newman's apartment

Newman: You certainly are in a bind .

George: Yeah . And since you go buy there everyday . I was hoping that we could help each other out .

Newman: Oh well . Let me perfectly blunt . I don't care for you Costanza . You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just it up wasting your lives .

George: Are you going to help me or not ?

Newman: All right , all right . I'll help you but I will except something in return .

George: What ?

Newman: Well for starters I want a calzone of my own .....

George: All right .

Newman: And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie .

George: That's a little steep don't you think ?

Newman: You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic . I would hate to see him when he's hungry .

George: All right , all right .

Newman: Do we have a deal ?

George: But I have to have them by one o'clock . He's very regiment about his meals .

Newman: I know exactly how he feels . Pleasure doing business with you . Do come again . Ha , ha , ha , ha .

Elaine: Come on Todd . Admit it , this is a date .

Todd: Why is this a date ?

Elaine: Saturday night with your parents . Unless I'm your sister this is a date.

George: You don't work in the rain ? Your a mailman . " Neither rain nor sleet nor snow ....." It's the first one .

Newman: I was never that big on creeds .

George: You were supposed to deliver my calzones . We had a deal !

Newman: I believe the deal was that I get the calzones on my mail route . Well today I won't be going on my mail route ! Will I . Perhaps tomorrow .

George: But I'm paying you !

Newman: Yes thank you . 

George: Newman !!

Nikki: Peru ? I thought you wanted cigars from Cuba ?

Jerry: I did .

Nikki: Well if these aren't what you wanted then why did you pay him ?

George's office at Yankee Stadium

George: What happened ? Where have you been ?

Kramer: The guy wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change .

George: What the hell happened to your shirt ?

Kramer: He overcooked it . It's ruined .

George: Your clothes smell just like Pisano's . There's another Italian place on Jerome . Maybe I can fool him .

Mr. Steinbrenner on phone: That's right . Do you want to say it again . I'll say it again . I hadn't had a pimple since I was eighteen and I don't care that you don't believe me or not . And how's this . Your fired . Okay your not.I am just a little hungry . Where's Costanza with my calzone . It's 1:15. He's late . That smell . I have to call you back . Costanza . He's in the building . Costanza is in the building and he's not in this office . Costanza! I'll get you .

Jerry: Stupid cigars . You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldn't be together .

Elaine: These are terrible .

Jerry: It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone .

Elaine: What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway .

Jerry: I think it's Dutch . I got to get going .

Elaine: Where are you going ?

Jerry: I ... uh ....promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her .

Elaine: But she broke up with you .

Jerry: I know , I know . But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no .

Elaine: It smells like a rubber fire .

Jerry:What's that ?

Elaine: I said rubber fire .

Jerry: Oh .

Elaine: Did you ever pay Todd for these things ?

Jerry: Actually it's being taken care of right now .

Kramer: You Gack ?

Todd: Yeah .

Kramer: Here's your money .

Mr. Steinbrenner: George . Why do these clothes smell like Pisano's ?

George: Because they were heated up there .

Mr. Steinbrenner: Heating up your clothes ? That's not a bad idea .
