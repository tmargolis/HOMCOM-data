George: "Keep it real!"
George: "Let's get nuts!" 
George: "When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner?" 
George: "What's that?"
Jerry: "It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday."
George: "How much was it?"
Jerry: "Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal."
George: "Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?"
Jerry: "Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite."
George: "I got a message from the Rosses at work today."
Jerry: "Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?"
George: "At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death."
Jerry: "Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly." 
Elaine: "Oh, um... Darryl. These are... people I know. Jerry, George."
Darryl: "Nice meeting you. Ah, I gotta run, Elaine. I'll see you later."
Elaine: "OK."
Jerry: "Still no Puddy?"
Elaine: "Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?"
Jerry: "What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?"
Elaine: "What black guy?"
Jerry: "Darryl. He's black, isn't he?"
Elaine: "He is?"
George: "No, he isn't."
Jerry: "Isn't he, Elaine?"
Elaine: "You think?"
George: "I thought he looked Irish."
Jerry: "What's his last name?"
Elaine: "Nelson."
George: "That's not Irish."
Jerry: "I think he's black."
George: "Should we be talkin' about this?"
Elaine: "I think it's OK."
George: "No, it isn't."
Jerry: "Why not?"
George: "Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here."
Jerry: "If he's black."
Elaine: "Is he black?"
Jerry: "Does it matter?"
Elaine: "No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know."
Jerry: "Oh, so you need to know?"
Elaine: "No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew."
Waitress: "Should I take that?" 
Jerry: "Uh, one second." 
Elaine: "Oh, here." 
George: "Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... yeah."   
George: "Uh, Mrs. Ross? It's-it's George." 
Mrs. Ross: "Uh, who?"
George: "George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak." 
Mr. Ross: "We're all out of lime juice. I told that woman to buy more." 
Mrs. Ross: "Uh, George, the Susan Ross Foundation is having an event this weekend."
George: "Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers." Mr. Ross, again walking by: "I'm goin' back to bed." 
Mrs. Ross: "Thank you for calling, George."
George: "Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta go."
Jerry: "House in the Hamptons?"
George: "Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons."  
Kramer: "Well."
Jerry: "Hey."
Kramer: "Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate."
Jerry: "Wow. What are we celebrating?"
Kramer: "Uh, you remember my coffee table book?"
Jerry: "With the little legs?"
Kramer: "That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie."
George: "How are they gonna make that book into a movie?"
Kramer: "You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?"
George: "Yeah?"
Kramer: "Independence Day?"
George: "Oh."
Jerry: "How much are they payin' you?"
Kramer: "Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. A long while."
Jerry: "That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while."
Kramer: "Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring."
Jerry: "From what?"
Kramer: "From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do." 
Jerry: "What's that?"
Kramer: "Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch." Jerry and George: "Ooh!"
Kramer: "Well, it's not really gold." Jerry and George: "Aww."   
Elaine: "Hey."
Darryl: "Hey."
Elaine: "Great music."
Darryl: "Oh, it's my neighbor. They blast that stuff twenty four hours a day. I hate it."
Darryl: "Yo, you! Turn it down!"
Elaine: "Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?"
Darryl: "They're... African."
Elaine: "Right. African."
Darryl: "Well, not Africa, actually. South Africa."
Elaine: "South Africa."
Darryl: "My family used to live there, but, uh, we got out years ago, for obvious reasons. You know how it is."
Elaine: "Maybe."  
George: "You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this." 
George: "I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time."
Vender: "Are you gonna buy a hot dog or not?"
George: "Mmm... no."  Morty, in Florida, as Jerry comes out of his room, having just woken up: "Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha!"
Jerry: "It's 5:30 in the morning!"
Helen: "We let you sleep in." 
Jerry: "Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday."
Morty: "Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents."
Jerry: "What does that mean?"
Helen: "Leave your father alone. It's his birthday."
Morty: "Oooh! Heh heh! It's a radar detector."
Jerry: "Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer."
Morty: "This looks like too much money."
Jerry: "Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks."
Morty: "You think it's hot?"
Jerry: "Could be."
Morty: "Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!"
Helen: "I'm right here."
Jerry: "And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator."
Morty: "So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?"
Jerry: "Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner."
Morty: "Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips."
Helen: "Jerry, you're getting your father too excited."  
Kramer: "Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?"
Jerry: "Kramer, what are you doing here?"
Kramer: "I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door."
Helen: "Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment."
Kramer: "Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it."
Jerry: "Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die." 
Jerry: "Not you. Older people."
Helen: "Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. How 'bout a feta cheese omelette?"
Kramer: "Mmmm, that sounds great, Mom."
Jerry: "If you feed him, he'll never leave."
Helen: "We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters?" 
Kramer: "I guess."
Jerry: "I can't believe this."
Kramer: "I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?"  
Elaine: "So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?"
George: "Actually, I did have a thought."
Elaine: "Oh."
George: "Why don't you just ask him?" 
Elaine: "Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know."
George: "Maybe he's, um... mixed."
Elaine: "Is that the right word?"
George: "I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this."
Elaine: "Yeah." 
George: "I'm just gonna go to the bathroom." 
Elaine: "You know what, I'm leavin'."
George: "Yeah."
Elaine: "I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back." 
Elaine: "Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross." 
Mrs. Ross: "Oh, you're George's friend." 
Mr. Ross: "We saw him in the city this weekend. Uh, what happened to his place in the Hamptons?" 
Elaine: "The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one."
George: "Rosses." Mr. Ross: "George, we were just talking about you."
George: "Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about." 
Mrs. Ross: "Really?"
George: "Yeah, I may move out there." 
George: "I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!"  Morty, eating lunch with Helen and Jerry: "Another fine meal, and now for my Wizard tip calculator."
Jerry: "Dad, it's got lots of other functions."
Morty: "Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions." Morty, trying to open it: "I can't get it open." 
Helen: "Yay! Jerry got it open."
Morty: "The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water. How does 12.4% sound?" 
Jerry: "Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents."
Morty: "We'll round down."
Helen: "Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections."
Jerry: "Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo."
Morty: "I was never impeached! I resigned!"
Helen: "Even so, the press would bury him!"
Jerry: "What press?"
Helen: "The condo newsletter, the Boca Breeze."
Morty: "Pinko Commie rag."  Old Man, coming up to the three Seinfelds: "Hey, Morty. Your boy here, he just got a date with that young aquacise instructor."
Jerry: "She's fifty." Old Man: "You know what he's got? He's got charisma. That's my man."
Kramer: "All right, I'll see you guys." Old Man: "Yeah."
Kramer: "Yeah."  
Kramer,: "Morty, what're you lookin' at?"
Morty: "I'll tell you what I'm looking at: the next condo president of Del Boca Vista, Phase Three."
Kramer: "Hmm."  Darryl, with Elaine in his apartment: "Elaine, thank you for the Wizard!" 
Darryl: "Wow, it's got so many functions."
Elaine: "Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball..."
Darryl: "Well, I don't do that stuff."
Elaine: "It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one: race."
Darryl: "Isn't that optional?"
Elaine: "It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know."
Darryl: "All right, I'm... Asian."
Elaine: "What?"
Darryl: "Just to mess with 'em."
Elaine: laughing awkwardly: "Oh. Right. Good one."
Darryl: "Average income, uh... over a hundred thousand."
Elaine: "Really?"
Darryl: "Does that matter?"
Elaine: "No, but... it is very nice to know."  
Jerry: "So did you figure out Darryl's... you know." 
Elaine: "Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way." 
Jerry: "You're a master of race relations."
Elaine: "Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?"
Jerry: "Yeah, it's all my father's doing." 
Jerry: "He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse."
Elaine: "Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?"
Jerry: "Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair." 
George: "Jerry?" 
Elaine: "He's still down with his folks." 
George: "What are you doin' here?" 
Jerry: "Elaine, Elaine--" 
Elaine: "I'm gettin' his mail." 
Jerry: "Oh, no." 
George: "He asked you to get the mail?" 
Elaine: "Mm-hmm." 
George: "Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?"
Jerry: "George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak." Elaine, trying to understand what they're talking about: "What?"
George: "What about the mail?"
Jerry: "This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George." 
George: "All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya."  
George: "So, I ran into the Rosses again."
Elaine: "Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?"
George: "From me."
Elaine: "What did you say?"
George: "I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?"
Elaine: "I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed."
George: "So, they knew? Those liars!"
Elaine: "But you lied first."
George: "Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!"
Elaine: "Like you're a liar!"
George: "Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard?"
Elaine: "So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over."
George: "Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first."
Elaine: "Haven't you done enough to these people?"
George: "This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets."   
Kramer: "Vote for Kramer." 
Kramer: "Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for condo president. I'd like your vote. Thanks." 
Kramer: "Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is a vote for Kramer." Old Woman: "Will you cut my meat?"
Kramer: "Gladly."  Waitress, to Darryl, who's with Elaine at Monk's: "Coffee?"
Darryl: "Sure." Waitress, to Darryl: "Are you black? Or should I bring some cream."
Darryl: "I'm black." Darryl, re-thinking: "Oh, you know what? Bring a little cream." Darryl, seeing a couple gesturing towards him and Elaine: "Did you hear that?"
Elaine: "What?"
Darryl: "God, there are still people who have trouble with an interracial couple."
Elaine: "Interracial? Us?"
Darryl: "Isn't that unbelievable!?"
Elaine: "Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!"
Darryl: "I don't feel like eating."
Elaine: "Me neither. Well, maybe this turkey club." 
George: "So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons." 
Mrs. Ross: "Sounds grand."
George: "Do you have your bathing suits?" 
Mr. Ross: "It's March."
George: "Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive. Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!"  
Jerry: "Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin." 
Jerry: "Dad, you look so different."
Kramer: "Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must walk among them." Morty, coming into the hall: "This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's the election!"
Kramer: "Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m."
Jerry: "You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner."
Morty: "Daily what?" Helen, coming into the condo: "Have you read today's Boca Breeze?"
Kramer: "Hey, look at that. Picture of me, huh?" 
Kramer: "Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in clubhouse."
Morty: "Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the rules."
Kramer: "Well, I couldn't find my shoes."
Jerry: "Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules."
Helen: "Who wants hot chocolate?"
Kramer: "Oh, yeah! Me."
Morty: "This is a huge scandal! We need damage control."
Kramer: "All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh?"
Jerry: "Wizards!"
Kramer: "Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board."
Jerry: "Kramer..."
Morty: "There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that deal."
Kramer: "Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next, Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?" Morty, rushing to his bedroom: "First, I need a nap." Helen, running after him: "Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!"
Jerry: "Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards."
Kramer: "Well, what about your deal, huh?"
Jerry: "I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?"
Kramer: "Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy."
Jerry: "Down here?"
Kramer: "Yeah, Bob Saccamano's father."  
George: "And that leads into the master bedroom." 
Mrs. Ross: "Tell us more."
George: "You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium." 
Mr. Ross: "Another solarium?"
George: "Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?" 
Mr. Ross: "What are their names?"
George: "Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?" 
Mrs. Ross: "Oh, look, an antique stand. Pull over. We'll buy you a housewarming gift." 
George: "Housewarming gift." 
George: "All right, we're taking it up a notch!"  Waitress at Monk's, handing Elaine a menu: "Here you go." 
Elaine: "Long day?"
Waitress: "Yeah, I just worked a triple shift."
Elaine: "I hear ya, Sister."
Waitress: "Sister?" 
Elaine: "Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's black. Here he is. See?"
Darryl: "Hi, Elaine."
Elaine: "Hey."
Waitress: "He's black?"
Elaine: "Yeah."
Darryl: "I'm black?"
Elaine: "Aren't you?" Waitress, leaving: "I'll give you a couple minutes to decide."
Darryl: "What are you talking about?"
Elaine: "You're black. You said we were an interracial couple."
Darryl: "We are. Because you're Hispanic."
Elaine: "I am?"
Darryl: "Aren't you?"
Elaine: "No. Why would you think that?"
Darryl: "Your name's Benes, your hair, and you kept taking me to those Spanish restaurants."
Elaine: "That's because I thought you were black."
Darryl: "Why would you take me to a Spanish restaurant because I'm black?"
Elaine: "I don't think we should be talking about this."
Darryl: "So, what are you?"
Elaine: "I'm white."
Darryl: "So, we're just a couple of white people?"
Elaine: "I guess."
Darryl: "Oh."
Elaine: "Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?" Darryl, leaving with Elaine: "Sure."  
Kramer: "Oh, well... I handed out all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think we've got this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman, he won't be leavin' any tips where he is."
Jerry: "Aw."
Morty: "Congratulations, Mr. President."
Kramer: "Congratulations, Mr. Puppet Master." 
Old Man: "Hey, Morty, what's wrong with these tip calculators?"
Morty: "What are you talking about?" 
Old Man: "It's overtipping. I just left five bucks for a BLT."
Morty: "This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard."
Jerry: "A Willard? Saccamano, Sr. screwed me!" 
Old Man #2: "Mine doesn't have a seven!" 
Old Man #3: "I'm ruined!"
Morty: "Jerry, why didn't you get them Wizards?"
Jerry: "Because a real Wizard's two hundred dollars."
Morty: "You didn't have a deal?"
Jerry: "No deal. Not hot." Old Man: "Morty, you, and Kramer, you're finished."
Kramer: "What?" Old Man: "Everyone vote for the guy in the wheelchair." 
Kramer: "Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York."
Jerry: "Dad, I'm sorry."
Morty: "You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars on a tip calculator?!"
Jerry: "It does other things!"  
Mr. Ross: "Where are we, George?"
George: "Almost there." 
Mr. Ross: "Well, this is the end of Long Island. Where's your house?"
George: "We, uh, we go on foot from here." 
Mr. Ross: "All right."
George: "There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. There's no Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium." 
Mr. Ross: "We know."
George: "Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why?" 
Mrs. Ross: "We don't like you, George." 
Mr. Ross: "And we always blamed you for what happened to Susan."
George: "Oh." Mr. Ross: "All right! Let's head back."
