JERRY: Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB. 
ELAINE: Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach. 
JERRY: Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?   
ELAINE: What is this, a 'bit'? 
JERRY: No. 
ELAINE: 'Cos I'm not in the mood. 
JERRY: We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one! 
ELAINE: Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit. 
JERRY: They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well. 
ELAINE:  Alright, are you done with your little amusement? 
JERRY:  Then you admit it was amusing? 
ELAINE: It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder. 
JERRY:  Great. Thanks.     
ELAINE: So, your firm designed all the furniture in here? 
BRETT: We manufacture it. The original designs are by Karl Farbman.  
ELAINE:  Oh, Farbman. 
BRETT: You know Farbman? 
ELAINE: Mm, love Farbman.    
BRETT: Most people go their whole lives without sitting in a Farbman. 
ELAINE: Wuh, if you call that living.  Ahaha.  
ELAINE: Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?  
ELAINE: Brett? Don't you think that would be great?   
ELAINE: Brett? 
BRETT:  After the song, babe. 
ELAINE: Huh? 
BRETT: The song.  Elaine stares at Brett and puts a hand to her chest, moved by his sensitivity.     
JERRY: So when do I meet this jerk? 
ELAINE: He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman. 
JERRY: Who? 
ELAINE:  I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song. 
JERRY: What song? 
ELAINE: Desperado. 
JERRY: Desperado? 
ELAINE: Uh huh. 
JERRY: And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.  
JERRY:  See that salesman, twirling that umbrella. 
ELAINE: Uh huh. 
JERRY: I invented that. 
ELAINE: That, had to be invented? 
JERRY: When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers.   
ELAINE:  Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?  Elaine marches toward the umbrella guy. 
JERRY: Elaine. 
ELAINE: Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you're doing. 
JERRY: Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson. 
CLICKY: Teddy Padillac came up with this twirl. 
ELAINE:  Ohh. 
JERRY: I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth. 
CLICKY: Yeah, that's where he come up with it. 
JERRY: In his dreams. 
ELAINE: Alright, can we  go?  Elaine walks off, crossing the street. Jerry follows. 
JERRY:  By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers.     
JERRY: It's the twirling that dazzles the eye. 
GEORGE:  I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans. 
JERRY:  Those belong to people.   
KRAMER: Hey. Well.  This was downstairs for you. Ker-ching. 
JERRY:  Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign 'em. 
GEORGE: What checks? 
KRAMER: Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan. 
JERRY: I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show. 
KRAMER: Yeah, the Super Terrific Happy Hour. 
JERRY:  They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks. 
GEORGE: Look at all of those! You're rich! 
JERRY: Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign 'em.  
KRAMER: Hey, Jerry, you need any new furniture? 
JERRY: Why? 
KRAMER:  Yeah, well, Elaine's new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's a Farbman.   
GEORGE: He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy? 
JERRY: Ah, who are any of her losers? 
GEORGE:  You're on that list.  George goes and gets his coat. 
GEORGE: Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars. 
KRAMER: Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners? 
EGO: Yeah, you heard of 'em? 
KRAMER: They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment. 
GEORGE: So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather. 
JERRY: I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.     
JERRY: Signed over a hundred checks this morning. 
KRAMER: Hello, twelve dollars.  
KRAMER:  Oh, yeah, sure.  
JERRY: I'm gonna ask this guy something.  
JERRY:  Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you?  
KRAMER:  Hey, are you folks from Japan.  
MR YAMAGUCHI: Hai.  MR OH: Yes. 
KRAMER:  You recognise that mug?  
KRAMER: That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour. 
MR OH: Ahh, Super Terrific Happy...  The three guys all speak to each other in excited Japanese. 
KRAMER: Ah, yeah. Yeah, that's him.  Kramer and the three guys look along to where Jerry is still talking vigorously to the umbrella guy.  
MR OH: What is he doing? 
KRAMER: Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.  
MR OH: He's funny. 
KRAMER: Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his antics.  
KRAMER: Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in America.  
CREW LEADER:  We're pretty much finished.  
CREW LEADER: There's just one more thing. 
GEORGE:  Here it comes.  
CREW LEADER:  You forgot to sign your check.  
GEORGE:  Sorry.  You're sure, uh, there isn't anything else?  
CREW LEADER:  No.  The carpet cleaners begin to leave. 
GEORGE:  So, that's it?  
CREW LEADER: Unless you need a receipt. 
GEORGE:  I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere.  
CREW LEADER:  Good luck with that.  
JERRY: Hey. 
ELAINE: What's with the claw? 
JERRY: Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.   
BRETT:  There's no sign of Kramer. 
ELAINE: Oh, Brett.  This is Jerry. 
JERRY: Hi.  Jerry holds up his twisted hand in greeting. 
BRETT: That's very funny. 
JERRY: Ah, I'm one kind.  
ELAINE: Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer? 
JERRY: The Fleckman. 
BRETT: Farbman. 
JERRY: Right. 
ELAINE: You gotta see 'em. Beautiful. 
JERRY:  Oh, I'm sure they are. 
BRETT: I'd be happy to get you some if that's what you're driving at. 
JERRY: No. I'm fine, thank you. 
BRETT: Don't worry. It's no charge to you.   
BRETT: Looks like what you really need is a decent desk for writing your skits. 
JERRY:  I don't write skits. 
BRETT:  Well, of course you don't. You don't have a proper workstation. I'll fax you over my catalogue. 
ELAINE: Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine. 
BRETT:  Oops.  
BRETT: Well, I'm sure things'll pick up for you soon. Elaine, maybe we should get going.  
ELAINE: Oh. Jerry, you wanna join us? 
JERRY: Oh, where you going? The coffee shop? 
BRETT:  Coffee shop? I think we can do a little better than that. You look like you could use a solid meal at a real restaurant. 
JERRY: You look like you could use a... 
ELAINE:  Jerry.     
KRAMER:  Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo?  
KRAMER:  Thirty thousand?! These are practically free.  
KRAMER: Giddyup. You're a cowboy now.  
BRETT: I feel terrible about your friend Jerry. He's upset that I gave Kramer that chest of drawers, isn't he? 
ELAINE: Why? Why d'you think he's upset? 
BRETT: How could he not be? Living in that cramped little apartment. And outdated furniture, so terribly... un-Karl Farbman-like. 
ELAINE:  We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we? 
BRETT:  I hope not.  
ELAINE:  Brett? Everything alright?  
ELAINE:  Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside? 
BRETT: Elaine, the song. 
ELAINE:  Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on the fender... 
BRETT: Elaine, could you just not talk for one minute? 
ELAINE:  Sorry.  
JERRY: No spiel? 
GEORGE:  Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult! 
JERRY: So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you? 
GEORGE: They could've at least tried! 
JERRY: You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed? 
GEORGE: Please. 
JERRY: Too dumb?  George gives Jerry a look. 
JERRY:  Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds. 
KRAMER: Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends.  They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room. 
JERRY: Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around. 
KRAMER: Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm?  Jerry looks puzzled. 
KRAMER: That's right. 
GEORGE: How'd you hook up with these guys? 
KRAMER: Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you. 
JERRY: What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan? 
KRAMER:  Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did. 
GEORGE:  Yeah, the pilot! 
KRAMER: That's right, I think that had marvellous production values. 
GEORGE:  And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York! 
JERRY: Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed. 
GEORGE:  It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their dates!  
KRAMER: George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.  
TV JERRY: You had a date? You went out with my butler?! Who said you could go out with my butler?!  
TV ELAINE: Well, why do I need your permission?  
TV JERRY: Because he's my butler.  The first executive stops the tape. 
GEORGE:  So? What d'you think?  
EXECUTIVE 1: We're bit confused. Why was this man Jerry's butler? 
GEORGE: Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler.  
EXECUTIVE 1: Is this customary in your legal system? 
JERRY: No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.  
EXECUTIVE 1:  SUBTITLE: Are you following any of this?  
EXECUTIVE 2:  SUBTITLE: I'm still trying to figure out why they gave us a bag of oranges.  
EXECUTIVE 1:  I'm sorry. I'm sure Mr Seinfeld is very funny to Americans, but I'm not sure this butler show would work in Japan. 
GEORGE: Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too long.  You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges.  
EXECUTIVE 1:  SUBTITLE: Again with the oranges  
JERRY:  Sorry. My hand is numb. 
GEORGE:  Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour.   
EXECUTIVE 1: You must go now.  Jerry pats George on the knee. George squeezes Jerry's shoulder and they ruefully begin to depart. 
ELAINE: Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado. 
JERRY:  What does he listen to? The all Desperado station? 
ELAINE: He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences. 
JERRY: You know, what you need is a song you can share. 
ELAINE: Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song. 
JERRY: Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about? 
ELAINE:  I like Witchy Woman. 
JERRY: Witchy Woman? 
ELAINE: You know, Witchy Woman.  'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'. 
JERRY:  Ahh. Wit-chay Woman.  T 
KRAMER:  Hey, man. 
ELAINE: Hey.  
JERRY: Hey. How was the Rainbow Room? 
KRAMER: Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill. 
JERRY: Ah. 
KRAMER: Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows? 
JERRY: What for?  Kramer wanders into Jerry's bedroom. 
KRAMER : Yeah, well, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with me. 
JERRY: I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?  Kramer reenters, carrying three pillows. 
KRAMER: Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do. 
JERRY: Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear? 
KRAMER: Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen.  
ELAINE: Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars? 
KRAMER: Evidently.  Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them. 
ELAINE: In them?! 
JERRY: You have them sleeping in drawers?! 
KRAMER: Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home. 
JERRY: This has 'international incident' written all over it. 
KRAMER:  Oh yeah, yeah.     Up against one wall of the apartment stands a very large chest of three drawers. It's about six feet long and each drawers is maybe a foot and a half deep. 
KRAMER: Goodnight, Mr Tanaka.  One of the Japanese tourists sits up in the drawer.  
MR TANAKA: Goodnight.  
KRAMER: Goodnight, Mr Oh.  
MR OH:  Goodnight.  Mr Oh lies back down and Kramer slides the drawers shut, and speaks to the final drawer's occupant. 
KRAMER: Goodnight, Mr Yamaguchi.  
MR YAMAGUCHI:  Oh, yes. Goodnight.  
JERRY: What is this? 
KRAMER: Rice Crispies. East meets West, Jerry. 
JERRY: Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well, I'm off to the bank. 
KRAMER:  Sayonara. 
JERRY:  Konichi-wa.  
BRETT: Elaine, I... 
ELAINE: Shh-shh!  What d'you think?   
ELAINE: What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song. 
BRETT: Witchy Woman is okay for you, but I've already got a song. 
ELAINE: Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado?  We can share it. 
BRETT:  No. It's mine.  
KRAMER: Here you go. Snap, crackle and pop.  
KRAMER:  Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.  
MR OH : Ach, come back in half hour.  
JERRY:  Hey, I'll take one. 
CLICKY: Well, look who's back!  
CLICKY: Teddy!  This's the guy says he invented the twirl. 
TEDDY:  Jerry Seinfeld! 
JERRY: Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see.  What've you got in a push-button mini. 
TEDDY:  Same thing we had, when you bailed on us, fifteen years ago. 
JERRY: Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee? 
TEDDY:  Oh, yeah, sure. But where were you during the poncho craze of eighty-four? I almost lost my house.  
CLICKY: Umbrella, buddy?  
CLICKY: Now we got that damn 'urban sombrero' to contend with. 
TEDDY:  Easy, there.  I hear you're taking credit for the twirl. 
JERRY: Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares? 
TEDDY:  I care. Clicky cares. 
JERRY: So, could I...  Another peal of thunder rolls as interruption. 
JERRY: Could I just buy an umbrella? 
TEDDY:  Yeah, sure. Two hundred dollars. 
JERRY:  What?! 
TEDDY:  Special price, for a real foul-weather friend.  
KRAMER: Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run the bases. 
GEORGE:  Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp on the field. 
KRAMER:  Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.  
GEORGE: Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show. 
KRAMER:  That's perfect.  Hey, how would you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?  
MR OH: But, we are also very hungry. 
KRAMER: Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, you guys just watch the tape and, uh, I'll get you some food.  
KRAMER:  Hey, peanuts!  
WILHELM: George.  George.   
WILHELM:  Uh, George, uh, did you call some carpet cleaners? 
GEORGE: Are they here? 
WILHELM: They're in my office, right now. 
GEORGE:  They haven't said anything to you, have they? 
WILHELM: About what? 
GEORGE:  What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult is this?!     
BRETT:  Hey Jerry!  J 
JERRY: Oh, hi Brett. 
BRETT: Haven't you ever heard of an umbrella? 
JERRY: Ah, I didn't have enough money. 
BRETT: I'm sure things'll pick up for you. 
JERRY: No, it's not that, it's the...  
JERRY: Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!   
BRETT: Ah, don't worry, I can spot you the  twelve cents? 
JERRY: No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing. 
BRETT: Nothing's working for you, is is? 
JERRY:  Not at the moment, Brett. 
BRETT: I'd give you a ride, but I got Karl Farbman here.  
JERRY:  Thanks for stopping!  Jerry walks away     
ELAINE: Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman. 
JERRY: Boogeyman. 
ELAINE: Boogey? 
JERRY: I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song? 
ELAINE: No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va? 
JERRY:  Eehh. 
ELAINE:  Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer!  
JERRY: Hey. 
GEORGE:  Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese friends. They loved it! 
JERRY: Really? They bought the butler character? 
GEORGE:  Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC. 
JERRY: NBC? 
GEORGE:  Nakahama Broadcast Corporation.  
JERRY: Ah. But they told us we must go now. 
GEORGE: But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers, that love the show! I'm gonna talk to Kramer.  
JERRY: Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever it is.  Just take it!  
GEORGE: Hey, by the way, what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura? 
JERRY: Who? 
GEORGE: The network executive. You think she liked me?  Jerry swings the door closed in George's face.     
KRAMER: Heyy! Look who's here.  
KRAMER:  Come on, I want you to come in here.  
MR OH: Come on in, fat boy!  George waves away their appeals with a smile. 
GEORGE: Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas.  Big day tomorrow!  
JERRY:  Last one.  
JERRY:  Uugh! Ahh.      
KRAMER: There you are.  
GEORGE: Uh.  Where's the boys? 
KRAMER: Uh, no, I let 'em sleep in.  
KRAMER: I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need a little food money. 
GEORGE:  But that meeting starts in ten minutes! 
KRAMER: No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that hot-tub.  
GEORGE:  I'm calling Jerry.     
JERRY: Yeah? 
GEORGE:  Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the hot-tub! You gotta get 'em outta the drawers and get 'em down here, or I don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV! 
JERRY:  Uncle Leo? 
GEORGE:  Jerry!!   
JERRY: Alright, alright. I'll wake 'em up.  
JERRY:  Hmm, testy.     
JERRY: Hello?  MR OH : Mr Jerry! Open the drawer, please!  
JERRY: It's stuck.  Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the wood.  
MR OH : Pull harder. 
JERRY: I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.  
MR OH : Very funny, but no joking, please. 
JERRY:  Don't worry, I'll get you out.      
ELAINE: Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this. 
BRETT: Elaine, I know he'll appreciate this. Granted, it's not as nice as Kramer's cabinet, but it's start. 
ELAINE: Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet.  
JERRY :  Move to the back of the drawers!   
ELAINE: Jerry?     
ELAINE: Jerry.  
BRETT:  Not the Farbman!!
MR OH:  SUBTITLE: Jerry Seinfeld is a dangerous lunatic. He wouldn't let us out of the drawers. Then he came at me with an axe. 
EXECUTIVE 1:  SUBTITLE: We suspect his friend here is also unbalanced.  
MR OH:  SUBTITLE: Could we have a couple of those oranges?  
MR OH:  SUBTITLE: We are very hungry and have survived many hardships.  
GEORGE:  Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?  
EXECUTIVE 1: Yes. Cleaned up the  coffee stain, left by Jerry Seinfield.  Wilhelm enters, dressed in the same yellow overall as the other carpet cleaners. 
GEORGE: Mr Wilhelm? Wha..what're you doing here? 
WILHELM: I'm here to clean the carpets. Most of the world is carpeted. And, one day, we will do the cleaning.  
GEORGE:  Him you brainwashed!  What's he got that I don't have?!  The leader shrugs, as if to say 'You work it out.' 
GEORGE:  Mr Wilhelm, listen. You've been abducted! Please, Mr Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me! 
WILHELM: Wilhelm?  My name is Tanya.  
EXECUTIVE 1:  SUBTITLE: With these two idiots I don't know how the Yankees won the World Series.  
JERRY:  Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe.  
JERRY:  At least it was just the handle! 
BRETT: It was a beautiful cabinet. What am I gonna tell...  
JERRY: Fleckman? 
ELAINE: Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down.  'Desperado, mmm-mm-mmm. You better...'  
ELAINE/JERRY:  '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'  
NURSE: His pulse is fine. 
DOCTOR: Hmm. Looks like a minor concussion. Let me see what I can do to relieve the swelling.  
NURSE: Doctor?  The doctor stares away. 
NURSE:  Doctor?  The doctor is oblivious to the nurse. 
NURSE:  Doctor?  There is still no response from the doctor. 
NURSE:  Doctor, I think we're losing him!
