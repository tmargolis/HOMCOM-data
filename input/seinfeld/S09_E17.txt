GEORGE: I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York. 
JERRY: First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody.   
KRAMER: Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China.. 
JERRY:  You better hurry. 
GEORGE: I'm gonna hit the head. 
KRAMER: Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York. 
JERRY:  Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.   
KRAMER: Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call. 
JERRY: She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year? 
KRAMER:  No, that wasn't dancing. 
JERRY:  Hey, there's Leo. 
KRAMER: Oh? Who's Leo? 
JERRY: Uncle Leo. 
KRAMER: Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name..   
JERRY: Did I just see that?! 
KRAMER:  Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, huh?       
WALTER:  So, Elaine.. are you going to dance this year? 
ELAINE: Maybe.. All over your face!   
WAITER: If you do dance, the cooks want to know - so they can be brought out of the kitchen. They missed it last year.   
PETERMAN: My friends, a toast. As the wolly-haired Melanasians of Papua, New Guinea once said,  All right! Who's dancing?  No one? Alright, I'll just have to get things started.    
ZACH: Hi, I'm Zach. 
ELAINE: Hi, I'm miserable.        
MANAGER: Excuse me, Sir. What are you doing? 
GEORGE:  I'm all set. 
MANAGER:  Did you take that book with you into the bathroom? 
GEORGE:  What do you want to hear?       
GEORGE: They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me.  How dare they?! I got news for you, if it wasn't for the toilet, there  would be no books. 
JERRY:  Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there. 
GEORGE: They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded by reading material. It's entrapment! 
JERRY:  'French Impressionist Paintings'? 
GEORGE: I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc- 
JERRY:  Thank you very much. 
GEORGE: Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie? 
JERRY: I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore. 
GEORGE:  Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to the man!   
JERRY: Sleeping in the caragain? 
ELAINE: Cocktail flu. 
JERRY:  Oh, right. The big party.. 
GEORGE: You, uh, didn't dance again, did you? 
ELAINE:  No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many.. 
GEORGE: You went home with him? 
ELAINE: Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down! 
JERRY:  Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything? 
ELAINE:  Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position? 
JERRY:  What's your position? 
ELAINE: I am an associate. 
GEORGE: Hey, me too.   
WAITRESS: Yeah, me too. 
ELAINE: Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank. 
GEORGE: Well, unless you tell everybody you're dating. 
ELAINE:  Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers. 
JERRY:  As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling. 
ELAINE:  Oh, bravo.       
JERRY:  Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches? 
KRAMER:  No, we've already eaten. 
NEWMAN:  But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way. 
KRAMER: Jerry, check this out.  Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen! 
JERRY:  No, you're not. 
KRAMER: Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office.. 
JERRY:  No, he doesn't. 
NEWMAN: He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss! 
JERRY: Yes, it can. 
KRAMER: We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, we're gonna have a whole fleet! 
NEWMAN: It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine. 
JERRY: So, who's gonna pull this thing?   
KRAMER:  Well, I just assumed you would. 
NEWMAN: Yeah, but I though- 
KRAMER:  Da-da-da-da no. 
JERRY:  My, isn't this an awkward moment? 
KRAMER:  What about the homeless? 
NEWMAN: Can't we worry about them later? 
KRAMER:  To pull the rickshaw. 
NEWMAN:  They do have an intimate knowledge of the street.. 
KRAMER: They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?! 
JERRY:  Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.       
LEO: Jerry, hello!  
JERRY: So, Leo, how's everything? You doin' Okay? 
LEO: I still have the ringing in the ears. Sounds like the phone. 
JERRY:  Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little? 
LEO: What, are you kidding? I should you loaning you money!  But I'm not. 
JERRY:  Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday. 
LEO: Why didn't ya say hello? 
JERRY: Because you were too busy stealing a book. 
LEO:  You still say hello. 
JERRY:  Leo, I saw you steal. 
LEO: Oh, they don't care. We all do it. 
JERRY: Who, criminals? 
LEO: Senior citizens. No big deal. 
JERRY: You could get arrested. 
LEO: Arrested? Come on!  I'm an old man. I'm confused! I thought I paid for it. What's my name? Will you take me  home? 
JERRY:  Leo.. 
LEO: Alright, alright. Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. You made your point. 
JERRY:  Thank you. 
LEO:  Will somebody answer that damn phone?!     
ELAINE:  Of course Zach and I have been dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank? 
WALTER: Well.. 
ELAINE: "Well"? We've been dating for three months. Between you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell.   
ELAINE:  Oh man. Ugh.. 
WALTER:  Isn't that Zach? 
ELAINE: Yeah. 
WALTER: Aren't you upset? 
ELAINE:  Yes. Oh, man! Oh!       
KRAMER: Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated,  hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws.  Now, I don't caer where you're  from, or how you got here, or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit.    HOMELESS MAN: The government! 
KRAMER:  Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body.   Or a shirt.. 
NEWMAN: Alright, who's first?   
KRMAER: Hey. 
NEWMAN: Name, please.  HOMELESS MAN: Rusty. 
NEWMAN:  Rusty. 
KRAMER:  You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence. 
NEWMAN:  Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what you've got! Ok? Ready, and  go!   
KRAMER:  Giddy up! Good form. 
NEWMAN:  Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're gonna have to do this all day for very little money.   
KRAMER: Hey, what's he doin'? 
NEWMAN: I think he stealing our rickshaw! 
KRAMER: Well, then, he's out!    HOMELESS MAN 2:  I'll take the job. Potato salad!"       
GEORGE: Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book. 
CASHIER:  I'm sorry, we can't take this book back. 
GEORGE: Why not? 
CASHIER: It's been flagged. 
GEORGE:  Flagged? 
CASHIER: It's been in the bathroom. 
GEORGE: It says that on the computer? 
CASHIER: Please take it home. We don't want it near the other books. 
GEORGE:  Well, you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read!   
JERRY:  I don't believe this!  Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with  shoplifting.. 
GUARD: Mm-hmm. Where's your uncle? 
JERRY:  He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight.. 
GAURD:  We have a 51-50 in paperbacks. All units respond. 
JERRY: '51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right? 
GUARD: Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to stand out of the way and let us handle this.  Swarm! Swarm!   
LEO: What?! I'm an old man! I'm confused! 
GUARD: You're under arrest. 
JERRY:  I just wanted you to scare him. 
LEO: Jerry, you ratted me out?! 
JERRY:  Hello? 
LEO: Hello.       
JERRY: Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight. 
HELEN: Jerry, he won't last a day in prison. 
JERRY:  Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine. 
MORTY: She's got priors. 
JERRY:  Prior convictions? Leo? 
HELEN: It was a crime of passion. Leave it alone. 
MORTY: Besides, it's not stealing if it's something you need. 
JERRY:  What does that mean? 
HELEN: Nobody pays for everyting. 
JERRY:  You're stealing too?! 
MORTY: Nothing. Batteries.  Well, they wear out so quick. 
JERRY: Mom, you too? 
HELEN: Sometimes your father forgets, so I have to steal them.   
JERRY: Alright, I'll talk to you later. 
KRAMER:  Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he , he bolted. 
JERRY:  Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months. 
KRAMER:  See, we should've gotten some collateral from him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans. 
NEWMAN: We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords.   
JERRY: To the Idiotmobile!       
JERRY: So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you? 
ELAINE: That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office- 
JERRY:  Tina Turner? 
ELAINE:  Alright.   
GEORGE: Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town! 
JERRY: Is it so horrible to have to keep a book? 
GEORGE: I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants. 
JERRY:  Not underpants. 
ELAINE: Hey, that's your Uncle Leo.   
JERRY:  Uncle Leo. Hello! 
LEO:  Jerry. 
JERRY:  Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your.. past. 
LEO:  You mean my crime of passion? If anyone betrays me, I never forget! 
JERRY:  Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!   
ELAINE: French impressionism. Oh, I love this.  Now, what is the problem with this book? 
GEORGE: Nothing. 
ELAINE: How much do you want for it? 
GEORGE: You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five.   
JERRY: Leo's furious.  What is that doing on the table? 
GEORGE:  Jerry, simmer down. 
JERRY:  I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book. 
ELAINE:  What is wrong with this book? 
GEORGE: Simmer! 
JERRY: That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and- 
ELAINE:  Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!!  
GEORGE:  May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom? 
JERRY: I don't read in the bathroom. 
GEORGE: Well, aren't you something?       
PETERMAN: Elaine, do you have a moment? It's about your lover. 
ELAINE:  Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room. 
PETERMAN: Elaine, who among us hasn't snuck into the break room to nibble on a love newton? 
ELAINE:  Love newton? 
PETERMAN: I'm afraid the problem with Zach is more serious. He's back on the horse, Elaine. Smack. White palace. The Chinaman's nightcap. 
ELAINE: An addict?  Well, it just keeps getting better! 
PETERMAN: And, in a tiny way, I almost feel responsible. I'm the one who sent him to Thailand - in search of low-cost whistles. Filled his head with pseudoerotic  tales of my own Opium excursions. Plus, I have him some phone numbers of places he could score near the hotel. 
ELAINE: Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me! 
PETERMAN: Damn it, Elaine. That wasn't Zach. That was the yam-yam. Now, he is going cold turkey.  And you will be at his side. 
ELAINE: Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh- 
PETERMAN:  No buts, Elaine. Or I will strip you of your 'associate' status.  Uh, P.S., the first twenty-four hours are the worst.  Better bring a poncho.       
HELEN: It was a crime of passion. 
LEO: If anyone betrays me, I never forget. 
HELEN: He won't last a day in prison.   
LEO:  Jerry. Hello. Jerry. Hello. Jerry.  Answer that damn phone!   
JERRY: Hello? 
ELAINE: Hey, it's me. 
JERRY: Uncle Leo? 
ELAINE:  Oh, that's nice. What are you up to? 
JERRY: Nightmares. You? 
ELAINE: My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals. 
ZACH:  I'm burning up! Elaine! 
ELAINE: Eat your soup! 
JERRY: You're not feeding him, are you? 
ELAINE: Why?  I told you, away from the curtains. Away.  Use your bucket.  There you go, that's it.  You know what? I gotta go.   
KRAMER: Hey, buddy. 
JERRY:  Ah! Kramer! 
KRAMER: I thought I heard you. 
JERRY: Get out of here! 
NEWMAN:  Kramer? Kramer?  There you are. 
JERRY: Will everybody please leave?! 
NEWMAN: I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in Battery Park. 
KRAMER: Our rickshaw? 
NEWMAN: It's entirely possible. 
JERRY: I want everyone out! 
KRAMER:  Let's talk in Jerry's kitchen. I'll make some cocoa. 
NEWMAN:  Good night. 
JERRY:  Good night, Newman.       
NEWMAN: There it is! 
KRAMER: Rusty! 
RUSTY: Oh, there you are. Oh, do I get the job? 
KRAMER:  Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you.  Let's get this baby home. 
NEWMAN: Uh.. 
KRAMER: What? 
NEWMAN: You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after all, it is a conveyance. 
KRAMER: Yes, that's true. 
NEWMAN: So, which one of us is gonna pull? 
KRAMER: Well, there's only one way to settle this.  One spot, two spot,  zig, zag, tear, pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scare 'em, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe.. 
NEWMAN:  Yeah. 
KRAMER: Best two out of three?  One spot, two spot..   
NEMWAN: Hey, boy. Smooth it out up there. Too much jostling!       
REBECCA:  So, you want to donate this to charity? 
GEORGE: Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off. 
REBECCA: What's the value of the book? 
GEORGE: Uh, about two hundred dollars, Miss DeMooney. 
REBECCA:  It's DeMornay. Rebecca DeMornay. 
GEORGE: Oh. 
REBECCA:  Oh, wait a second.  This book has been in the bathroom. 
GEORGE:  Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's rediculous. 
REBECCA: It's been flagged. I know. I used to work in a Brentano's. Mister, we're trying to help the homeless heare - it's bad enough that we have some nut out  there trying to strap 'em to a rickshaw! 
GEORGE:  Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. Do - do we have a deal? 
REBECCA: Yeah, and here it is: You get your toilet book out of here, and I won't jump over this counter and punch you in the brain! 
GEORGE: I could take it in merchandise.. 
REBECCA:  Here I come..         
ELAINE: So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere? 
CASHIER: Yeah. 
ELAINE: Great. 
JERRY:  So, the worst is over? 
ELAINE: Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm the office hero. 
JERRY: Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones. 
ELAIEN: Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho.   
ELAINE:  See ya. 
JERRY:  I'd like to speak with the manager, please.       
NEWMAN: Mind your pace, Boy. Chop, chop! 
KRAMER:  Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break.  
NEWMAN: Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is. 
KRAMER:  Oh..   
NEWMAN:  Boy.. Boy. Kramer!   
KRAMER: Woah! Wait! 
NEWMAN: Ahhh! Yaaaahhh!   
ZACH:  Well, this is the first day of the rest of my life!   
NEWMAN: Waaaaahhhh!         
JERRY: George? What are you doin' here? 
GEORGE: I can't sell the book. It's been marked. 
JERRY:  It certainly has. 
GEORGE: So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That way, everything is even. 
JERRY:  You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even? 
GEORGE: I'm goin' in!   
MANAGER: Did you want to speak with the manager? 
JERRY: Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day.. 
MANAGER: Yes, Uncle Leo. I remember him. I'm sorry, our policy is we prosecute all shoplifters. 
JERRY:  Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal. 
MANAGER: That's right. That's why we stopped carrying batteries. Look, I'll be honest with you, we've had a lot of trouble with theft lately - and my boss says I have to make an example to someone. 
JERRY: So it could be anyone? 
MANAGER: I.. guess. As long as we catch him in the act.   
JERRY: That guy!  Swarm! Swarm!   
GEORGE: No! Jerry!
