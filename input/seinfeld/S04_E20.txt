George: You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that? 
Jerry: Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and  shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened. 
George: So when're you gonna see her? 
Jerry: Tonight. 
George: What's her name? 
Jerry: I... don't... know... 
George: How could you not know her name? 
Jerry: I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do  with a car, or a fish...        
Jerry: Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day...        
George: Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the  State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public school  back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the  Lincoln Savings Bank. 
Jerry: Yeah, I did that too. 
George: You remember the, the little bank book, there? 
Jerry: Sure. 
George: Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I  completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks  me down. The interest has accumulated to 1 900 dollars. 1 900  dollars! They're sending me a cheque! 
Jerry: Wow! 
George: Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without  doing anything... 
Jerry: Y'know I have friends who try to base their whole life on that  principle. 
George: Really? Who? 
Jerry: Nobody you know...       
George: Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse... 
Jerry: Why don't you put it in the *bank*? 
George: The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna  make a big score! 
Jerry: *Oh*, you mean you wanna *lose* it...        
George: What's with the gloves? 
Kramer: Well, I'm staining my floors and, y'know, I don't want to get my  hands dirty... 
George: What, the whole apartment? 
Kramer: The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm  gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin.  'Cuz I *need* wood around me. Wood, Jerry ... Wood.        
Jerry: What, you rented "Home Alone"? 
George: Yeah. 
Jerry: I thought you saw that already... 
George: No, I saw "Home Alone II". 
Jerry: Oh, right... But you *hated* it! 
George: Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, do you  mind if I watch it here? 
Jerry: What for? 
Jerry: Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing  anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house; I'm doing  something.        
Kramer: I can't work with these! 
Jerry: What's wrong? 
Kramer: Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no *fine touch*... 
Jerry: You said "gloves"... 
Kramer: No, no, these are too thick.       
Kramer: Oooh, is that "Home Alone"? 
George: Yeah. The *original*.        
Elaine: Hey Boys-O!        
Elaine: Remember Roy, the artist? 
Jerry: Right, the "triangle" guy. 
Elaine: Exactly, the "triangle" guy. 
Jerry: Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him? 
Elaine: Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was just a little too... 
Jerry: Artsy? 
Elaine: Fat. 
Jerry: Oh. 
Elaine: He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare. Anyway,  he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go  visit him.        
Elaine: Listen, Jerry can you do me a favour? Could you go into the room  with me to visit him because I don't want him to think that I'm,  y'know... interested. 
Jerry: Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend. 
Elaine: Well... 
Jerry: Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before  to some critical acclaim.        
Elaine: What's with him? 
Jerry: Y'know a lot of people have asked that...        
Elaine: Roy! 
Roy: *Elaine*! What a *surprise*. 
Elaine: Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognise you! You look so... 
Roy: I've lost some weight... 
Elaine: A *lot* of weight. 
Roy: I know. 
Elaine: You look ter*rific*. 
Roy: Thank you. So do you.        
Elaine: This is... uh... you *really* lost weight. 
Roy: Thank you.        
Jerry: Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend.        
Woman: Waaaaaaaaa!        
Kramer: Ah, the mother lode!        
Elaine: I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't  even get my arms around you... 
Roy: Yes, I remember.        
Elaine: Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose  weight. 
Roy: Elaine, it wasn't the illness. It was you.        
Roy: After you stopped seeing me, I was devastated. I couldn't eat for  weeks. 
Elaine: *Get* *out*! 
Roy: Really, it's the truth. 
Elaine: Jerry, did you hear that? He couldn't eat for weeks... 
Jerry: That's terrible...       
Elaine: I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you. 
Roy: You did.       
Jerry: You know I can't get this damn thing to sleep...        
Elaine: Now listen, tell me something. When are you gettin out of here? 
Roy: Next Thursday. 
Elaine: Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for  a *big* meal because *you* are getting *too* thin...        
Jerry: Honey... Aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday? 
Elaine: No that's the week after. 
Jerry: No, I believe it's next week. 
Elaine: You're wrong. 
Jerry: No I'm not... 
Elaine: Shut up...        
Kramer: Pay dirt!       
Elaine: Uh Roy, this is Kramer-- he's one of our friends. 
Roy: How do you do? 
Kramer: I do great.        
Doctor: Hi Roy. 
Roy: Oh, hey Dr. Siegel. 
Jerry: Hey Doc, check this out.  I *just*  learned that.        
Doctor: I just wanted to stop by to see if you had any questions about  tomorrow's operation. 
Kramer: Yeah, I have a question. What do you know about inter-abdominal  retractors? 
Doctor: Are you asking because you saw "20/20" last night? 
Kramer: I sure am. 
Doctor: Well that report was about *one* very specific type of retractor  and I can assure you we do not use that kind type of retractor in  your friend's procedure. 
Kramer: But you *will* use... a retractor. 
Doctor: We have to... 
Kramer: Mmm-hmm...        
Doctor: Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's  welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's  operation from the viewing gallery. How would you like to watch it  with them? 
Kramer: I'd love to watch the operation, yeah! 
Jerry: I dunno... 
Kramer: Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're gonna cut  him open. His guts'll be all over the place... 
Jerry: Yeah, that's true... 
Kramer: ...They'll saw through bone.  You'll see what's *inside* bone...        
Jerry: Hey. 
George: Hi... 
Jerry: What are doing, you crying?? 
George: No... 
Jerry: You crying from "Home Alone"?? 
George: The old man got to me. 
Jerry: Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends  with you anymore after this display 
George: Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway? 
Jerry: Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves and wanted  to get home and start working on his floor.       
George: How's the guy? 
Jerry: Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting pretty chummy.  Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art. 
George: That's nerve... 
Jerry: Yeah, so she and "Triangle Boy" can go out to fancy restaurants.       
George: Y'know what it is? It's "Clara Nightingale Syndrome". He falls  ill; she falls in love. 
Jerry: You mean Florence Nightingale. 
George: What'd I say? Clara? 
Jerry: Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton. 
George: Clara Barton? What did she do? 
Jerry: I'm not sure, but I think she was nice. 
George: Susan B. Anthony I think I'd have a problem with. 
Jerry: Yeah, I think you would.       
George: So, you gonna buy his art? 
Jerry: No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1 900 dollars. 
George: Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta here.  Have fun with what's-her-name. 
Jerry: I will. 
George: Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing. 
Jerry: No, it isn't. I can find out. 
George: Yeah? How? 
Jerry: There are ways.        
Jerry: Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would make fun  of my name like you wouldn't believe-- "Jerry Jerry Dingleberry",  "Seinsmelled"... 
Woman: "Seinsmelled"? 
Jerry: Yeah. What about you? Did people make fun of your name? 
Woman: Are you kidding? They were merciless! What do you expect when your  name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy? Of course, not  everybody can be as sweet as you are.        
Woman: Oh, Jerry... 
Jerry: Oh... *you*...        
George: Now let's try "breast"... Celeste... Kest... 
Jerry: No. 
George: Rest... Sest... Hest... 
Jerry: "Hest"? That's not a name. 
George: What, you should've just asked her. 
Jerry: I know, I should've asked her. 
George: What're you gonna do now? 
Jerry: I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once  you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name. 
George: Aretha! 
Jerry: No... 
George: Bovary! 
Jerry: Alright, that's enough.       
George: Alright, well you know what you gotta do, you gotta go through her  purse. Y'know, the credit cards, driver's license... 
Jerry: How am I gonna do that? 
George: When she goes to the bathroom.       
Kramer: Ah, there you are. My date stood me up. Listen, will you guys  go to the operation with me? 
Jerry: You asked a date to go to the operation? 
Kramer: Yeah... So c'mon, what d'you say? 
George: What kind of operation is it? 
Kramer: Spleenectomy. 
George: Isn't that where they remove the-- 
Kramer: Don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet!        
Kramer: C'mon, what d'you say? 
George: Mulva! 
Jerry: Mulva? 
Kramer: C'mon, do you wanna go? 
Jerry: Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll go  watch them slice this fat bastard up.        
Doctor: Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity, exposing the body's internal  organs. Nurse-- retractor.        
Jerry: What are you eating? 
Kramer: Junior Mints. Do you want one? 
Jerry: No... 
Kramer: I can't see... Psst....        
Jerry: Where'd you get those? 
Kramer: The machine. You want one? Here, take one. 
Jerry: I don't want any! 
Kramer: No, they're good! 
Jerry: I don't want any! 
Kramer: Just take one. 
Jerry: No! Kramer, stop it!        
Jerry: ...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into* the  patient! 
George: What do you mean "into the patient"? 
Jerry: Into the patient, *literally*! 
George: Into the hole? 
Jerry: Yes, the hole! 
George: Didn't they notice it? 
Jerry: No! 
George: How could they not notice it?!? 
Jerry: Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.       
George: What did they do? 
Jerry: They sealed him up with the mint inside. 
George: They *left* the Junior Mint *in* him? 
Jerry: Yes! 
George: I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things. 
Jerry: They *eat* them, they don't put them next to vital organs in their  abdominal cavity!        
Kramer: Hey, this wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like a ski  lodge! 
Jerry: Why did you force that mint on me? I didn't want the mint! 
Kramer: Well, I didn't believe you. 
Jerry: How could you not believe me?!? 
Kramer: Who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's  peppermint-- it's *delicious*! 
Jerry: That's true. 
Kramer: It's very refreshing! 
Jerry: Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...        
Elaine: Prognosis... negative. 
Jerry: Prognosis *negative*!? 
Elaine: He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're  baffled.  J+K: Oh, my God...       
Elaine: Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive.  Y'know Jerry, you should buy some of his art. That would really  lift his spirits. 
George: It's that bleak? 
Elaine: Mmm...        
George: Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something...        
Jerry: We gotta confess. 
Kramer: Really? 
Jerry: Yes! 
Kramer: We could be tried for murder... 
Jerry: I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb! 
Kramer: You're not gonna say anything, you got that? 
Jerry: I'm telling and you can't stop me! 
Kramer: You're *not*!!!        
George: Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1 900 dollars worth.        
Jerry: Oh yeah, that's the spot... 
Woman: What're you so tense about? 
Jerry: Oh, nothing really... Just a homicide.  Oh that's terrific... Mulva. 
Woman: What? 
Jerry: Mulva? 
Woman: Mulva? 
Jerry: My Aunt's name is Mulva. She's a masseuse. 
Woman: I'm going to the bathroom. Be right back. 
Jerry: Oh, good idea...        
Woman: What are you doing? 
Jerry: Oh, I was just looking for some... gum or... mint. 
Woman: Oh, I have Junior Mints. 
Jerry: No!  No, I mean, no thank you...        
Kramer: Any news? 
Jerry:  No, you better get out of here. No, wait a second...  Wait a second... I don't know the name of this woman in the  bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then  she'll be forced to say her name. 
Kramer: 10-4. 
Woman: Oh, hello. 
Kramer: Hello, I'm Kramer. 
Woman: Nice to meet you. 
Kramer: See you later.         
Woman: Well, I better get going. I don't want to be late for the play.  Y'know my cousin knows the producer. I may get to go backstage  and meet Olympia Dukakis. 
Jerry: Hey, there's a name you don't forget.        
Woman: Oh, hi. 
George: Hi, I'm George. 
Woman: Nice to meet you, George.        
George: I gave it a shot... So, any word on the "artiste"? 
Jerry: No, I haven't heard anything. 
George: Well, I got my triangles. 
Jerry: Really... 
George: Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment. 
Jerry: Yeah, I'm sure...       
Jerry: Well, I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened. 
George: No, Jerry. I wouldn't do that. 
Jerry: Why? 
George: You could get in trouble. 
Jerry: Look, I gotta try and help the guy. 
George: Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his number  is up, who are you to interfere!? 
Jerry: Yes I'd like to speak to Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's  condition... 
George: What? What? 
Jerry: Oh, thats *fantastic*! 
George: He didn't get better, did he? 
Jerry: Thank you very much. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay! 
George: Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1 900 dollars down the drain.        
Roy: You saved my life, George. You buying my art is what inspired me  to get better. I'll never forget what you did for me. 
George: Oh, that's great. That's great. 
Kramer: Y'know, art is a great investment. 
Elaine: It's gonna look great in your apartment, George. 
George: Yes I look forward to many years of looking at the triangles.  Well, I'll wait for you outside. 
Roy: Hey, George...        
Doctor: Y'know I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in  your recovery, but I think there were other factors at play here. 
Jerry: What do you mean? 
Doctor: I have no medical evidence to back me up, but something happened  during the operation that staved off that infection. Something  beyond science. Something perhaps from above... 
Kramer: Mint? 
Doctor: Those can be very refreshing.        
Roy: So Elaine... Where are we going for our big dinner on Friday? 
Elaine: I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we're going to the Poconos on  Friday, right honey? ] 
Jerry: I don't think so... 
Elaine: We are... 
Jerry: I believe we're not... 
Elaine:  Please can we go to  the Poconos? 
Jerry: Well, I'll think about it...        
Woman: Great seats. You could see the actors spitting. 
Jerry: Really... 
Woman: And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my  playbill. 
Jerry: Oh, what're you saying, you got her autograph? 
Woman: Yeah. 
Jerry: Do you have it with you? 
Woman: Yeah, it's in my purse. 
Jerry: Let me see. 
Woman: Y'know I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld. 
Woman: Oh, well, I really think I'm falling for you...   ...Joseph Puglia... 
Woman: I had it autographed for my uncle. 
Jerry: Yeah, I know... 
Woman: You don't know my name, do you? 
Jerry: Yes I do. 
Woman: What is it? 
Jerry: It, uh, rhymes with a female body part. 
Woman: What is it? 
Jerry: Mulva...        
Jerry: Gipple?        
Jerry: Loleola?        
Jerry: Oh! Oh! *Delores*!
