KRAMER: Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS walk. 
ELAINE: Is that tomorrow? 
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...  
ELAINE : Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS. 
KRAMER: Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself.  
JERRY : It's hard enough living next door. 
KRAMER: I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby.  I'll be right back.   
ELAINE: New jeans? 
JERRY: Yeah. 
ELAINE: Still a 31 waist? 
JERRY: Yep. Since college.  Hey, Lena Small's on this list. 
ELAINE: Lena Small? 
JERRY: Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number. 
ELAINE: Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list!  
JERRY : Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring to date a giving person. 
ELAINE: You're a taking person. 
JERRY: That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam.  
ELAINE : She's gonna ask how you got her number. 
JERRY: Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me. 
ELAINE: What's he look like? 
JERRY: I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat. 
ELAINE: You're buying a speedboat? 
JERRY: See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number.  All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free. 
ELAINE: I don't know about that. 
JERRY: So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him? 
ELAINE: Well... 
JERRY: Yeah. So you really like this guy. 
ELAINE: Very much. 
JERRY: How's the...sexual chemistry? 
ELAINE: Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today.  
KRAMER: Are you still on the pill? 
ELAINE: Uh, Kramer... 
KRAMER: I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum. 
ELAINE: The sponge, o.k.? The Today sponge. 
KRAMER: But wasn't that taken off the market? 
ELAINE: Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge. 
KRAMER: I read it in Wall Street Week...Louis, uh, Rukeyser.       
JERRY: Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat...     
SUSAN: You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's really thin. 
GEORGE: Not as thin as you think. 
SUSAN: Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back. 
GEORGE: The tag, huh? 
SUSAN: Mmm-hmm. 
GEORGE: Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's just leave it at that. 
SUSAN: What are you talking about? 
GEORGE: He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31. 
SUSAN: Oh, how could he be so vain? 
GEORGE: Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that.  
SUSAN : Why not? 
GEORGE: Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know. 
SUSAN: Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell me everything. 
GEORGE: Where did you get that from? 
SUSAN: Well, we're a couple. It's understood. 
GEORGE: I never heard of that. 
SUSAN: Well, you've never been a couple. 
GEORGE: I've coupled! I've coupled! 
SUSAN: Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code. 
GEORGE: This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop!   
GEORGE: Hey. 
JERRY: Hey. What's the matter? 
GEORGE: I had a fight with Susan. 
JERRY: What about? 
GEORGE: Oh... ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today? 
JERRY: I got a date with that girl, Lena. 
GEORGE: Lena, how'd you meet her? 
JERRY: I actually met her a few weeks ago, but...  
GEORGE: You met her a few weeks ago, but...?  
JERRY : I didn't call her till today. 
GEORGE: So, uh...wanna double? 
JERRY: What? 
GEORGE: Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic. 
JERRY: I dunno.  Hey. 
ELAINE: Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market. 
JERRY: So what are you gonna do? 
ELAINE: I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius. 
GEORGE: Just for these sponges? 
ELAINE: Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use? 
GEORGE: I dunno. 
ELAINE: You don't know? 
GEORGE: I, uh...figure it's something.  
JERRY: What are you all out of breath from?  
KRAMER : The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights. 
JERRY: And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape. 
KRAMER: Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you! 
JERRY: I got a 31 waist, mister! 
KRAMER: Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?  
JERRY : What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers.  
PHARMACIST: Can I help you?  
ELAINE : Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but... 
PHARMACIST: Actually, we have a case left.  
ELAINE : A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case? 
PHARMACIST: Sixty. 
ELAINE: Sixty?! Uh...well, I'll take three. 
PHARMACIST: Three. 
ELAINE: Make it ten. 
PHARMACIST: Ten? 
ELAINE: Twenty sponges should be plenty. 
PHARMACIST: Did you say twenty? 
ELAINE: Yeah, twenty-five sponges is just fine. 
PHARMACIST: Right. So, you're set with twenty-five. 
ELAINE: Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.  
JERRY: Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my shirt.  LENA : Mmm! Very nice. 
JERRY: It's All-Tempa-Cheer. 
LENA: I use Planet. It's bio-degradable and doesn't pollute the oceans. 
GEORGE: Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy.  
LENA : Can you wrap up all the left-overs on the table, please? I always take the left-overs. I work in a soup kitchen every morning at 6 a.m. 
JERRY: They serve soup at 6 a.m.? 
LENA: Yeah. That's all they have. 
JERRY: Do the bums ever complain? "Soup again?" 
GEORGE: I'd get tired of it. 
JERRY: How could you not? 
LENA: Guess who volunteered last week? 
GEORGE: Mick Jagger. 
LENA: No. Maya Angelou. 
SUSAN: Oh, the poet!  
JERRY : So, let me ask you something - these people eat soup three times a day? 
LENA: I don't know.  
SUSAN : So, did you get to talk to her? 
LENA: Talk to who? 
JERRY: Is it a lot of cream soups? 
SUSAN: Maya Angelou, the poet. 
LENA: No, I didn't get the chance. 
GEORGE: Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?   
SUSAN: I'm going to the ladies room. 
LENA: I'll go with you.  
GEORGE: What are you looking at me like that for? 
JERRY: Why'd you have to mention 'unlisted number'? 
GEORGE: What are you talking about? 
JERRY: Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan.    
SUSAN: Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's awful! 
GEORGE: I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you. 
SUSAN: But you told me anyway? 
GEORGE: Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule. 
SUSAN: Thank you, honey. 
GEORGE: So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially? 
SUSAN: Can we stop by a drug store first? 
GEORGE: What for? 
SUSAN: I'm out of birth control stuff. 
GEORGE: Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...?  
SUSAN: Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in. 
GEORGE: Me run in? Why don't you run in? 
SUSAN: You don't know what I use for birth control, do you? 
GEORGE: Of course I do. 
SUSAN: You do? What? 
GEORGE: You know. You use the, uh... 
SUSAN: The what? 
GEORGE: You know, the uh... 
SUSAN: Just get me some sponges, please. 
GEORGE: Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found out, they just took them off the market. 
SUSAN: Off the market? The sponge? 
GEORGE: Yeah, so you gotta use something else. 
SUSAN: I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge! 
GEORGE: O.k.... I think I know where we can get one.  
JERRY: Kramer, what the hell is going on in there? 
KRAMER: It's a poker game... And I'm kickin' some serious butt! 
JERRY: Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!  
VOICE FROM POKER GAME: Hey, Kramer - are you in? 
KRAMER: Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? Do they look scared?! 
JERRY: You're never gonna make it!       
BILLY: You, uh...you wanna go in the bedroom? 
ELAINE: O.k. Hold on just a second.  
GEORGE: Elaine? It's me, George.  Hey, sorry to bother you so late.  Hey! How ya doin.'  Uh, did you get any of those sponges? 
ELAINE: Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why? 
GEORGE: Well...Susan. 
ELAINE: Ah, Susan uses the sponge. 
GEORGE: Susan loves the sponge. 
ELAINE: Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out. 
GEORGE: What? 
ELAINE: I can't do it. No way, there's no how.  
GEORGE: Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex? 
ELAINE: Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry.  
GEORGE: Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left. 
ELAINE: I'm sure you'll have another fight, George.   Hold that thought!       
SUSAN: So, listen to this. But don't tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He got a woman's number off an AIDS walk list.   
MONICA: He got her number off an AIDS walk list?   
LENA: He what?      
JERRY: How'd you find out? 
LENA: A friend of a friend of a friend of Susan's. 
JERRY: George! 
LENA: Pardon? 
JERRY: Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I just - 
LENA: It's o.k.! There's nothing to be sorry about. I don't mind. 
JERRY: You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list? 
LENA: No, not at all. No problem.  
KRAMER: Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on! 
JERRY: You went all night?  
KRAMER : Jerry, ah? Breakfast on me, huh? 
JERRY: Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it! 
KRAMER: AIDS walk! That's a cake walk.  Hey! 
JERRY: So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number. 
GEORGE: Really? How'd she do that? 
JERRY: A friend of a friend of Susan's. 
GEORGE: My Susan? 
JERRY: Why'd you tell her?! 
GEORGE: Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything! 
JERRY: Well you know what this means, don't you? 
GEORGE: What?    
JERRY: You're cut off, you're out of the loop! 
GEORGE: You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off! 
JERRY: You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned! 
GEORGE: C'mon Jerry, please! It won't happen again. 
JERRY: If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone? 
GEORGE: Hey, a "hit" is a totally different story. 
JERRY: I don't know, George. 
GEORGE: So, Lena was upset, huh? 
JERRY: You know what? That was the amazing thing. 
GEORGE: What, it didn't bother her? 
JERRY: No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl. 
GEORGE: What? 
JERRY: She's too good. 
GEORGE: Too good... 
JERRY: I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that! 
GEORGE: I see what you mean. 
JERRY: I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire. 
GEORGE: Where's the depravity? 
JERRY: No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex.    
JERRY : On the other hand... 
ELAINE: What?  
GEORGE : Thanks again for last night! 
ELAINE: Hey, I didn't even use one. 
JERRY: I thought you said it was imminent. 
ELAINE: Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy. 
JERRY: Sponge-worthy? 
ELAINE: Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges. 
JERRY: But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for? 
ELAINE: Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em. 
GEORGE: You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!     
KRAMER : Uh, Cosmo Kramer? 
ORGANIZER: Uh...o.k., you're checked in. Here's your AIDS ribbon. 
KRAMER: Uh, no thanks. 
ORGANIZER: You don't want to wear an AIDS ribbon? 
KRAMER: No. 
ORGANIZER: But you have to wear an AIDS ribbon. 
KRAMER: I have to? 
ORGANIZER: Yes. 
KRAMER: See, that's why I don't want to. 
ORGANIZER: But everyone wears the ribbon. You must wear the ribbon! 
KRAMER: You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully.  
ORGANIZER: Hey you! Come back here! Come back here and put this on!     
GEORGE: Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of them. 
SUSAN: Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms. 
GEORGE: Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever. 
SUSAN: Just once...for the make-up sex. 
GEORGE: Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that. 
SUSAN: Come on, just once? 
GEORGE: No, no...I hate the condom. 
SUSAN: Why? 
GEORGE: I can never get the package open in time. 
SUSAN: Well, you just tear it open. 
GEORGE: It's not that easy. It's like "Beat The Clock," there's a lot of pressure there.     
WALKER #1: Hey, where's your ribbon? 
KRAMER: Oh, I don't wear the ribbon.  
WALKER #2: Oh, you don't wear the ribbon? Aren't you against AIDS? 
KRAMER: Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon.  
WALKER #3: Who do you think you are?  
WALKER #1: Put the ribbon on!  
WALKER #2: Hey, Cedric! Bob! This guy won't wear a ribbon!  
BOB: Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon?      
ELAINE: So, you think you're sponge-worthy? 
BILLY: Yes, I think I'm sponge-worthy. I think I'm very sponge-worthy. 
ELAINE: Run down your case for me again...? 
BILLY: Well, we've gone out several times, we obviously have a good rapport. I own a very profitable electronics distributing firm. I eat well. I exercise. Blood tests - immaculate. And if I can speak frankly, I'm actually quite good at it. 
ELAINE: You going to do something about your sideburns? 
BILLY: Yeah, I told you...I'm going to trim my sideburns. 
ELAINE: And the bathroom in your apartment? 
BILLY: Cleaned it this morning. 
ELAINE: The sink, the tub, everything got cleaned? 
BILLY: Everything, yeah. It's spotless. 
ELAINE: Alright, let's go.      
JERRY: Hi. 
LENA: Hi! Hey, look at this - I just got a citation in the mail for my work with shut-ins. 
JERRY: Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime. 
LENA: Oh, by the way, I checked at the soup kitchen - they do have cream soups. 
JERRY: Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person - 
LENA: Oh, hang onto that thought - I'm rinsing a sweater, I left the water running.  Hey, Jerry, can you get me a towel out of my bedroom closet? 
JERRY: Oh, o.k.   
JERRY'S brain: Oh my god! Look what's goin' on here! She is depraved!  There you are. 
LENA: Thanks. So, you were saying...? 
JERRY: What? Nothing. 
LENA: No, you said I was a good person... 
JERRY: Oh... 
LENA: You seem like you want to tell me something. 
JERRY: Tell you something...I do. 
LENA: What is it, Jerry? You can tell me anything. 
JERRY: Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing? 
LENA: Yeah. 
JERRY: I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it.      
SUSAN: Come on, George, just tear it open. 
GEORGE: I'm trying, dammit. 
SUSAN: Tear it. 
GEORGE: I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips. 
SUSAN: Here give it to me. 
GEORGE: Would you wait a second? Just wait?  
SUSAN: Give it to me.  Come on. Come on!  
GEORGE : It's too late.     
BOB: So! What's it going to be? Are you going to wear the ribbon?  
KRAMER : No! Never. 
BOB: But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all wearing the ribbon! So why aren't you going to wear the ribbon!? 
KRAMER: This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear! 
CEDRIC: What are we gonna do with him? 
BOB: I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon!       
JERRY: It completely turned her off. 
GEORGE: Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size? 
JERRY: I don't wanna be a 32. 
GEORGE: I'd kill to be a 32. 
JERRY: She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me! 
GEORGE: That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open? 
JERRY: It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind. 
GEORGE: You never run out, do you?  Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here. 
JERRY: Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?   
JERRY: Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on.  
GEORGE: Hey, where's you AIDS ribbon?      
ELAINE : Good morning. 
BILLY: How'd you sleep?  
ELAINE : Great. You? 
BILLY: Fine, fine. Everything o.k.? 
ELAINE: Yep. 
BILLY: No regrets? 
ELAINE: Nope.  What are you doing? 
BILLY: What do you mean? 
ELAINE: Oh...I don't think so. 
BILLY: Why not? I thought you said everything was fine. 
ELAINE: I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em.
