Jerry: "I think that's eat 24 hours before surgery." 
Kramer: "Oh no, you got to eat before surgery, you need your strength." 
Wilhem: "I called this meeting because we......have........a problem. For  the last few months someone has been stealing equipment from the  club. Until recently it's been little things, y'know; bases,  batting helmets, donuts, but two nights ago they pulled the big one. "     The camera goes back and forth from Wilhem to George who keeps pulling on  his collar he's sweating. 
Wilhem: "They took a pitching machine, a batting cage ,the in-field tarp and  all of Mr Steinbrenner's vitamins.. Now , we have reasons to  believe it's an inside job." 
George: " Whoa!!" 
Wilhem: "If anybody here knows anything about it I recommend strongly  that...you come forward."  
Receptionist: "Dr Whatley's running a little late. If you'd like to take a  seat, I'll call you when he's ready."

Elaine: "Able Mentally Challenged Adults" 
Jerry: "Naaaaaa...I can't watch a man sing a song." 
Elaine: "What are you..crazy?"

Jerry: "I don't think so." 
Elaine: "Yeah yeah! He's really handsome with those..."

Elaine: "You can't find beauty in a man?"

Kramer: "Hey!"
