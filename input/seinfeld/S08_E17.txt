JERRY: You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession stand? 
ELAINE: Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo? 
JERRY: He's wailing on that banjo. 
ELAINE: Yeah. 
JERRY: I just don't understand the raisinettes. 
ELAINE: The sax player? 
JERRY: Yeah. 
ELAINE: Yeah. 
JERRY: The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes. 
ELAINE: So? 
JERRY: Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse. 
ELAINE: HE's not gonna eat them. He's buying 'em for his Pepsi girlfriend. 
JERRY: Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children. 
ELAINE: He's a musician. 
JERRY: Musicians. Get a real job.      
WAITRESS: What d'you want? 
GEORGE: Ah, I've had everything on the menu. Uh, surprise me.  
DANIELLE:  Neil.  
DANIELLE: Neil.  
DANIELLE:  Oh, I am sorry.  I'm supposed to meet my boyfriend here. He looks just like you. 
GEORGE:  Really? 
DANIELLE:  Yeah. 
GEORGE:  Like me? 
DANIELLE: Uh-huh. Sorry.  
GEORGE:  Like me? But how?  
WAITRESS: Here's your halibut omelette. Surprised? 
GEORGE: Yes, yes, I am.     
KRAMER: Look what I got for you, for your Florida trip. Crazy Shirts was closing 'em out. I got a dozen for a buck.  K
KRAMER: Saved a fortune. Look at that. Heyy. 
JERRY:  Ohh, 'Number 1 Dad'. 
KRAMER: Yeah. 
JERRY:  Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect.  
KRAMER: Hey. 
GEORGE: Hey. 
JERRY: Hey. 
GEORGE: Hey. You ready? 
JERRY: Almost. 
KRAMER: Okay, look, uh, when you're in Florida, can my cigar guy drop off some Cubans for me at your parents' house? 
JERRY:  Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new condo. I'm gonna be busy. 
KRAMER: Aw, c'mon man. Help a brother out. 
JERRY:  Alright. 
KRAMER: Yeahh. I owe you one. 
JERRY:  We're even.  
GEORGE: Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop, and this beautiful girl I could never even talk to, mistakes me for her boyfriend. 
JERRY:  That's a nice four seconds. 
GEORGE:  I look just like him. I. Me.  This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible? 
JERRY: Maybe he has money. 
GEORGE:  Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same, except for one minor, yet crucial, detail. You never know. 
JERRY:  Sometimes you do. 
GEORGE: Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a..or a cane. 
JERRY:  Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?  
GEORGE:  She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend.  
BLAINE: So, what d'you wanna see? 
ELAINE:  What about Sack Lunch? 
BLAINE:  How about The English Patient? It's up for all those Oscars.  
ELAINE: Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch. 
BLAINE: It's a family in a brown paper bag. 
ELAINE:  Don't you wanna know how they got in there? 
BLAINE: No.  
ELAINE:  Aww. Sold out. 
BLAINE:  Oh, two for The English Patient.  
ELAINE: So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack?      
GEORGE:  Uh, hi. Uhm, remember me? I..I'm the guy who looks like Neil? 
DANIELLE:  Hi. 
GEORGE: Huh-Hi.  Uhm, is Neil here? 
DANIELLE: Oh, no. He got held up at work. 
GEORGE: Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how we look so similar. 
DANIELLE: Well, you know, you don't look that much like him. 
GEORGE:  Oh. Course not. 
DANIELLE: No, you're a little taller.  
DANIELLE: You look like you're in better shape than Neil. Do you work out? 
GEORGE:  Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward...  
GEORGE: ...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number?  
ELAINE:  Why is everyone talking about "The English Patient, it's so romantic".  God, that movie stunk! 
BLAINE: I kinda liked it. 
ELAINE:  No you didn't.  From the exit emerge several of Elaine's friends, who hurry over to see her. They're all holding tissues. 
CAROL: Elaine. Elaine, did you just see The English Patient? 
GAIL:  Didn't you love it? 
LISA: How could you not love that movie? 
ELAINE: How about, it sucked? 
CAROL: That Ralph Fiennes, I would give up my firstborn for him. 
ELAINE:  Huhh, getting the short end of that stick.  
MORTY: Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's new physical fitness room. They got medicine balls, you can bike ride, anything you want. 
JERRY: Stairmaster? 
MORTY: What? 
JERRY: Nothin'. 
MORTY:  See what I'm wearing?  Morty has on the '#1 DAD' shirt. 
JERRY: Oh, did you get that outta my bag? 
MORTY: No, your mother found it. Son, this is the most wonderful and thoughtful thing you've ever done for me. 
JERRY: You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice.   
MORTY: Hoh, here he is. This is the man I wanted you to see. Izzy Mandelbaum. He's eighty years old, but strong as an ox.  Watch this.  
MORTY: See that? You couldn't do that. 
JERRY: I could, but I choose not to.  
SID: Hey Morty.  Who's this? 
MORTY: This is my son Jerry, from New York.  He thinks he can lift more than Izzy. 
JERRY:  I..I didn't say that. 
SID:  Hey, Izzy, this kid says he can lift more than you can.  
IZZY: Your kid's pretty funny, Morty. Should be a comedian. 
JERRY:  Actually, I am a comedian. 
SID: That's not so funny. 
IZZY:  Think you're better than me, huh? 
MORTY: Izzy used to work out with Charles Atlas in the fifties. 
JERRY:  Eighteen-fifties? 
IZZY: Yeah, that's it. It's go time.  Let's see you lift that. 
JERRY:  Mr Mandelbaum, I... 
IZZY: C'mon, c'mon. Pump it! 
JERRY:  Alright. 
IZZY: Yeah, wrong attitude. you're not bringing that trash into my house.  
JERRY: There. Alright? 
IZZY: Step aside, stringbean.  
IZZY: I'll show you. We're gonna take it up a notch.  
IZZY:  Ah! My back. Ugh.  
IZZY:  Aaaahh.  Jerry, Morty and Sid, look on, concerned. 
SID: Somebody, call an ambulance. 
MORTY:  There's already an ambulance here for Mrs Glickman. There's room for one more.     
ELAINE:  Okay, one for Sack Lunch.  It's good, right?  Yeah, good.  
ELAINE:  Hey, what're you guys doing here? 
LISA: We just saw The English Patient again. 
GAIL: It's even better the second time. 
ELAINE: They make it longer?  Out of the theatre comes Blaine, carrying an umbrella. 
BLAINE:  Got my umbrella. 
ELAINE:  Blaine!? 
BLAINE: Elaine. 
ELAINE: I thought you were busy tonight. 
BLAINE:  Well, to tell you the truth Elaine. I don't know if I can be with someone who doesn't like The English Patient. 
ELAINE: It's just a stupid movie. 
BLAINE:  That's what I'm talking about. 
CAROL:  Come on, Blaine. Let's go. 
BLAINE:  Enjoy Sack Lunch!  
ELAINE:  I will!     
HELEN:  How could you do that to Mr Mandelbaum? You should be ashamed of yourself. 
JERRY:  He egged me on. 
HELEN: You should be more mature. 
JERRY: He's eighty! 
MORTY:  Okay. Tomorrow, Jerry and I will visit Izzy and apologise. Now, goodnight.   
HELEN:  You're not sleeping in that shirt. It's too tight. 
MORTY: This shirt will never leave my body.  
HELEN:  Goodnight. 
JERRY:  Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself.  
GUILLERMO: Jerry Seinfeld please. 
JERRY: Ah, you must be Kramer's guys.  Come on in. You got the cigars?  
GUILLERMO: What cigars? 
JERRY: Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans. 
GUILLERMO:  We are the Cubans.  Jerry stares, stunned.     
KRAMER: Yeah, hello, Jerry's place.   
JERRY:  They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?! 
KRAMER: I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant? 
JERRY: Cigars! 
KRAMER: Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got these guys. 
JERRY:  You're making your own cigars now? 
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. I got investors all lined up.  
JERRY:  Hold on a second.  Hiya dad.   
MORTY:  Who are they? 
JERRY: They're Cuban cigar rollers. 
MORTY:  Don't tell your mother.  
JERRY: What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce? 
KRAMER: Hot and spicy. 
JERRY:  You're not wearing a shirt, are you? 
KRAMER: Yes I am. 
JERRY: What colour is it?   
KRAMER: Damn!   
GEORGE: You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't have to take me out to dinner. 
DANIELLE: I wanted to give it to you in person.  
DANIELLE:  You know, I don't have to be up in the morning, and I know a great breakfast place, right around the corner.  
GEORGE: Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast? 
DANIELLE:  Why don't you come in? We'll take about it. 
GEORGE:  I really should get going. Y'know, I..I wanna be home in case Neil calls. 
DANIELLE: Well, goodnight.  
GEORGE:  I'll see you.  
WAITRESS: Rough night? 
ELAINE: Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who I don't even like, they won't talk to me.  All because I don't like that stupid English Patient movie. 
WAITRESS: Really? I thought it was pretty good. 
ELAINE: Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it?  Those sex scenes! I mean, please! Gimme something I can use! 
WAITRESS:  Well, I liked it.  
ELAINE:  Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello?  You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work!     
JERRY: This is quite a condo. 
MORTY: The Mandelbaums own the Magic Pan restaurants. 
JERRY: The crepe place? 
MORTY: Yeah. This is all big crepe money. 
JERRY:  There's crepe money?  
IZZY: What are you doing here? 
JERRY:  Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.   
IZZY: What the hell is that? 
JERRY: What? 
IZZY: That shirt. You think that you are the number one dad? 
MORTY: This was a gift from my son.  
IZZY: Oh, I see how it works now.  
JERRY: Mr Mandelbaum, please. 
IZZY: It's go time.  
IZZY:  Ahh. My back. I can't move.  
MORTY: Call an ambulance. 
JERRY: I think I saw one a coupla doors down.  
JERRY:  So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?!  
GEORGE:  Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he could get a girl like Danielle. 
JERRY:  George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out-Neiled him. 
GEORGE:  So, I'm Neil? How did I do that? 
JERRY: I don't know, but you better keep it up. 
GEORGE: I'm gonna go meet Danielle.  There's a new Neil in town!  Hahaha!  
JERRY:  I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles.  Hello.  In Florida, Helen and Morty each have a handset. Morty is still wearing the '#1 DAD' shirt. 
MORTY: Hey Jerry. Number One here. Did you go see Izzy at the back specialist? 
JERRY: I will, I just walked in the door. 
HELEN: You have to go see him. 
JERRY: Ma. 
MORTY: Helen, will you stop bothering him. 
HELEN: Jerry, that shirt is gone right to his head. 
MORTY: Number One, signing off.  
KRAMER: Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station.  What's going on!? 
JERRY: What? 
KRAMER:  They're not real Cubans. They're Dominicans. 
JERRY: So? 
KRAMER: So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off. 
JERRY: What's the difference? 
KRAMER: Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like it. 
JERRY:  We're talking about people, right? 
KRAMER: Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These guys don't have it. 
JERRY: I thought they smelled pretty nice. 
KRAMER: Jerry, your palate's unrefined. 
JERRY: Is not. 
KRAMER: Is too. 
JERRY: Is not. 
KRAMER: Is too. 
JERRY: I'm not having this conversation. 
KRAMER: Are too. 
JERRY: Am not. 
KRAMER: Are too. 
JERRY: Am not. 
KRAMER: Are too.     
PETERMAN: Another productive meeting. By the way, I saw that English Patient film last night. It was extraordinary. 
DUGAN:  Oh yes. It was so romantic. It ravished me.  Dugan walks away. 
PETERMAN: Elaine, what'd you think? 
ELAINE:  Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't tell you whether I liked it, or whether it really sucked. 
PETERMAN:  You haven't seen it? 
ELAINE:  No. 
PETERMAN: That's it! Drop everything. We're going right now.   
JERRY: Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best. So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try and find my number.  Jerry turns to walk out. 
IZZY: Uh, oh, wait.  
IZZY: How 'bout that, huh? The World's Greatest Dad. My son made it for me. 
JERRY:  That's very nice. 
IZZY: The best in the world.  Which means I'm better than just number one. 
JERRY: Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.  Behind Jerry, an elderly bald guy leans round the doorframe and raps on the door, attracting Izzy's attention. 
IZZY: Hi, son.  IZZY JR.: Hi daddy. 
JERRY:  This is your son? 
IZZY: I got married in high school.  
IZZY JR.:  Hey, who are you? 
IZZY: This is Seinfeld's kid.  
IZZY JR.: Oh, you think you're tough, picking on an old man?  Maybe you'd like to try taking on somebody your own age. 
JERRY:  You got any kids?  
IZZY JR.: Oh, you think you're better than me?  Go ahead, pick out anything in the room here. I'll lift it up over my head. 
JERRY:  Look, no-one is lifting anything. 
IZZY:  The television. 
JERRY:  Oh no.  Izzy Jr walks over to the TV, which sits on top of a cabinet.  
IZZY JR.: This one's for you, Pop. It's go time.  
IZZY JR.:  Ohh! My back! 
IZZY:  Call an ambulance. 
JERRY:  We're already in a hospital.     
HAFFLER: Awright, partner. Let's get down to business. 
KRAMER:  Okay, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans.  
KRAMER: They're right out here.  
KRAMER: Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans.  
HAFFLER: You wouldn't be trying to sell old Earl Haffler Dominicans in a Cuban wrapper now, would you? 
KRAMER:  Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh. 
HAFFLER:  We're talking about people, right? 
KRAMER:  I think so. 
HAFFLER: I thought he quit smoking cigars. 
KRAMER: Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother...  ...Dennis. 
HAFFLER:  Dennis Castro? 
KRAMER: Uh, Dwayne. 
HAFFLER: Get the hell outta my office. 
KRAMER:  What!?     Danielle and George walk over to, and sit in, a booth. 
DANIELLE: You know, Neil called me today. 
GEORGE:  Really? 
DANIELLE: Yeah. He's pretty upset that I broke up with him to go out with you. 
GEORGE:  Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil. 
DANIELLE: He wants to get together tomorrow night and have coffee. 
GEORGE:  Coffee?  I can beat that. Move in with me. 
DANIELLE:  What? 
GEORGE:  Beats the hell out of coffee.  
PETERMAN:  And I thought I knew what love was.  
ELAINE:  Yuh.      
JERRY:  You asked her to move in with you? 
GEORGE: I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil. 
JERRY:  What if it's Neil Armstrong?  
GEORGE:  Then I'm going to Mars! 
JERRY: What if it's Neil Diamond? 
GEORGE:  Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up! 
JERRY: Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital. 
GEORGE: What, to see the old guy? 
JERRY: No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too. 
GEORGE: How old's the son? 
JERRY: I think he's the same age as the father. 
GEORGE: What is with this family? 
JERRY: I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench press the casket.  
KRAMER:  Hey, Jerry.  
KRAMER:  Datiditadit. 
JERRY: You're cold? 
KRAMER: No.   Ditadidatidat. 
JERRY: Something wrong with your chest? 
KRAMER:  Dijadidatjd. There. 
JERRY:  Where? 
KRAMER:  No, no. Don't look. Don't look.  
KRAMER: Over there. The Dominicans. 
JERRY: Aren't they supposed to be rolling cigars? 
KRAMER: Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them to do. 
GEORGE: So? 
KRAMER: So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing.  
JERRY: Boy, they seem pretty angry about something. 
KRAMER:  Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work, and the people get restless, who do you think they come after?  El Presidente!  
JERRY: I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.  
IZZY JR.: I bet you pulled that trick on my daddy, in Florida. 
JERRY: He couldn't handle the weight. 
IZZY:  Oh, so now you think you're better than me?  
IZZY JR.:  You think you're better than him?! 
JERRY:  Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me. 
IZZY: Okay.  
IZZY SR.: My boys. 
IZZY: My dad.  
IZZY JR.: My grandpa. 
JERRY:  Oh, come on!  
IZZY SR.:  What happened to him? 
JERRY: He was trying to lift the TV.  
IZZY SR.:  That TV?  Izzy Sr. strides purposefully toward the TV. 
JERRY:  Oh no.  It's go time.  Off-screen there is a familiar crunching sound  
IZZY IZZY SR.. :  Oohh!     
IZZY SR.: Why didn't anybody tell me? It was bolted down! 
IZZY: I still thought you could do it.  
IZZY JR.: Me too.  
IZZY/IZZY JR/IZZY IZZY SR.:  Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum... 
JERRY: Fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go. 
IZZY: Oh yeah, that's right. Go. Put us all in the hospital. And you've ruined our business with all your macho head games. 
JERRY:  I didn't ruin your business. 
IZZY: Yes, you did. There's nobody there now at the Magic Pan to roll the crepes. We gotta close it up. 
JERRY:  Don't you hire people to do that? 
IZZY: Each crepe has to be hand-rolled by a Mandelbaum. That's what puts the magic in Magic Pan! 
JERRY:  So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em? 
IZZY: Yeah. 
JERRY:  I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.  
IZZY SR.:  Hey, I can't see the TV.  
JERRY: Here.   
IZZY: You think you're better than us,don't you?! Huh!?     
PETERMAN: Elaine, I hope you're watching the clothes, because I can't take my eyes off the passion. 
ELAINE:  Oh. No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long.  Quit telling your stupid story, about the stupid desert, and just die already!  Die!!  
PETERMAN:  Elaine. You don't like the movie? 
ELAINE:  I hate it!! 
CROWD: Shh! 
ELAINE:  Oh, go to hell!! 
PETERMAN:  Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? You're fired. 
ELAINE:  Great. I'll wait for you outside.   
JERRY: He was gonna fire you? 
ELAINE: The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert. 
JERRY: Tunisia? 
ELAINE: That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me. 
JERRY: Well, that doesn't sound so bad. 
ELAINE: I have to live in a cave. 
JERRY:  Oh.   Kramer comes over to the booth. 
KRAMER: These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that. It's like they're rolling a double corona.  
KRAMER:  Just a cigar made outta bisquik, huh, Guillermo?  
DANIELLE: I'm very happy with George. I'm sorry Neil, it's over.  
DANIELLE: Come on, let's just eat our crepes.  
CUSTOMER:  Aaghh!! My face!  
DANIELLE:  Neil!  The restaurant is in chaos as yells of pain come from all sides. 
JERRY: Why are the crepes spraying? 
KRAMER:  The Dominicans are rolling them too tight.  Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.   
GEORGE: Danielle. Where's Neil?  Is this him? 
DANIELLE: Yeah, that blueberry crepe burned him pretty badly.   
GEORGE:  Whose cane is this? 
DANIELLE: It's Neil's.   
GEORGE:  A cane. I knew it.  So, we meet at last. I admire your skills, Mr Peanut.  
GEORGE: Well, Danielle,  we should get going. I got a key made for you.  
DANIELLE: George, I can't move in with you. 
GEORGE:  What? 
DANIELLE: I'm sorry, but I'm taking Neil to a clinic in England. 
GEORGE:  N..no, no. You can't leave me.  Marry me! I'll burn myself. I'll burn my parents! 
DANIELLE: Sorry George.   
NEIL:  George.  
NEIL:  I win.  
TAN: Ladies and gentlemen. In just one moment, we'll be showing our feature presentation... 
ELAINE:  No, no, no, no, no. 
TAN: ...the comedy hit, Sack Lunch, starring Dabney Coleman. 
ELAINE:  Ah, right! Aw, this is shaping up.  
ELAINE: Oh, sure.  
ELAINE:  Ooh.  T 
GUILLERMO: Ladies and gentlemen. Because we have been exploited by your Magic Pan crepe restaurants...  
GUILLERMO: ...we are hijacking this plane to Cuba!   
GUILLERMO: Everyone stay in your seats. And shut that movie off! 
ELAINE:  Aww, nuts!
