JERRY:  Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit.. 
KRAMER:  Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago! 
JERRY:  I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy. 
KRAMER:  Hey! Mike! 
MIKE:   Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?! 
JERRY:  Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that.. 
MIKE:  Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!

MIKE:   Either of you guys wanna place a bet: I'm your guy. 
KRAMER:   Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease. 
JERRY:  I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years.

PEGGY:  Oh, it was no problem. 
ELAINE:   Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.  
PEGGY:   Thanks, Susie.             
ELAINE:  You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie." 
JERRY:  I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe. 
ELAINE:  What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island? 
JERRY:  Who are you describing? 
ELAINE:  Someone I know. 
JERRY:  Named Sharon? 
ELAINE:  I'd rather not say.

ELAINE:   Lithe! 
JERRY:  Oh, lithe!

GEORGE:  An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance! 
ELAINE:  Backless? Ya gonna back her in? 
GEORGE:  Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls. 
ELAINE:  She's not gonna twirl-- 
GEORGE:  She'll Twirl.          
GEORGE:  That is what Mr. Steinbrenner wants. He wants, everyone, ta, twirl around.  
ALLISON:   All right.

ALLISON:   Yeah, uh--here.  
GEORGE:  Oh! Great!  
ALLISON:  Uh. Say, George--

ALLISON:   George. We need to talk. 
GEORGE:  What?  
ALLISON:  I really, think we need to talk. 
GEORGE:   Uh-oh.         
JERRY:  She wants to talk. 
GEORGE:  She doesn't Want to talk, she needs to talk. 
JERRY:  Nobody needs to talk. 
GEORGE:  Who would Want to.  She tried to end it with me, Jerry. 
JERRY:  What'd ya do? 
GEORGE:  I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back. 
JERRY:   All night?! 
GEORGE:  Yeah, I slept at my parents' house. 
JERRY:  And she wants to break up with you.. 
GEORGE:  Ha!  Can you believe it?  I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro. 
JERRY:  Uh-oh. "Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's." 
GEORGE:  So? What'm I gonna do? 
JERRY:  You really like this girl. 
GEORGE:  No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance! 
JERRY:  You've made some Fine Exits. 
GEORGE:   All right.. 
JERRY:  So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her. 
GEORGE:   Why not.   If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll. 
KRAMER:   Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison-- 
GEORGE:  Yeah, yeah, right here.  
KRAMER:  All right! Yeah.. Courtside.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away.. 
GEORGE:   Ha.. She'll have to find me first.  
KRAMER:  {All right.}  Ah? Oh, by the way: you owe Mike a hundred dollars. 
JERRY:  What for? 
KRAMER:  Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one.  Oo-oo! That's some sweet action! 
JERRY:  But I don't want any "sweet action." 
KRAMER:  Well, I couldn't do it: I got a gamblin' problem. 
JERRY:  So you put down my money?! 
KRAMER:   You don't have a problem. 
JERRY:  Not with that, no..         
PEGGY:  Susie.  Susie! 
ELAINE:   Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--  
PEGGY:  Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes? 
ELAINE:  Yeah. See that--  
PEGGY:   You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.  She practically ran the company into the gro-ound. 
ELAINE:  Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..  
PEGGY:  I heard she was a disaster, Suze-- 
ELAINE:   Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-zie. My name, is Su-zie!           
GEORGE:   "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up  the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome."    
JERRY:  George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison. 
GEORGE:   Hey. 
JERRY:  So, coffee shop? 
GEORGE:  No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure.   Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye.  
GEORGE:   "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up  the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome."     
ALLISON:   George? Are you there?   I hate that stupid message.   I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you.    
GEORGE:   Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home.. I probably should 'ave tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear  from ya, really looking forward to the ball..  Ha ha!      
ELAINE:  Can you believe this woman? 
JERRY:   The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face! 
ELAINE:  No. "Suze!" I mean, "Suzie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze. 
JERRY:  No. No Suze. 
ELAINE:   I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Backseat Bimbo?! 
JERRY:  Who are you describin'? 
ELAINE:  Someone I know! 
JERRY:  Named Suze? 
ELAINE:  No, still Sharon! 
KRAMER:   Hey.  
JERRY:  Hey, I thought you went to the game. 
KRAMER:  No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players.  
JERRY:  Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?! 
KRAMER:   W--Reggie Miller. 
ELAINE:  Cheryl Miller's brother? 
KRAMER:  Yeah.  
JERRY:  Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened! 
KRAMER:   Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an'  he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved.  
ELAINE:   --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!-- 
JERRY:  Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?! 
KRAMER:   Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hotdog at Reggie Miller. "Involved."  An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game. 
ELAINE:  So that's it? 
KRAMER:  Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club.  
JERRY:  Can you believe that? 
ELAINE:  I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball. 
KRAMER:   The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three! 
JERRY:  What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout! 
KRAMER:  No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it  riiiide! 
JERRY:  On what?! 
KRAMER:   Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on  the ponies.  
JERRY:  Yeah, all right. 
KRAMER:   Ssssh--ah! They just closed! 
JERRY:   Oh. Too Bad.         
ELAINE:  Mr. Peterman? You wanted to see me?  
PETERMAN:  Apparently Peggy--down in Design?--got into a liiiittle bit of a Tiff yesterday with somebody named, "Susie"? 
ELAINE:  Su-sie?  
PETERMAN:  Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk.  Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker. 
ELAINE:   It's Susie.  
PETERMAN:  Nevertheless, Elaine. The House, of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and, Susie  right here, in my office. 
ELAINE:   Ah, all o'--all of us?      
KRAMER:  Allison. Hi. Uh--listen: I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause  the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.  
ALLISON:  Kramer? Have you seen George, around? I can't get a hold of him. 
KRAMER:  Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, he--uh--visits the guy across the hall from me like every ten minutes.  
ALLISON:  Oh yeah?            
JERRY:   Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home. 
MIKE:   Hey. Jerry. 
JERRY:  Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks? 
MIKE:   Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you. 
JERRY:  Why not? 
MIKE:  'Cause I don't have the money.. 
JERRY:  Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"? 
MIKE:  Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please! 
JERRY:  You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one. 
MIKE:  I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.   
JERRY:   Something wrong with this trunk. 
MIKE:  Oh. Let me see.          
GEORGE:  So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner?   An' why Pomodoro?   
KRAMER:   Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you. 
GEORGE:   Uh-oh. 
KRAMER:  We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break. 
GEORGE:  Can't we discuss this? 
KRAMER:   We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship! 
GEORGE:   I didn't even know you wanted to get serious! 
KRAMER:   So what am I in this for?  You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time.  
GEORGE:   Are you? 
KRAMER:  Wha--me? No! No. But she is. 
GEORGE:  I, I can't believe this is happening! 
KRAMER:  George, we're sorry.   We're through.. 
GEORGE:  Krama. Please. 
KRAMER:   Waaa-aa--aa! I'm sorry--          
ELAINE:   Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with.   
PETERMAN:  Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short. 
ELAINE:  Oh.  No, we're not--  
PEGGY:  Susie has been very rude to me.  
PETERMAN:  Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie. 
ELAINE:  Look.   We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or..   name names!   Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--  
PETERMAN:  Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her.  
ELAINE:  Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.  
PETERMAN:  Who. 
ELAINE:   Her?  
PETERMAN:  Where is she?! 
ELAINE:  Ah--this is part of the problem!  
PEGGY:  Iiii thought I was, part of this problem. 
ELAINE:   You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that  requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!  
PETERMAN:  Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch. 
ELAINE:   What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go.   
PETERMAN:  She is The Best.  What was your name again.         
KRAMER:  Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you. 
JERRY:  Well why doesn't he just come in? 
KRAMER:  Because he's scared, Jerry. 
JERRY:  Why is he scared. 
KRAMER:   Come on in.  Did you do this?  
JERRY:  Yeah, but-- 
KRAMER:  Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs. 
JERRY:  It was an accident. 
KRAMER:  Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up? 
MIKE:   I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it! 
JERRY:   I don't want it that way. 
KRAMER:  Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt. 
JERRY:   Fine.. 
MIKE:  Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!   
KRAMER:  See that was nice, Jerry.  Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk. 
JERRY:  Ah, it's just a car.   
GEORGE:  Hi. 
KRAMER:   Hi.

GEORGE:   Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime. 
KRAMER:  George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over.  
GEORGE:   What do you think, Jerry. 
JERRY:   I don't know, I just see you guys together.            
MIKE:  Thumbs!   
MIKE:   Oh!  Help!  Somebody, help! Help!      
JERRY:  So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that! 
ELAINE:  Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity. 
JERRY:  Yeah, I know how you feel.   
ELAINE:  Do you hear something? 
JERRY:  What?   
JERRY:  Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling. 
ELAINE:  Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now! 
JERRY:  Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her. 
ELAINE:  What? 
JERRY:   Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear. 
ELAINE:  I kinda like her. 
JERRY:  She's Gooone. 
ELAINE:  Jerry-- 
JERRY:   Gone!    That bumper sticker.   
MIKE:   Oh God, I'm in trouble..

KRAMER:   Uh--George, uh--uh--it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you..

KRAMER:  All right, all right, I'll see ya later.  
GEORGE:   Woooo!      
ELAINE:   Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment. 
PETERMAN:  Mmmmm--nah. 
ELAINE:  All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie..   she took her own Life..           
KRAMER:   We're takin' George back--  
ALLISON:  What?! 
KRAMER:  He's gonna make us very happy.        
ELAINE:   Look at this turnout. 
JERRY:   Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people.. 
ELAINE:   Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.    
PEGGY:   Oh my god!   Susie? 
ELAINE:   Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.  
PEGGY:  But I've been calling you Susie. 
ELAINE:  Oh! Hadn't noticed!  Excuse me.   
PEGGY:  I guess I never met Susie. 
JERRY:   Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while.   Her too.   
ELAINE:  What can you say about a girl like Susie?          
KRAMER:  Hey. 
GEORGE:  Where's uh, where's Allison.. 
KRAMER:  Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come. 
GEORGE:  But you took me back. 
KRAMER:  Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut.  How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years.  All right, eh.  
GEORGE:  Where are you goin'.. 
KRAMER:  The Ball, silly. 
GEORGE:   No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there. 
KRAMER:  George. I thought you were gonna Change.

KRAMER:   Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..   
GEORGE:  All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!

ELAINE:  Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman.   
PETERMAN:   Ahhh.  I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the  catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation.  And it was Pretty Good. 
JERRY:   Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em.    
PETERMAN:  But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help.   An' nowww.. Susie is gone. 
MIKE:   Hold on! Hol--on!  Susie didn't commit suicide!   She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!   
JERRY:   Not only that, I broke his thumbs.               
PETERMAN:  Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to  be involved.
