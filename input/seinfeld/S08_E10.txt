GEORGE: Jerry!  Georgie's moving out! 
JERRY:  Get out! 
GEORGE: I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it. 
JERRY:  Is it better than mine? 
GEORGE:  Oh yeah. 
JERRY: So, it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya? 
GEORGE: You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call.  
JERRY: She's out. 
GEORGE:  Oh right, the blind date. 
JERRY: Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers. 
GEORGE: Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes. 
JERRY: I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage. 
GEORGE:  Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet.  
JERRY:  Oh, this is really annoying. 
GEORGE:  It's working already!        
JERRY:  What is with that?! 
KRAMER: Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air.  
JERRY:  Where is your key? 
KRAMER: Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it. 
JERRY: You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you. 
KRAMER: Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman.    
JERRY:  Mail bags? He's storing mail in here? 
KRAMER:  Evidently.       
RICARDI: Excuse me, George? 
GEORGE:  Yeah, uh, no menus.  
RICARDI:  No, I'm Mrs. Ricardi - president of the tenant's association. 
GEORGE: Oh, right!  Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me!  Come on!  
RICARDI: No, no..  Uh, George, unfortunately, Clarance Eldridge in 8C has decided that he wants the apartment. 
GEORGE:  Yeah, but you - you promised it to me. 
RICARDI: Yes, but, you see - Mister Eldridge is an Andrea Doria survivor. And, in light of the terrible suffering that he's already been through, we've decided to  give it to him. 
GEORGE:  Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire.  
RICARDI:  Shipwreck. 
GEORGE: I remember..        
ELAINE: Where is this guy?!  I hate this!  I shoulda brought something to read..  "Cancer in labratory animals"..  huh.   
WAITER: Excuse me, Elaine Benes? 
ELAINE: Yeah? 
WAITER: An Alan Mercer called for you. He said he's sorry, but he won't be able to make it tonight.  He's been stabbed. 
ELAINE:  Stabbed?! 
WAITER: More bread?     
JERRY:  You ate more bread? 
ELAINE: That is not the point! The guy was stabbed! 
JERRY: Did you find out who stabbed him? 
ELAINE: Yeah,  It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend. 
JERRY:  Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore. 
ELAINE: Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion.  I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment. 
JERRY:  Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.   
KRAMER:  Hey. How's everybody?   JERRY AND ELAINE: Hey. 
KRAMER: Ehh..  No expiration date on this..  
JERRY: There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor. 
KRAMER:  Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line..  Plus, the botched my vasectimy. 
JERRY:  The botched it? 
KRAMER:  I'm even more potent now!   
GEORGE: Hey. 
JERRY: Hey. How's the new place?! 
GEORGE: Gone.  The tenant association made me give it  to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor.. 
ELAINE: Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about? 
JERRY:  Edmund Fitzgerald. 
ELIANE: I love Edmund Fitzgerald's voice. 
JERRY:  No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship. 
GEORGE:  You could fit 15 people in that bathroom.. 
ELAINE: I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat. 
JERRY:  Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens. 
KRAMER:  The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket.    
GEORGE: How do you know? 
KRAMER: it's in my book - "Astonishing Tales of the Sea" 51 people died. 
GEORGE: 51 people?! 
KRAMER: That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand! 
KRAMER: There were 1,650 survivors. 
GEORGE: That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book?  
KRAMER: Oh yeah. I also got "Astounding Bear Attacks"   
JERRY: Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there? 
KRAMER: Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it.          
JERRY: Newman? 
NEWMAN:  I guess. 
JERRY: Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit. 
NEWMAN: Sometimes we don't get what we want. 
JERRY:  What are you talking about? 
NEWMAN: I didn't get my transfer. 
JERRY: "Transfer"? 
NEWMAN: To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm  hanging it up. 
JERRY: You quit the post office? 
NEWMAN: Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail. 
JERRY: Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal. 
NEWMAN: And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall. 
JERRY:  Well, a law's a law.        
KRAMER: Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh? 
MAN: What cough?         
ELAINE: I love shrimp!  I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me,  and I will eat it until my stomach pops!  Oh..  
ALAN: No, it's okay. I'm.. still just a little bit jumpy. 
ELAINE:  Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing? 
ALAN: Just.. one of those things, you know. 
ELAINE: What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..? 
ALAN: I don't know. Could be.   
CAROL: Alan?! 
ALAN: Carol?   
ELAINE:  Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?! 
ALAN:  No, that was a different girl.     
JERRY: There was another crazed ex-girlfriend? 
ELAINE: Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper. 
JERRY: Mmm.. Bad how? 
ELAINE:  Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them. 
JERRY:  I follow. So what are you gonna do? 
ELAINE: Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship. 
JERRY:  What's more important?         
KRAMER:  Hey. 
GEORGE: What's with the dog? 
KRAMER:  Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him.  
GEORGE: Oh..   
KRAMER:  Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out. 
GEORGE: A vet? 
KRAMER: Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a  lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog  - all on the same day. 
GEORGE: So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take dog medicine? 
KRAMER:  You bet we are! Huh, Smuckers?  I'll see ya.       
GEORGE: Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria. 
ELDRIDGE: Yes, it was a terrifying ordeal. 
GEORGE: I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships.  The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence?  
ELDRIDGE:  We had to abandon ship. 
GEORGE: Well, all vacations have to end eventually. 
ELDRIDGE: The boat sank. 
GEORGE:  According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence.  So,  uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty? 
ELDRIDGE: Is that what this is all about?! I don't think I like you.  
GEORGE:  It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha!       
VET: What are the symptoms? 
KRAMER: Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice.  I mean, uh.. dog food.. juice.  What's  worse - he has a nagging cough.  Yeah, that's it. That's it. 
VET: Yeah, well, uh - we've been seeing a lot of this lately. Been drinking from the toilet? 
KRAMER:  What? No. That's disgusting..     
ALAN: So that's it? We're, uh, we're breakin' up? 
ELAINE:  What? Break-up? We went out on one date. 
ALAN:  Ok, yeah, sure, fine, right. Whatever you say. 
ELAINE:  Alright, good. Good. 
ALAN: Ok, then, well, So.. see ya around.. big head.  
ELAINE: Pardon? 
ALAN: You got a big head. It's too big for your body.  
ELAINE:  That's it?!  That's the best you got?!      
GEORGE: So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've  been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday! 
JERRY: You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the "Astonishing Tales of Costanza". 
GEORGE:  I should! 
JERRY: I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled. 
GEORGE: I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet! 
JERRY: You're the man!   
NEWMAN: Jerry! 
JERRY: I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment.  So, you want a protein shake, or something? 
GEORGE: Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go.  
JERRY:  Hello.. Newman. 
NEWMAN:  I need that mail, where is it?! 
JERRY: What's the difference? 
NEWMAN: The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail! 
JERRY: Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it. 
NEWMAN: Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii!  I'll be  stuck in this apartment building forever!  The dream is dead. 
JERRY: You're giving up that easy? 
NEWMAN: I usually do.  See ya. 
JERRY:  No, wait a minute, Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too! 
NEWMAN:  What are you proposing? 
JERRY:  Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me! 
NEWMAN: An alliance? 
JERRY:  An alliance.  Now get the hell outta here.        
ELAINE: Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with the mail? 
JERRY:  Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to  play with my toys. 
ELAINE: Well, anyway, get this: I spoke to Alan. You know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me "big head". 
JERRY: "Big head"  That's almost a compliment. 
ELAINE:  It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.   
JERRY: Hello? 
GEORGE:  Hey. 
JERRY: Hey, George. 
GEORGE: Yeah, listen, I can't make it later. 
JERRY: You can't make it? 
GEORGE: Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya. 
JERRY: Alright.  
ELAINE: Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop? 
JERRY:  Doesn't look like it's gonna happen. 
ELAINE:  Alright, well, I'll see ya.  
JERRY: Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that? 
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah.  I got some pilss. They taste terrible. 
JERRY:  Just swallow 'em. 
KRAMER:  No, my throat's too tender. 
JERRY: Alright, sit down, sit down.  
KRAMER: I don't want to!   
JERRY: C'mon. Just sit down! 
KRAMER:  Jerry! What?! 
JERRY: Sit down! Sit down! 
KRAMER:  Hey! 
JERRY: Lean your head back. Open your mouth!  Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!   
JERRY:  What kind of pills are these, anyways?! "For Smuckers"? "May cause panting and loss of fur"?  These are dog  pills! 
KRAMER: Whe have the same symptoms. 
JERRY: But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor. 
KRAMER: No, no. No doctors. 
JERRY: Alright..  
KRAMER: Where are you going? 
JERRY: I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go? 
KRAMER: I don't know.. 
JERRY:  C'mon, you wanna go for a ride?  Huh? C'mon! C'mon!         
DRIVER: Lady, could you move your head a little bit? 
ELAINE: What? 
DRIVER: Your head. I can't see out the back.  Little more..  ..Little more.  Thank you.       
KRAMER: I don't see any tissues back her..  Wait a minute!..  This isn't the  way to the park!  Where are we going?.. I recognize this block!  You're taking me to the doctor!       
GEORGE: So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly.. 
ESTELLE: I feel a draft.  Let's change tables. 
FRANK: Get outta here! We have a booth. 
ESTELLE: Frank, I'm cold! 
FRANK: Order a hot dish. 
ESTELLE: Why can't we sit over there?  
FRANK:  That's not a booth! 
ESTELLE:  So, who says we have to sit in a booth?! 
FRANK:  I didn't take the subway all the way to New York to sit at a table like that!  
ESTELLE:  Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant!   
GEORGE:  Mom.. dad. 
FRANK: Now, George, what do you want to know about your childhood? 
GEORGE:  Actually, I think I'm pretty clear on it. 
FRANK:  Where's that breeze coming from?       
JERRY: Kramer, outta the car. Out, now! 
KRAMER: No, Jerry! 
JERRY: Alright, that's it..  
KRAMER: No! Don't!   
JERRY: Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer!       
ELDRIDGE: Just then, a rescue ship emerged from the fog and saved us. It was..  It was the  sweetest sight my eyes ever saw. 
RICARDI:  Thank you Mr. Eldridge. The tenant board will now hear Mr. Costanza's testimony.         
JERRY: Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered?  What happened? 
NEWMAN: Kramer bit me! 
JERRY: Bit you?! 
NEWMAN: We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route -  and they're awarding the transfer in two days! 
JERRY:  Well, what if I deliver it? 
NEWMAN: You?!  You can't deliver mail! 
JERRY: Well, why not? 
NEWMAN:  I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes.. 
JERRY: What am I gonna wear? 
NEWMAN: I could give you my uniform from my rookie year. 
JERRY:  I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!   
JERRY:  There you go. Merry Chirstmas! 
OWNER: Mail on Sunday? 
JERRY:  Oops.        
GEORGE: I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear,  where I remained..  She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a  Nazi..  The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage..  Her parents were looking at me.. So, there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole..  In closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short,  stocky, slow witted bald man.  Thank you.  Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out.  Thanks again.        
JERRY: Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, "Photographs - Do not bend". 
NEWMAN: "Do not bend".  Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine.  Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand..  very well.  
JERRY: What? 
NEWMAN: That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route! 
JERRY: How did they know?! 
NEWMAN:  Too many people go their mail! Close to 80 barrier! It's like the 3-minute mile! 
JERRY:  I tried my best! 
NEWMAN: Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform.  
JERRY: You know, this is your coat. 
NEWMAN:  Damn!        MAN 2: He flew right into your head. Like he couldn't avoid it. 
ELAINE:  Really?  MAN 2: Never seen that before. Bird into a woman's head..       
GEORGE: It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on. 
JERRY: Boy, he didn't know what he was up against.  So, when do you move into the apartment? 
GEORGE: They're making their decision today.   
JERRY: What's the matter with you? 
ELAINE: Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head.  
JERRY: What giant freak-head? 
ELAINE:  The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple! 
JERRY: So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands! 
ELAINE:  What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or  jam a fork into his forehead. 
JERRY:  Either way. 
ELAINE:  Alright.     
ALAN: I want to apologize for.. 
ELAINE:  Oh, please. 
ALAN: So you have a big head. 
ELAINE:  So what? 
ALAN: It goes well with that bump in your nose. 
ELAINE:  What?!   
WOMAN: Please! Get help! There's a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police "The Old Mill Restaurant". Hurry!   
COP: Boy, that's some cough you got there.    COP 2: No, I think he's trying to tell us something. What is it?  Trouble?! Trouble? Where? Where's  trouble?  Trouble at the Old Mill?! Oh my god! Good boy, good boy! Lead the way! Come on.         
GEORGE: Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there? 
ALAN: I'm moving in. Alan Mercer. New neighbor.  
GEORGE: What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?! 
ALAN: Yeah. 
GEORGE: Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh..  
ALAN: Oh, fork in the forehead. 
GEORGE: That's why they gave you the apartment? 
ALAN: No, I just gave the super 50 bucks. 
GEORGE: Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery! 
ALAN: Tough luck, chinless.
