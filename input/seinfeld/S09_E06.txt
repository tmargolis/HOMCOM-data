JERRY: Why were you making gravel? 
KRAMER: Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.  Hey, those look familiar. 
JERRY: Of course. It's garbage. 
KRAMER: No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs. Jerry, this is the set from the old Merv Griffin  Show! They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian! 
JERRY: Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian. 
KRAMER: Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gold is sitting on you and the next thing -  you're yesterday's trash. 
JERRY: Come on, Kramer, get out of there. 
KRAMER: No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this in.  Oh, Jerry look ... Merv Griffin's cigar. 
JERRY:       
GEORGE: You know I uh, spilled a yohgurt smoothie in here two days ago. Can't smell anything, can  y'a? 
MIRANDA: Banana? 
GEORGE: Right. 
MIRANDA: George watch out for those pigeons. 
GEORGE: Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?   
MIRANDA: Oh my God. Oh. 
GEORGE: So uh where are we eating?      
JERRY: And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate. 
CELIA: You're making this up. There was never a Joseph Garnish.       
JERRY: Wow! 
CELIA: Oh yeah the toys. 
JERRY: Where did you get all these? 
CELIA: My dad was a collector. I inherited them after he died from a long and painful bout ... 
JERRY: Super bowl! Hey, an original G. I. Joe. With a full frogman suit. 
CELIA: Jerry, what are you doing? 
JERRY: I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink. 
CELIA: No Jerry. They're priceless. They've never been played with. 
JERRY: I just want to touch them a little. 
CELIA: I said no. Now come here.            
LOU: Hi I'm Lou Filerman. I'm new here. 
ELAINE: Hey Walter what is the deal with that guy? 
WALTER: Oh he's Lou Filerman. He's new here. Hey your coffee stain looks like Fidel Castro. 
ELAINE: You've been an enormous help.   
JERRY: You ran over some pigeons? How many? 
GEORGE: What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but it's not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons? 
JERRY: Of course. We have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation. 
GEORGE: Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this. 
JERRY: So Maranda's cooled on y'a? 
GEORGE: I'm getting nothing. 
JERRY: Yeah, me neither. 
GEORGE: Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together? 
JERRY: Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!   
GEORGE: I don't understand women. 
JERRY: Here comes one. 
ELAINE: Hey. What's going on? 
GEORGE: Hey  Art Garfunkle? 
ELAINE: No, Castro. 
GEORGE: Right. 
ELAINE: All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he just comes out of nowhere and he's right  next to you! 
JERRY: So he just sidles up? 
ELAINE: That's right! He's a real sidler. 
JERRY: Maybe you didn't see him. 
ELAINE: You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making a cup of soup  singing that song from "The Lion King". 
JERRY: Hakuna Matata? 
ELAINE: I thought I was alone. 
JERRY: That doesn't make it right.      
JERRY: See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup ... 
ELAINE: Would you just let it go? 
KRAMER: Hey, Jerry! Come in here a sec! Hey! 
JERRY: Oh my God! 
KRAMER: It's the Merv Griffin set 
JERRY: How did you get this in here? 
KRAMER: Oh, you just bring it in sideways and hook it. 
JERRY: So where are you gonna sleep? 
KRAMER: Yeah ... backstage. 
ELAINE: Phew! This chair smells like garbage. 
KRAMER: Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV  yeah, you can take Mannix for example.   
JERRY: I'm gonna get that. 
KRAMER: All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime Well, Elaine Benes!  Well, it's great to have you!  Why, is it possible that you are even more  beautiful than the last time I saw you? 
ELAINE:      
GEORGE: We had a deal!         
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted. 
PETERMAN: One moment. I'm reading the most fascinating article on the most fascinating people of the  year. Annnnnd done. Oh, yes. I'm sorry I needed this so quickly. It must have been an  awful lot of work. Thank you very much, you two. 
ELAINE: What?           
JERRY: So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys. 
KRAMER: That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys growing up. 
JERRY: Yeah, that was me. 
KRAMER: Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had. 
JERRY: An Army Pete. 
KRAMER: Right. 
JERRY: He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split. 
KRAMER: And we all know how painful that can be.   
ELAINE: Jerry 
KRAMER: Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come on sit down. Yes. 
ELAINE: Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping my hide. 
KRAMER: Excuse me yeah. We're talking ... this way. 
ELAINE: Well, he's getting credit for work I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job. 
KRAMER: Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what? 
ELAINE: Kramer, what is wrong with you? 
KRAMER: What do you mean? 
ELAINE: Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards  I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste  of his own medicine, so, I'm going to sidle the sidler. 
JERRY: You, sidle? You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale! 
ELAINE: Not with these honeys. ... Wrestling shoes! 
KRAMER: Only in New York. ... ha ha 
GEORGE: Jerry?   
KRAMER: Oh! Well, ladies and gentlemen! It's our good friend, George Costanza! What a surprise!  Yeah, sit, sit, sit.. Weeell! 
GEORGE: Well, it happened again. 
JERRY: What happened? 
KRAMER: tut tut , I'll ask the questions. What happened? 
GEORGE: Well, I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didn't move. 
KRAMER: All right, let's change the subject. Now, uh you and Jerry dated for a while. Tell us ... what  was that like? That was the wrong card. 
GEORGE: I I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It's like the pigeons decided to ignore me! 
JERRY: So they're like everyone else.       
KRAMER:  All right, let's take a short break. .... Okay! We're back!   
GEORGE: Boy that bank clock is eight minutes off. 
MIRANDA: Then why don't you just run IT over too? 
GEORGE: Zing. 
MIRANDA: George, what are you doing? 
GEORGE: Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved  that pigeons life! 
MIRANDA: What pigeon? You drove right onto that squirrel.  
GEORGE: Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!     
CELIA: Jerry! Those hands! They never stop! 
JERRY: I'm sorry. You got any booze? Let's say you and I get ripped! 
CELIA: No thanks. I have a headache. Can you just get me an aspirin? 
JERRY: All right.    
LOU: Here's the new copy you wanted. 
PETERMAN: Ah, yes. Well this certainly looks like a lot of words. In record time. I'm very impressed ...  with both of you. 
ELAINE:  Thank you. ha ha 
PETERMAN: Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. This is incoherent dribble! This is a total redo and I'm  assuming I need it right away. 
ELAINE: Well, I guess we'll just  Hey, just gimme that.   
JERRY:  Mission accomplished! Back to base, Joe.   
MIRANDA: Doctor, is the squirrel going to live? 
DOCTOR: There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to save him but it would be costly,  difficult and we'd have to send away for some special really tiny instruments. 
GEORGE: Well, uh, are there any other options? 
DOCTOR: We could put him to sleep. 
GEORGE: What might that cost? 
DOCTOR: Well, it's by the pound. So ... about 80 cents. 
GEORGE: Well?  I was just - I'm curious, that's all. We, uh. we'd like you to do  everything possible. 
DOCTOR: He, um. he's not going to be the same, you know? 
GEORGE: yeah. yeah. I know.   
GEORGE: So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso. 
KRAMER: El Paso? I spent a month there one night. 
NEWMAN: El Paso! 
JERRY: What's he here for? 
KRAMER: To take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry, what's going on with you? I understand  there's a young lady in your life. mmm 
JERRY: Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night  I finally got to play with them. 
KRAMER: Well. It sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear wedding bells? 
NEWMAN: Are you married right now? 
JERRY: Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and  I guess she passed out! 
KRAMER: What do you mean "wrong kind of medicine"? 
JERRY: She's even got that old Matel football game that we love! 
GEORGE: Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there! 
KRAMER: Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take  advantage of her toys? Let's pause a moment. Jerry, now, what you do with your personal  life is your business, but when you're on my set - you clean it up, mister! 
NEWMAN: I told you he was a risk. 
JERRY: Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years! 
NEWMAN: Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs! 
KRAMER: Smile, everyone! We're back!   
LOU: You wanted to see me, Elaine? 
ELAINE: Yes, Lou. you've got a lot going for you. You're, ... um ... you're spontaneous. You're  symmetrical. You're, uh, ... you're very quick, aren't y'a?. It's just that your... 
LOU: My dead tooth? 
ELAINE: No. Your.  
LOU: My breath? 
ELAINE: Eechh. 
LOU: What can I do? 
ELAINE: Well, you should never ever go anywhere without these.  
LOU: Thanks, Elaine. You're such a super lady!       
GEORGE: More wine and turkey?  
JERRY: So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought:  ... What a coincidence. We're just about to eat. 
CELIA: What is that stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy?  JERRY and GEORGE: Triptaphen. 
JERRY: ... I think. Have some more wine. 
CELIA: What video did you get? 
JERRY: Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan. 
GEORGE: Four hours. 
JERRY: More heavy gravy?   
GEORGE:  Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry.   
NEWMAN: Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. you know.  I rip of the label. I can hardly tell the difference. 
KRAMER: Well, we've officially bottomed out. Who's our next guest? 
NEWMAN: We've got no one! 
KRAMER: We need a new foreman. We should shut down and re-tool.   
NEWMAN: What about a guest-host? 
KRAMER: I'll pretend I didn't hear that.   
MIRANDA: Doctor, how's the squirrel? 
GEORGE: Is he dead? 
DOCTOR: No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. Would you like to visit him? 
MIRANDA: Yes he would. 
DOCTOR: You have 30 minutes.  
GOERGE: So ... uh, squirrel.   
DOCTOR: One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what time you'll be picking him up  tomorrow. 
GEORGE: What's that? 
DOCTOR: Oh, we're discharging the squirrel. We think he'll be better off at home. 
GEORGE: He has no home. He's a squirrel. 
DOCTOR: Your home, Mister Costanza. Just make sure he gets his medicine six times a day and keep his  tail elevated.    
JERRY: Maybe it'll be fun having a pet. 
GEORGE: It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's  gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!   
KRAMER: Jerry, what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set. 
JERRY: What about my "questionable material"? 
KRAMER: Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... we got Jim Fowler! 
JERRY: Jim Fowler? The animal guy from "Wild Kingdom" is coming to your apartment? 
KRAMER: Well, I practically raised his kids. 
GEORGE: That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. Can I bring the squirrel by? 
KRAMER: What? Two animal acts on the same show? What is this, amateur hour? Look, George, I'm  sorry, but maybe another time, all right?  
GEORGE: I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. It's practically  bionic!   
ELAINE: Hey! ha ha Nice sidle, huh? Speaking of which I think I got that problem solved. 
JERRY: Tic-Tacs worked? 
ELAINE: He's a human maraca. 
GEORGE: Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game. 
ELAINE: You took him over to Celia's? 
JERRY: What? It's a victimless crime. 
ELAINE: What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of? 
JERRY: Okay, one victim. 
ELAINE: I think it's unconscionable. 
GEORGE: Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven. 
ELAINE: EZ Bake oven?   
ELAINE: Who wants cupcake? 
GEORGE: Oh, me, me, me, me, me! 
JERRY: You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old. 
FRANK:  You step on it and it flushes. 
ELAINE: Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop? 
ESTELLE:  Stop squirming. 
GEORGE: Oh, don't look. This is the part where they change me. 
JERRY: You're like eight years old. 
ESTELLE:  Georgie. 
GEORGE: I was seven and a half.      
PETERMAN: That noise. that's the noise. 
ELAINE: What? 
PETERMAN: That inferno rattling sound that has plagued me these past two days - and I could not find the  source. In my office, in the hallway. even in the men's room! Shame on you, Elaine! 
ELAINE: No, no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me! 
PETERMAN: That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! You haven't gone over to their side  have you? 
ELAINE: No Mister Peterman. 
PETERMAN: Because, if I hear one more rattle - just one - your out on your can And if you are undead -  I'll find out about that too.    
ELAINE: Lou! In here! We have to talk. 
LOU: Oh, right. 
ELAINE:  No, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these. 
LOU: Why? 
ELAINE: Because they're turning your teeth green? 
LOU: I only buy the white ones. 
ELAINE: Okay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. Just stop carrying these, okay?  Just ... just mouth wash. 
LOU: I can't. It burns my cankers. 
ELAINE: Binacca? 
LOU: Again. 
ELAINE: Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum! 
LOU: I hate gum. The only guy I ever liked came with the Mickey Mouse gumball machine. They stopped  making that about 20 years ago. 
ELAINE: Well, stinky, this is your lucky day.      
KRAMER: Okay. a little later, we're gonna be talking with animal expert Jim Fowler. 
FOWLER: Where are the cameras? 
KRAMER: But first, we're talking with Jerry. Okay, Jerry, uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with  her toy collection. How do you feel about that? 
JERRY: It was great! I've done it a few more time since then. 
KRAMER: And she doesn't know anything about this? 
JERRY: No, not a thing. 
Newman: laughs 
KRAMER: Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia! 
CELIA: What kind of a sick twisted creep are you?  NEWMAN and KRAMER: Woah. 
JERRY: What is this? What is she doing here? 
KRAMER: It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Go with it. 
CELIA: If you think you can drug me and play with my toys, you got another thing coming, buddy! 
NEWMAN: Go girl! 
JERRY: Well, what kind of woman drinks a whole box of wine?  NEWMAN and KRAMER: Ohhh!   
GEORGE: Mister Fowler, I have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science! 
KRAMER: George I told you we're booked! 
FOWLER: Careful. Hawks and squirrels don't get along together. 
KRAMER: Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be spicy. Yeah, George bring him over. 
FOWLER: No, you idiot! Hawks eat squirrels! 
KRAMER: Are we getting this?      
JERRY: So the whole set was destroyed? 
KRAMER: Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing. 
GEORGE: Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry about the set. 
KRAMER: I tell y'a it was a grind trying to fill 10 hours a week. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own  talk show set. 
MIRANDA: I got the nut bread, George. Let's go.  
JERRY: So the squirrel's gonna make it? 
GEORGE: Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch. 
JERRY: Sleeping on the couch? So you're... 
GEORGE: Still getting nothing! So go ahead pigeons. Laugh it up. I'm getting in my car now and the last  think I heard ... we have NO DEAL!   
CELIA: I'm glad you called, Elaine. I really needed to talk to someone. 
ELAINE: Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey? 
CELIA: Who's he?  
ELAINE: Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for y'a.
