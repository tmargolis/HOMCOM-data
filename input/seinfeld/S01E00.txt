JERRY: Seems to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.  The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it: it's too high! It's in no-man's-land, you look like you live with your mother.

GEORGE: Are you through? 

JERRY: You do of course try on, when you buy?

GEORGE: Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don't actually recall considering the buttons.

JERRY: Oh, you don't recall?

GEORGE:  Uh, no, not at this time.

JERRY: Well, senator, I just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it. 

WAITRESS: Mister Seinfeld. 

GEORGE: Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where's the orange indicator?

WAITRESS: It's missing, I have to do it in my head: decaf left, regular right, decaf left, regular right...it's very challenging work. 

JERRY: Can you relax, it's a cup of coffee, Claire is a professional waitress.

WAITRESS: Trust me George: no one has any interest in seeing you on caffeine. 

GEORGE: How come you're not doin' the second show tomorrow?

JERRY: Well, there's this uh, woman might be comin' in.

GEORGE: Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?

JERRY: I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?

GEORGE: No, you didn't!

JERRY: I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing... There's no milk in here, what...

GEORGE: Wait wait wait, what is she,  what is she like?

JERRY: Oh, she's really great. I mean, she's got like a real warmth about her and she's really bright and really pretty and uh...the conversation though, I mean, it was...talking with her is like talking with you, but, ya know, obviously much better.

GEORGE:  So, ya know, what, what happened?

JERRY: Oh, nothing happened, ya know, but is was great.

GEORGE: Oh, nothing happened, but it was...

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: This is great!

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: So, ya know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!

JERRY: Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe we'll get together.

GEORGE:  Ho ho ho, "Had to"? "Had to come in"?

JERRY: Yeah, but...

GEORGE: "Had to come in" and "maybe we'll get together"? "Had to" and "Maybe"?

JERRY: Yeah!

GEORGE: No...no...no, I hate to tell you this: you're not gonna see this woman.

JERRY:  What, are you serious...why, why did she call?

GEORGE: How do I know, maybe, ya know, maybe she wanted to be polite.

JERRY: To be polite? You are insane!

GEORGE: All right, all right, I didn't want to tell you this, you wanna know why she called you?

JERRY: Yes!

GEORGE: You're a back-up, you're a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan of contingency!

JERRY: Oh, I get it, this is about the button.

GEORGE:  Claire, Claire, you're a woman, right?

CLAIRE: What gave it away, George?

GEORGE: Uhm...I'd like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, ya know, from a female point of view.

JERRY:  Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now, how is she gonna know?

GEORGE:  come to New York on business...

JERRY: Oh you are beautiful! 

GEORGE: and, and maybe  she'll see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?

CLAIRE: I'd have to say: uuhh, no. 

GEORGE:  So why did she call?

CLAIRE: To be polite.

GEORGE: To be polite, I rest my case.

JERRY: Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you're talking about, now, come on, come with me , I, I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.

GEORGE: I'm not gonna watch you do laundry.

JERRY: Oh, come on, be a "come-with-guy".

GEORGE: Come on, I'm tired.

CLAIRE:  Don't worry, I gave him a little caffeine: he'll perk up.

GEORGE: 

 



GEORGE: Jerry? I have to tell ya somethin':...this is the dullest moment I've ever experienced. 

JERRY: Well, look at this guy! Look, he's got everything, he's got: detergents, sprays, fabric softeners; this is not his first load.

GEORGE: I need a break, Jerry, ya know, I gotta get out of the city, I feel so cramped...

JERRY: And you didn't even hear how she sounded.

GEORGE: What?!

JERRY: Laura.

GEORGE: I can't believe:  WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!

JERRY: Yeah, but how could you be so sure?

GEORGE: , it's signals! Don't you....all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin' tomorrow night, if you were busy?

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: She calls you today and she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? It's Saturday night!

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: What is that? It's ridiculous!  Signal!

JERRY: Maybe you're right.

GEORGE: Maybe I'm right? Of course I'm right.

JERRY: This is insane. You know, I don't even know where she's staying! She, she's not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.

GEORGE:  Listen, your stuff has to be done by know, why don't you just see if it's dried?

JERRY: No no no, don't interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what it's doing, just let it finish.

GEORGE: You're gonna "overdry" it.

JERRY: You, you can't "overdry".

GEORGE: Why not?

JERRY: Same as you can't "overwet".  You see, once something is wet, it's wet. Same thing with dead: like once you die you're dead, right? Let's say you drop dead and I shoot you: you're not gonna die again, you're already dead. You can't "overdie", you can't "overdry".

GEORGE:  Any questions?

JERRY: How could she not tell me where she was staying? 

GEORGE: 

 



JERRY: "Laundry-day" is the only exciting day in the live of clothes. It is...no, think about it: the washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. Ya know, it's dark, there's bubbles happening, they're all kind a dancing around in there...shirt grabs the underwear: "C'mon babe, let's gather". You come by, you open up the lid and they'll: . They got buttons sowed on their faces: join the puppet show...So they're showing me on television the detergent for getting out blood-stains...Is this a violent image to anybody? Blood-stains? I mean, I, come on, you got a T-shirt with blood-stains all over it, maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem right now...Maybe you oughtta get the harpoon out your chest first.

 



JERRY: 

KRAMER:  Are you up?

JERRY: .

KRAMER: Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh?

JERRY:  I taped the game, it's one o'clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.

KRAMER: Hey, I'm sorry, I...ya know, I, I thought you knew... You got any meat?

JERRY:  Well what, what happened in the game anyway?

KRAMER:  Ya know, I almost wound up going to that game.

JERRY:  Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven't been out of the building in ten years!

KRAMER: Yeah.  Are you done with this?

JERRY: No.

KRAMER:  When you're done, let me know.

JERRY: Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.

KRAMER: I thought I wasn't allowed to be in here this weekend.

JERRY: No, it's OK now, that, that girl is not comin' uh, I, I misread the whole thing.

KRAMER: You want me to talk to her?

JERRY: I don't think so.

KRAMER: Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... a lawyer. 

JERRY: That close, huh?

KRAMER: You better believe it. 

JERRY: Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.

KRAMER: Give me it...let me talk to her .

JERRY: ...

KRAMER: A SLIDE!...Wow!

JERRY: ...No, it's, it's just my neighbour...uhm...yeah, I got it  I, I don't believe it...That, that was her. She wants to stay here!

 



JERRY: If my father was moving this he'd had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way.  Have you got your end?...Your end's got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end's got to come down.

GEORGE: Ya know, I can't believe you're bringin' in an extra bed for woman, that wants to sleep with you. Why don't you bring in an extra guy too? 

JERRY:  Look, it's a very awkward situation, I, I don't wanna be presumptuous.

GEORGE: All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the EXACT phrasing of the request?

JERRY: All right, she said she couldn't find a decent hotel- room...

GEORGE: A decent hotel-room...

JERRY: Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.

GEORGE: You can't be serious. This is New York city: there must be eleven million decent hotel-rooms! Whatta ya need? A flag?  This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!

 

JERRY:  This is the signal. Thank you, mister Signal, where were you yesterday?

GEORGE: I think I was affected by the caffeine. 

KRAMER:  He really likes you, George.

GEORGE:  Well, that's flattering.

KRAMER:  Is this for that girl?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: Why even give her an option?

JERRY: This is a person I like, it's not: "How to score on spring break".

GEORGE: Right, can we go? 'Cause I'm double-parked, I'm gonna get a ticket.

JERRY: Yeah, OK. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I, I forgot to clean the bathroom.

GEORGE: So what? That's good.

JERRY: Now, how could that be good?

GEORGE: Because filth is good...Whatta you think: rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin' around the bathroom? They, they have a woman comin' over: "I've gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.

JERRY: This is how you operate?

GEORGE: Yeah, I wish.

JERRY: Let me just wipe the sink.

KRAMER:  It's unbelievable.

GEORGE: Yeah.

KRAMER: ...How's the real estate-business?

GEORGE:... It's uh, not bad, it's comin' along...Why? Did you need something.

KRAMER: Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?

GEORGE: Well, I might be getting in to that.

KRAMER:  You keep me posted!

GEORGE: I'm aware of you, all right, let's go  You're on stage in 25 minutes.

JERRY: Wouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's thinking?

GEORGE: What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what she's thinkin'.

JERRY: Ya know, instead, I'm like a detective: I've gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.

GEORGE: Listen, listen, don't get worked up, 'cause you're gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.

JERRY: Really? How?

GEORGE: 'Cause it's all in the greeting.

JERRY: Uh-huh.

GEORGE: All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, that's a good sign.

JERRY: Right.

GEORGE: Ya know, anything in the, in the "lip-area" is good.

JERRY: "Lip-area".

GEORGE: Ya know a hug: definitely good.

JERRY: Hug is definitely good.

GEORGE: Sure.

JERRY: Although what if it's one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?

GEORGE: That's so brutal, I hate that.

JERRY: Ya know how they do that?

GEORGE: That's why, ya know, a shake is bad.

JERRY: Shake is bad, but what if it's the "two-hander"? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?

GEORGE: Hand-sandwich.

JERRY: Right.

GEORGE: I see, well, that's open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes...

LAURA: Guess who?

JERRY: Hey, hey.

LAURA and JERRY: Heeeey! 

JERRY: It's good to see you.

LAURA: Hi.

JERRY: This is my friend George.

LAURA:  Hi, how nice to meet you.

GEORGE: Hi, how are you?

JERRY: This is Laura.

GEORGE: Laura, sure.

JERRY:  I can't believe you're here.

GEORGE and JERRY: Ooh yeah, the bags, sure. 

LAURA: Oh, thank you.

JERRY:  Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?

GEORGE: Yes, the "surprise-blindfold-greeting". That wasn't in the manual, I don't know.

 



JERRY: So uh, what do ya think?

LAURA: Ooohhh, wow! This place isn't so bad.

JERRY: Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road...So uh, make yourself at home.  So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?

LAURA:  Actually uhm, do you have any wine?

JERRY; Uh, yeah, I think I do.

LAURA: Oh, do, do you mind if I turn this down? 

JERRY: Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead. 

LAURA: Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wandering: would it be possible, and if it's not, fine, for me to stay here tomorrow night too?

JERRY: Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don't you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin' anything?

LAURA: No, I'd love to do something, uh, I have my seminar in the morning, then after that I'm right open.

JERRY: Really? What would you like to do?

LAURA: Well...now I know this sounds touristy, but I'd just love to go on one of those five-hour-boat-rides around Manhattan.

JERRY:  Uhm, it's for you.

LAURA: . Never get engaged.

JERRY: You're engaged?

LAURA: You, you really have no idea what it's like until you actually do it and I'm on this emotional roller coaster.

JERRY: You're engaged? 

LAURA: Ya know, I can't believe it myself sometimes. You have to start thinking in terms of "we", uh, it's a very stressful situation.

JERRY: You're engaged! 

LAURA: Yeah...yeah, he's a great guy...

JERRY: Yeah.

LAURA: You'd really like him...ya know, I can't wait to get on that boat.

JERRY: Me too!
