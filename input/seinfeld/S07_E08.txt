GEORGE: Let me ask you a question. Who would win in a fight between you and me? 
JERRY: Well, what do you mean? 
GEORGE: Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win? 
JERRY: Well I think that's pretty obvious. 
GEORGE: Yeah. Me too.   
JERRY: Hey Elaine. 
ELAINE: Hey. 
JERRY: Who, who, who do you think would win in a fight between me and ah, gorgeous George here.  
ELAINE: You mean in a real Fight Fight? 
JERRY: Mona a Baldo. 
ELAINE: George. 
GEORGE: Ah-Ha!  
JERRY: Why? 
ELAINE: George fights dirty.  
JERRY: Really? What would you do? 
GEORGE: Pull hair, Poke eyes, Groin stuff. Whatever I gotta do.  
JERRY: Hmm. 
ELAINE: So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you? Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met. 
JERRY: I’m sorry. 
ELAINE: George? 
GEORGE: Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral? 
ELAINE: There's nobody I can go with.   
ELAINE: You know what. I don't have one female friend left. 
KRAMER: Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate other women, and they hate you. 
ELAINE: Thank you. 
KRAMER: So Jerry,  What time we going to the movies? 
JERRY: Ah, how about 8:30? 
KRAMER: Saddle up and ride.  
JERRY: You want to get something to eat first? 
KRAMER:  No, I’m good. 
GEORGE: I wonder if, ah, Susan ...  No. I better just go.  heh. All right! See ya.  
KRAMER: There's nothing more pathetic, than a grown man, who’s afraid of a woman.  
JERRY: Hey, why don't cha ask Susan? 
ELAINE: George's Susan? 
JERRY: Yeah. 
ELAINE: Yeah. Why not Susan. I should be friends with Susan.  Of course! Susan! Oh! OK, I’ll see you guys. Huh.  
KRAMER: That's gunna be trouble. 
JERRY: Why? 
KRAMER: Jerry, don't you see? This world here, this is George's sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's collide. You know what happens then?   
KRAMER: Ka shha shha shha Pkooo   
KRAMER: Did I tell you I’m getting a new telephone number? 
JERRY: How come? 
KRAMER: Whew, chicks man. Too many chicks know my number.   
RAMON:  Hey Jerry. How are you Mr. Backstroke? 
JERRY: Kramer this is Ramon, from the new health club I joined. 
KRAMER: Oh, yeah. 
RAMON: So you know what happened don't chu? 
JERRY: No what? 
RAMON: I got fired. 
JERRY: Really? 
RAMON: Yeah, said I put too much chlorine in the pool. 
JERRY: Ahh. 
RAMON: Hey well, ah, stay out of the deep end, eh. 
JERRY: OK, see you later. 
KRAMER: What's in the deep end?      
GEORGE: Hello? 
ELAINE: Hey George. 
GEORGE: Hey Elainie. What's going on? 
ELAINE:  Nothing much, um. Can I talk to Susan 
GEORGE: Ha, Yeah right, hang on, I’ll ah, I’ll get her for you. he, he, he, he. Seriously, what's up? 
ELAINE: No, George really. Can I talk to Susan? 
GEORGE: Susan, why? 
ELAINE: Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow. 
GEORGE: Oh, I don't think you want to do that. 
ELAINE: Why not? 
GEORGE: Well what would be the point of that?   
ELAINE: George, are you going to put her on the phone? 
GEORGE: Where did this come from all of a sudden? 
ELAINE: George, are you going to let me talk to Susan, or Not? 
GEORGE: I really think I should have been consulted about this.   
GEORGE: Here ... something. 
SUSAN: Hello?  Oh, that sounds great. I love that sort of stuff.    
KRAMER: You want to sit here? 
JERRY: Yeah.  Uh, uh, oh, oh, Over there.  
KRAMER: Why? 
JERRY: Little buffer zone. 
KRAMER:  Buffer zone  
JERRY: Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other? 
KRAMER: No. You got a point. 
JERRY: All right. 
KRAMER: I can't ... 
JERRY: What are you doing? 
KRAMER: Well these seats have no lumbar. 
JERRY: Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking.   
KRAMER: We are talking. 
JERRY: Pretend it's interesting. 
KRAMER: So, ah then, I ah had to kill him and ah, well the police are still looking for me. 
JERRY: Oh yeah that's shocking, but sounds ... 
RAMON: Hey, hi Jerry. 
JERRY: Oh, hey Ramon. 
RAMON: Hey, hey, I took a bunch of napkins. You want some? 
JERRY: Oh, no thanks.  
RAMON: Hey, ahhh, is this seat taken?   
JERRY: No.    
JERRY: And then the worst part is, after the movie, he leached on to us ... We wound up having coffee with him for like two hours. Then he walks us home, all the way back to the front of the building. Finally I said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now. 
GEORGE: By the way, have you spoken to Elaine yet today? 
JERRY: No why? 
GEORGE:  She called Susan last night. 
JERRY: Oh yeah, I know. 
GEORGE: How do you know? 
JERRY: Well it was my idea. 
GEORGE: Your idea? 
JERRY: Yeah. 
GEORGE: Wha’d you do that for? 
JERRY: She was looking for someone to go to the show with. 
GEORGE: Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to happen now? 
JERRY: World's collide.  
GEORGE: Whe ... Well yeah! 
JERRY: Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into contact with -- 
GEORGE: YES! It Blows Up! So if you know that, what did you tell Elaine for? 
JERRY: I didn’t know. Kramer told me about the worlds. 
GEORGE: You couldn't figure out the “World's Theory” for yourself? It's just common sense. Anybody knows, ya gotta keep your worlds apart.  
JERRY: Yeah, I guess I slipped up.   
KRAMER: Hey. 
GEORGE: Hey. 
JERRY: Hey. 
GEORGE: He knows the worlds theory. 
KRAMER: What is it blowing up? 
GEORGE: Ha!    
KRAMER: Cosmo, go. No, no, na, na.  Boy this new telephone number's driving me crazy -- wrong numbers, every five minutes. 
JERRY: What is it? 
KRAMER: Well it's 555-3455. 
JERRY: 555-3455. 
KRAMER: Yeah. 
JERRY:  “555-3455.” Well wait a second, don't you see that's 555-FILK. 
KRAMER: What's Filk? 
JERRY: Filk’s nothing, but 555-FILM is Movie Phone. 
KRAMER: Oh Movie Phone. 
JERRY: Yes, so people are just dialing it by mistake and getting you. 
KRAMER: So, I’m Filk? 
JERRY: You're Filk. 
KRAMER: Oh, Mama.   
ELAINE: Well what about that number Susan B. Anthony wore to the 19th Amendment party. Hnuh. Eye yye yye. 
SUSAN: Oh whoo. Quite the DColletage for a suffragette. 
ELAINE: Ha, ha, ha, ha, well it must have been one hell of a party. 
SUSAN: Whoo. 
ELAINE: Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
SUSAN: Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you. 
ELAINE: What? 
SUSAN: Ehahh, forget it. 
ELAINE: What? You can tell me. I’ll put it in the vault. 
SUSAN: The vault? 
ELAINE: Mm-Hmm.    
PAUL - Locker room Attendant #1: Oy, Mr. Seinfeld. We heard you went to the movies with Ramon. 
JERRY: Oh, well, I didn’t actually go with Ramon. I just bumped into him there.   
DUSTIN - Locker room Attendant #2: It's a good thing he has friends like you to cheer him up. 
PAUL: Tell him to call us. 
DUSTIN: Tell him, Dustin says, “Hello.” 
JERRY: All right, I gotta go. 
PAUL: To see Ramon?     
JERRY: What else did you two do? 
ELAINE: Oh, I don't know, you know, girlie stuff. 
JERRY: Ah, so, ah, flower shows and, shopping for pretty bows, and then back to her place, strip down to bra and panties for a tickle fight?   
ELAINE: That's really what you think girls do, isn't it? 
JERRY: Yes, I do.  
ELAINE: All rightee.  
JERRY: Hey you know George isn't to happy, ahh, about your new friendship. 
ELAINE: Yeah? Well I don't really give a Sh...    
KRAMER: Hey man, what's going on? 
JERRY: Hey.   
KRAMER: Ooh, here we go.  Yeah hello. Yeah, no, no, no, hold on.   
KRAMER: Yeah, Cupid’s Rifle -- 8:30, Sony Lincoln Square. Yeah, no, no, no, no problem, yeah.   
JERRY: You're looking up movies for people now? 
KRAMER: I got time.   
KRAMER: And this.  Cosmo here. Yeah, un-huh, no, no, no, no, I’ll help. Yeah, Firestorm’s good. I saw it yesterday. Yeah well my buddy Jerry , ah, he's seen it twice. You want to talk to him? Here --  
JERRY:  No Kramer I don't want to talk to him.     ** Continuity Error -- During this part of the scene, we clearly see Kramer’s right hand holding the phone, his left hand is empty. This sequence is shot from several camera angles. At the end of the sequence, Kramer is holding the folded newspaper in his left hand -- he did not reach over to pick up the paper -- so this is obviously a Continuity Error ** 
KRAMER: Just, just tell him about the picture. What's the matter with you? Stop it.  Yes, are you still there? Look I’m sorry about that. All right there's an 8:30 and a 10:15 showing.     
JERRY: Oh that's George.  Yeah? 
RAMON:  
JERRY: What? 
RAMON:  
JERRY:  Oh. Okay.  Wh, what is he doing here? 
ELAINE: Who? Who is Ramon? 
JERRY: He's the pool guy. 
ELAINE: What pool guy? 
JERRY: Do me a favor. Just stick around while he's here. 
ELAINE: Yeah, no problem.  ---------------------------------------------------- ** Inconsistency in reality -- Ramon shows up at Jerry's door, 8 seconds from the time when Jerry stops pressing the intercom buzzer. Either Ramon would have to run up 5 flights of stairs incredibly fast  or those are some very fast elevators.  -- and we know from a Episode 6 The Ex-Girlfriend that Elaine complains about the slow elevators in Jerry's apt. building. **  Episode 6 The Ex-Girlfriend
ELAINE: You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones. 
JERRY: Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time. ---------------------------------------------------- 
RAMON: Hee hey, hey Jerry  How are you, crazy guy? 
JERRY: Hey. So, ah, Ramon this is my friend Elaine. 
ELAINE: Yeah and I was just leaving. Bye-bye Jerry.  
JERRY: So, ah, what are you doing around here Ramon? 
RAMON: Well, I was in the neighborhood. I figured I’d check you out. 
JERRY: Ah, actually, I ka, kinda had some things to do. 
RAMON: Oh, oh yeah. Wha? Where you going? 
JERRY: Ah, just, you know, I don't know. Stuff, I gotta do.  
RAMON: Hey that's cool. I’m up for some stuff 
JERRY: All right.     
RAMON: So get this. I get down there, and right away, I see the drain is clogged. I mean it's obvious. Can you believe it? 
JERRY: All right Ramon, I’m going to get going.   
JERRY: I think we should separate here actually. 
RAMON: What are you trying to say Jerry? 
JERRY: Look Ramon, you're, you're a nice guy. But I, I actually only have three friends. I really can't handle any more. 
RAMON: Oh I see. It's cause I clean pools, right? 
JERRY: That has nothing to do with it. 
RAMON: You su --     
SUSAN: Yeah, we got along real well. 
GEORGE: You know, uh, she has no female friends! You know that, don't cha? Something strange about a woman who’s friends are all men. 
SUSAN: Yeah, I know. We talked all about that. 
GEORGE: You talked all about that? 
SUSAN: Oh yeah. Elaine opened up her vault. 
GEORGE: Did you just say vault? 
SUSAN: Yeah, why? Did I use it wrong? 
GEORGE: You got that from Elaine. 
SUSAN: Yeah. So what? 
GEORGE: Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like Elaine from now on? 
SUSAN: I don't know. Anyway I thought we'd all go to a movie on Friday. 
GEORGE: We’d all go to movie on Friday? 
SUSAN: Yeah. 
GEORGE: This is not good. World's are colliding! George is getting upset!      
GEORGE: Ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing. If she is allowed to infiltrate this world, then George Costanza as you know him, Ceases to Exist! You see, right now, I have Relationship George, but there is also Independent George. That's the George you know, the George you grew up with -- Movie George, Coffee shop George, Liar George, Bawdy George. 
JERRY: I, I love that George. 
GEORGE: Me Too! And he's Dying Jerry! If Relationship George walks through this door, he will Kill Independent George! A George, divided against itself, Cannot Stand!   
GEORGE: You're Killing Independent George! You know that, don't you? 
ELAINE: George I don't even want to get -- 
GEORGE: You know what word Susan used last night? Hnuh. Vault! hu, hu, hu. 
ELAINE: So? 
GEORGE: She got that from you! 
ELAINE: Well, I didn’t tell here to say it. 
GEORGE: What is she the only girl in the whole world? Why can’t you get find your own girl? 
ELAINE: I Like Her! 
GEORGE: You see . You see. You see what I’m talking about. It's all just slipping away. And you're letting it happen.  
JERRY: So you want to catch a movie later? 
ELAINE: Ahh, yeah, sure. 
JERRY: I don't have a paper though. 
ELAINE: Hmm.

JERRY: What? 
RAMON: I’m a pool boy ... again. 
JERRY: Look Ramon, about the other day. I’m sorry if I offended you. I get a little crabby on the subway. 
RAMON: Do you? 
JERRY: What happened to all the towels? 
RAMON: Oh, ah, I guess they must have disappeared.    
NEWMAN: Hey Jerry. Look at all the towels they gave me! I really hit the jackpot!  Ha, ha, ha.     
JERRY: It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker ... 
ELAINE: Uh-huh. 
JERRY: And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone. 
ELAINE: Uhh, so frustrating! 
JERRY: Tell me about it. 
ELAINE: Uhh, so you want to join me and Susan for lunch at the coffee shop? 
JERRY: You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop? 
ELAINE: Yeah. 
JERRY: I’m meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop. 
ELAINE: Oh, huh. Well, this should be very interesting.

JERRY: This is gonna to be ugly.    
SUSAN: What's that Jerry? 
JERRY:  I said, boy am I ugly.   
SUSAN: Oh, hey, hey, Georgie boy, over here.   
GEORGE: One, two ... three, four.   
GEORGE: Ha Ho!  
SUSAN: Hey George! 
JERRY: We'll pull up another chair.   
JERRY: I see you there Ramon.   
JERRY: Hey, l‘ll just keep swimming. Hey, hey. I’m not done. I know what you're up to Ramon. Because I’m a member here, this is my place to swim.   
JERRY: Hey, you better cut it out Ramon. Just stop it.   
RAMON: Oh.   
NEWMAN: Olly, olly, oxen, free!   
JERRY:   Camera fade to Ramon, lying unconscious on the tile pool deck. Newman and Jerry are kneeling over him. 
JERRY: I think he's gonna need, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. 
NEWMAN: Mouth-to-mouth? 
JERRY: Yeah. 
NEWMAN: Huh. 
JERRY: Well? Go ahead. 
NEWMAN: You go. 
JERRY: You knocked him out. 
NEWMAN: Yeah, but you pulled him in. 
JERRY: Come on Newman. Do it. 
NEWMAN: Nah. 
JERRY: He might die. 
NEWMAN: Yeah. Maybe.    
ELAINE:  Look Jerry, we'll meet you at the theater.  OK, next showings at 9:00, we can't wait any longer. 
SUSAN: Elaine, where could he be? It's not like George to just disappear. 
ELAINE: Look, let's just leave him a note, okay? 
SUSAN: Oh, I don't know. 
ELAINE: Oh, come on, come on, come on.  “George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry.” Love? 
SUSAN: Yeah. 
ELAINE: “Love ... Susan.”   
JERRY: So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him mouth-to-mouth. 
ELAINE: He could have died 
JERRY: Yeah, it was a gamble. 
SUSAN: Why didn’t you give him mouth-to-mouth? 
JERRY: Ah.  
ELAINE: How can you possibly show your face there again? 
JERRY: Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too. You know, we can't go anywhere near there.   
ELAINE: Hi, ah, three for Chunnel -- two adults ... one child.    
GEORGE: What the hell is this? “George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry.” With Jerry, huh? With Jerry! Great. Great!  Probably went to the 84th St. That's where I always go with Jerry.
