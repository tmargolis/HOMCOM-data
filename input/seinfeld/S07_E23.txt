JERRY: New hairdo? 
ELAINE:  Yeah. 
JERRY: You look like Brenda Starr. 
ELAINE: Is that good? 
JERRY: It's better than Dondi.   
ELAINE: Hey, my God, look at that.  David and Beth Lookner.  You  know, I heard a rumor their marriage was a little rocky. 
JERRY:  Really? 
ELAINE: Mm-hmm. 
JERRY: You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner. 
ELAINE: Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind of sponge-worthy.  
JERRY: Yeah.. I've been waitin' out their marriage for three years. 
ELAINE: Yeah, me too. Well, I've been waiting out two or three marriages, but this is the one I really had my eye on.   
GEORGE: This car out there is taking up, like, three parking spaces.   
ELAINE: Oh,  that's mine. 
GEORGE: You have a car? 
ELAINE: Well, my friend, Alyse, lent it to me for the week. She's out of town. 
JERRY:  You know, I've never seen you drive. 
GEORGE: Me either.   
BETH:  Jerry? Elaine, Hi! 
ELAINE:  Hi, David! 
JERRY: Hi, Beth! 
BETH: Oh, uh, George,  this is my husband, David. 
GEORGE: Oh, hi..  
DAVID: Hello. So, George, uh, you're the one who works for the Yankees, right? 
GEORGE: Yeah. Why, what do you do? 
DAVID: Well, I sell insurance, but Beth used to be Don Mattingly's doctor. 
GEORGE: Really? 
BETH: Mm-hm. 
DAVID: Yeah. 
GEORGE:  A physician married to a salesman.  Well, I gotta tell you, Beth, you coulda done a lot better than him.         
KRAMER: Hey! 
JERRY: Hey. Hey, Mickey. What's going on? 
MICKEY: I'm very nervous. I'm auditioning to be in the Actor's Studio tonight. 
JERRY: Really? 
KRAMER: It's a method, Jerry. It's intense.  
MICKEY: Kramer's going to be my scene partner. 
JERRY: Kramer? 
MICKEY: He doesn't have to say anything, he just has to sit there. I'm playing a detective. 
KRAMER: Yeah, and I'm playing a business man accused of murder. 
JERRY: Ohh boy. Well, I gotta meet Elaine and run some errands. So..  
KRAMER:  Yeah.. look at this, Mickey. These pants are fallin' apart, huh? 
JERRY:  You know, when I first met you, Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time. 
KRAMER:  Yeah, well, I was a different man then. 
JERRY:  With a different body. 
KRAMER:  Hey, I got the body of a.. taught, pre-teen, Swedish boy.   
JERRY: Ehh, I dunno.. 
KRAMER: Now, what are you thinkin'?  You think that I'm not able to wear jeans anymore? Is that what you're sayin'? Because if that's what you're  sayin', Jerry, I'll go and I'll buy some jeans.  I swear to God I will!  Don't think I won't, Jerry!       
ELAINE: God, it is so great to drive again. I miss it so much!  How about a left turn signal, ya moron?!   Woah.. 
JERRY:  I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver. 
ELAINE: You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog.  I think it was a golden retriever. No, no, no, it was a - it was a yellow lab.  I'm gonna check my messages.  
MAN: Hey! 
JERRY:  I'm so car sick. I'm gonna vomit!   
ELAINE: Oh my God! Jerry! My friend, Kim called - David and Beth got separated last night! 
JERRY:  Huh? 
ELAINE: They're gettin' divorced!        
ELAINE: So, now, what is our move? What do we do? 
JERRY: I don't know, but we don't have much time. 
ELAINE:  Mm. 
JERRY: The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting out that marriage. 
ELAINE: Right. 
JERRY: It's like when someone dies in a rent controlled building - you gotta take immediate action. 
ELAINE: Yeeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving time. 
JERRY: Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford. I'm calling Beth tonight, and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you do likewise. 
ELAINE:  Yeah, yeah.. 
JERRY: But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates. 
ELAINE: Then why are we calling? 
JERRY: Good question.  Why are we calling?   
ELAINE:  Oh!  I've got it! I've got it! We're calling just to say, "I'm there for you." 
JERRY:  "I'm there for you." 
ELAINE: Then, after a period of being "there for you", we slowly remove the two words "for you", and we're just  "there".       
ELAINE: Hey. 
JERRY: Hey, remember Beth and David from yesterday? They got separated. 
GEORGE: Really?  Well, you don't think it had anything to do with what I said, do you? 
JERRY: What'd you say? 
GEORGE: You know, that, that thing about her being too good for him. I mean, I was just bein' folksy. They could tell I was just being folksy..? 
ELAINE: Yeah, I thought you were being folksy. 
GEORGE: Totally folksy.   
JERRY: hey, uh..  what'd you get there? 
KRAMER: Uh, yeah, I bought Dungarees. 
ELAINE: Kramer, they're painted on! 
KRAMER: Well, they're slim-fit. 
JERRY: Slim-fit? 
KRAMER:  Yeah, they're streamlined. 
JERRY: You're walkin' like Frankenstein! 
KRAMER:  What? They just gotta be worked in a little bit, that's all.  Alright, see you later.         
ELAINE:  Well.. David, it happens.   
JERRY: Sure, Beth, these things happen.  So, have you told many.. people yet?   
ELAINE: Because it's really nobody's business.   
JERRY: Anyway, I just called to tell you that, I'm there for you.   
ELAINE: "There" is, um.. anywhere you want me to be..   
JERRY: Sure, dinner would be fine.   
ELAINE: And I could just be there.  For you.   
KRAMER: Jerry, you gotta help me! 
JERRY: What's wrong? 
KRAMER: I can't get my pants off, and Mickey's audition is in twenty minutes! You know, I'm supposed to be a business man, I gotta be in costume! 
JERRY: Alright, alright. Uh, undo them. I'll help you get them off. 
KRAMER:  Yeah, I already did it. It won't come off. The zipper's suck..
