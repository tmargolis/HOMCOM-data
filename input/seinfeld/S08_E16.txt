JENNA: Morning. 
JERRY: Morning.  She hands him a tube of toothpaste. 
JENNA: Hope you don't mind baking soda flavour. 
JERRY:  Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. 'I can do this. I can do that.' Why doesn't this stuff just shut up? 
JENNA: I'm gonna grab you a towel.  
JERRY: Ooh-ooh    Jerry and George in a booth, as per usual. 
GEORGE: So? 
JERRY: So? She used the toothbrush! 
GEORGE: You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right? 
JERRY: Yeah. 
GEORGE: So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out, and by the time the rest of them realised what was going on, you had already grabbed it out. 
JERRY: How many years of med school did you have? 
GEORGE: Was she mad?   
GEORGE: You didn't tell her. 
JERRY: Jenna's like me. She's very...  
GEORGE: Finicky? Prissy? Fastidious? 
JERRY: I'll take fastidious.  George puts his keys on the table. On the ring is a miniature head, clearly a caricature of someone. 
JERRY: What is that? 
GEORGE: Ahh, Steinbrenner gave 'em to us, in honour of Phil Rizzuto being inducted into the Hall of Fame.  
JERRY: They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they? 
GEORGE: Just the last few innings of a double-header.  
KRAMER: Hey. Look at this. I'm in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt expressway, going seventy and  Dragged this thing for five exits.  
JERRY: Why didn't you pull over? 
KRAMER: Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The infrastructure, Jerry, it's crumbling.   
HEAD: Holy cow! 
KRAMER: Well, look at that. A talking Nixon.    
OWNER: China Panda. 
ELAINE: Yeah, I'd like to place an order. 
OWNER: Ah yes, what you like? 
ELAINE: This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that true? 
OWNER: What number? 
ELAINE: Forty-seven. 
OWNER: Yeah, first time. What else? 
ELAINE: Uh, that's it. 
OWNER: Address? 
ELAINE: Seventy-eight, West Eighty-sixth Street. Apartment three E. 
OWNER: That's southside. Sorry, we don't deliver below Eighty-sixth. 
ELAINE: I'm not below. 
OWNER: Yes you are. Street itself is boundary. 
ELAINE: Your guy can't cross to my side? 
OWNER: If we deliver to you, then what? Eighty-fifth Street, Wall Street, Mexico, Eighty-fourth Street. 
ELAINE: Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him. 
OWNER: Sorry, food only for those who live within boundary.   
OWNER:  China Panda. 
ELAINE:  Uh, yeah yeah. I'd like to place an order. 
OWNER: Ah, what you like?    
JERRY: Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point. 
KRAMER:  Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway. 
JERRY: Oh, that adopt-a-highway thing. 
KRAMER: Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one-fourteen.  
JERRY: Aw, looks just like you. 
KRAMER: Aw, I'm beaming Jerry. 
JERRY: So what d'you have to do? Pay to keep it clean? 
KRAMER: They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their so-called maintenance equipment. 
JERRY: That old scam. 
KRAMER: Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there. 
JERRY: At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage. 
KRAMER: Quality time.  
GEORGE: Keys. I can't find my keys. 
JERRY: You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?! 
GEORGE: Have you seen 'em? 
JERRY: No. 
GEORGE: Dammit! 
KRAMER: C'mon, retrace your steps. What d'you do today? 
GEORGE: I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead. 
KRAMER: Right. 
JERRY: Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set. 
GEORGE: I don't have a spare set. All my keys say 'do not duplicate'. 
JERRY: So? 
GEORGE: So you can't duplicate 'em.  
KRAMER: Sure you can.  Such a sweet kid.    
ELAINE: Oh. Oh, hi. China Panda?  
DELIVERY BOY:  Why you waiting on the street and not in your apartment? 
ELAINE: I... thought that I would meet you halfway.  She takes the bag of food.  
DELIVERY BOY: You really live here? 
ELAINE: Oh yeah.  There you go, keep the change. Bye now. I'll see you.  
ELAINE:  This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!    
JERRY: Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf. 
GEORGE: So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?  
JERRY: By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it? 
GEORGE: No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to.  Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!  
GEORGE: Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound. 
JERRY: You didn't look down? 
GEORGE: I was trying to stick the landing.  ...was right around here.  
GEORGE: No! No!!  A car drives by, running right over the patch.  
HEAD: Holy, Holy Cow! 
JERRY: Poor son of a bitch.    
JERRY: It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make. 
JENNA: It's like I'm holding a blender. 
JERRY: The engine's made by McDonnell-Douglas.  Jerry begins to wander into the living room. 
JERRY: Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically. 
JENNA:  Really, it does? 
JERRY:  When the battery runs out. 
JENNA:  I was really happy with my old toothbrush.  
JERRY: No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too.
JENNA : That stuff tastes like bleach!  Jerry is looking for a place to put the soiled brush. 
JERRY: I don't know anything about that.  
JENNA: Mmm. My mouth feels so clean. 
JERRY: That's the idea.  
JERRY: You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs. 
JENNA: Aww. Okay. Thanks, I guess.    
JERRY: She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there. 
ELAINE: Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level. 
JERRY: Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser. 
ELAINE: Jer, do you see where this is going? 
JERRY: Being really clean and happy? 
ELAINE: Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder. 
JERRY: Disorder? 
ELAINE: And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia. 
JERRY:  Hmm, that could hurt me.  Hey, there it is.  
ELAINE: Shall we stop and say hi? 
JERRY: Nah, we've seen it. 
ELAINE: Yeah.    
KRAMER:  Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house!  He drops the last handful of trash into a bag. 
KRAMER: Mile one-fourteen, clean as a whistle.  
MAN: Yeah? 
ELAINE: Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh,  I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I could use your apartment to order some food? 
MAN: Wha? What d'you want? 
ELAINE: You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my side of the street. 
MAN: Wh, when is that? 
ELAINE: No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is all. 
MAN: Who are you with? 
ELAINE: No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry. 
MAN: Who let you in? 
ELAINE: Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I just need like a half an hour to an hour.  
JERRY: What's with the signs? 
KRAMER: Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, 
JERRY: Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway. 
KRAMER:  Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. See? They slipped a one in there.  Those kids with the spray paint, God love 'em.  
JERRY: Hey. So, keys? 
GEORGE: No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole. 
JERRY: I guess they leave that up to the general population. 
GEORGE: I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't be happening! 
JERRY: Hard to say. 
KRAMER: Hey, you need some roadwork done? 'Cos I met some maintenance guys today on the highway, they could probably help you out. 
GEORGE: Really? 
KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my car-pool lane.  
JERRY: Yeah?  JENNA : It's Jenna.   
JERRY: If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.  
GEORGE: You think you could hook me up with these guys? 
KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency callbox seven-eight-four. 
GEORGE: Seven-eight-four.  
JENNA: Hey. 
JERRY: Hi. 
JENNA: How you feeling? 
JERRY: Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you, which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.  
JENNA: What?! 
JERRY: Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip,  and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it. 
JENNA: What? 
JERRY: I'm sorry. 
JENNA: When were you gonna tell me this?! 
JERRY: Obviously never.   
KRAMER: I need the yield sign.  
JERRY: Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here, please?  
KRAMER: You could've introduced me. 
JERRY: I wouldn't know where to start.  
JERRY:  Hey, Jenna. Hey!  
JENNA: There. Now something of yours has been in the toilet. 
JERRY: What?! Wha... what'd you put in there? 
JENNA: Gotta run.  
JERRY: Oh, man!     
JERRY:  Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit!   
ELAINE: She won't even give you a hint? 
JERRY: No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard. 
ELAINE: You know what I bet it is?  Your remote. 
JERRY: Yes, that is a definite possibility.  
ELAINE:  Or, could be your walkman there.  
JERRY: Are you just screwing with me? 
ELAINE: Yeah, I am.  
KRAMER: Hey ah. 
JERRY: Hey, how's life on the road? 
KRAMER: Oh, I'm making a difference Jerry. 
JERRY: I don't doubt it.   
KRAMER: You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces. I mean, you gotta look quick, but they're there.   
JERRY: What's this? 
KRAMER: Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines?  
JERRY: Isn't that some kind of safety thing? 
KRAMER: Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes. 
JERRY: What the hell are you talking about? 
KRAMER: Ah, you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room, better ride? Well, I'm bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen.  
ELAINE: How are you gonna widen the lanes? 
KRAMER: Well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway becomes a two-lane comfort cruise.  So, you got any black paint? 
JERRY:  Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower. 
ELAINE:  Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number forty-seven. Yeah, apartment one-Q. 
JERRY: One-Q? Whose apartment is that? 
ELAINE: That's the janitor closet, across the street. 
JERRY: You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this flounder? 
ELAINE: It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser.  
KRAMER: That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster. 
ELAINE:  How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery zone. 
KRAMER: Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the weekends. 
ELAINE: Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys.   
KRAMER: Now, where's that tool shed of yours?    
ELAINE: Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower.  
ELAINE: I'll see you.  
RALPH: You Costanza? 
GEORGE: Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole. 
RALPH: What're the keys doing in there? 
GEORGE: Just need to uh, to dig 'em up. 
RALPH: You put 'em in there? 
GEORGE: Nah, nah, it's uh, it's a long story. Just uh, try to get it up. 
RALPH: Bad place to put your keys. 
GEORGE: Yeah, I know that.  Could you start, working? 
RALPH: Difficult job. You want those keys, we're gonna have to dig this up. 
GEORGE:  Oh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute.  Is this about money? 
RALPH: Yeah.  It's about money.    
MRS ALLISTER: 'Scuse me, what are you doing in there? 
ELAINE: Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there.  
MRS ALLISTER: You were hanging around in there, lazing on the job. When you shoulda been downstairs in the basement, cleaning out those old carpets and scrap wood. 
ELAINE: Right, because... I'm the janitor.   
MRS ALLISTER: Don't get smart with me. 
ELAINE:  Yes ma'am.    
RADIO: Hey, and if you're heading north on the Arthur Berkhardt, whoah Nelly, for some reason four lanes are converging into two, instantaneously right at mile-marker one-fourteen. I don't know what that is, but the A-B's a parking lot out there. Somebody screwed up on that one.  
ELAINE: Oh it's you. 
JERRY: Is the flounder here yet? 
ELAINE: No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?   
ELAINE:  There's this. 
JERRY: Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a slop-bucket.  
ELAINE:  The fish!  
ELAINE: Ah, what're you doing here? 
GEORGE: Hey. 
JERRY: Hey.  
GEORGE: Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd drop by. 
JERRY: Kramer's guys? 
GEORGE: Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the jackhammering myself. 
JERRY: Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp.  
GEORGE: Ow! 
ELAINE: Uh, man!  
KRAMER: Huh, yeah.  Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, d'you have any paint thinner? I need like uh, forty gallons. 
ELAINE: I'm plumb out. 
KRAMER: Oh man, if I don't get that black paint off the City's gonna go ape. I don't wanna lose my baby!  
MRS ALLISTER : Janitor? 
ELAINE:  Uh, Mrs Allister.  Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs Allister.  Okay, I've gotta get out.  
ELAINE: Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door.  
ELAINE: Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you?  MRS ALLISTER: I told you yesterday to haul that trash outta the basement. 
ELAINE: Yeah, I am so sorry.  
MRS ALLISTER: Some of the children have been playing near it and putting it in their mouths. 
ELAINE: Well, a lot of it is vegetable... 
MRS ALLISTER: Get that stuff outta there today, or you'll be outta here. Understand? 
ELAINE:  Yes ma'am.  
GEORGE: ...stop pushing.   
JERRY: I don't feel like eating. 
KRAMER:  I'm gonna borrow this, huh? 
ELAINE:  Janitor's meeting.    
JENNA: So Jerry, why'd you call me? 
JERRY: Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl.  Did you? 
JENNA: Yes, I did. 
JERRY: Well, whatever. So, how've you been? 
JENNA: Good. 
JERRY: Good.  Steak knife? 
JENNA: Just eating away at you isn't it? 
JERRY: Nah.  T
ELAINE: Hi. 
JENNA: Hi. 
JERRY: Hi. 
ELAINE: Hi. Jerry, can I borrow your car? 
JERRY: For what? 
ELAINE: I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump. 
JERRY: Dirt? That's alright,  because there's nothing wrong with dirt. 
ELAINE: Well, actually it's pretty grimy. 
JERRY: Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery.  
ELAINE: Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car. 
JERRY: Sure. Bye. 
ELAINE: Bye. 
JENNA: Bye. 
ELAINE: Bye.  
JERRY: There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all sorts of...  Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is it? What is it?! 
JENNA: Toilet brush. 
JERRY: Toilet brush, oh . Alright, I can replace that. 
JENNA: You wanna order dinner? 
JERRY: Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes.
JERRY: That's true. 
JENNA: Mm. 
JERRY: But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting relationship.    G
JENNA: Do you hear something?  
JERRY: I don't know what that could be.  
HEAD: Holy cow!  
JERRY: Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.  
JERRY: Holy cow! Have a nice life.  
ELAINE: Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo, yeah.   
KRAMER: Bugger!    
NEWMAN:  You're once. Twice. Three times a lady.  
NEWMAN: What the hell was that?  
KRAMER: Double bugger!    
NEWMAN:  Yes, you're once. Twice. Three times...  
NEWMAN: Aaah! Aaagh! Aah-aah. Oh, oh the humanity! Aaagh!    
KRAMER: Hey buddy. What're you doing out here?  
KRAMER: Man, did you see that fireball? Woo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo.  
KRAMER: Hey, I gotta skedaddle. You wanna lift?   
KRAMER: Newman! Newman!!  
KRAMER: Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
