Frank: I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward. 
Estelle: That's as far as it goes. 
Frank: There's a mechanism. You just pull it, and throw your body weight. 
Estelle: I pulled it. It doesn't go. 
Frank: If you want the leg room, say you want the leg room! Don't blame  the mechanism! 
George: All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit  sideways. 
Frank: Like an animal. Because of her, I have to sit here like an animal!  Serenity now! Serenity now! 
George: What is that? 
Frank: Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets  too high, the man on the tape tells me to say, 'Serenity now!' 
George: Are you supposed to yell it? 
Frank: The man on the tape wasn't specific. 
George: What happened to the screen door? It blew off again? 
Estelle: I told you to fix that thing. 
Frank: Serenity nowww!       
Patty: So I told Bobby and Lisa that we'd try the new Chinese Spanish  place La Caridad on Saturday. 
Jerry: Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener. 
Patty: Well I thought this would be more fun so I gave the tickets away. 
Jerry: What? All right, fine. 
Patty: Are you mad at me? 
Jerry: No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is. 
Patty: You know... I've never seen you mad. 
Jerry: I get peeved. 
Patty: Mad. 
Jerry: Miffed. 
Patty: *Mad*. 
Jerry: Irked? 
Patty: I'd like to see you get *really* mad.    
George: Why does she want you to be mad? 
Jerry: She says I suppress my emotions. 
George: So what do you care what she thinks. 
Jerry: Good body. 
George: She probably gets that impression because you're cool.  You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that. 
Jerry: But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell. 
George: Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic  pitch.  
Kramer: Hey. 
Jerry: Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food.  Now shut that door and get the hell out of here! 
Kramer:  What is that, a new bit? 
George: I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix  my father's screen door in Queens? 
Jerry: Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx. 
Kramer: I'll do it. 
George: Really? You wanna come? 
Kramer: Yeah, I love going to the country. 
Elaine: Where are they goin'? 
Jerry: Fix a screen door in Queens. 
Elaine:  That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday  night? 
Jerry: Not goin' to the Knick game. 
Elaine: I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah. 
Jerry: You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You  should be able to buy a cheaper gift. 
Elaine:  Oh, I don't think that's possible.    
Kramer:  Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen  door.  Perfect. 
George: Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind keeps  blowing the door off. 
Estelle: I hate that old door. Throw it out! 
Frank: Serenity now! 
Kramer: It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked  hard for ya. 
Frank: Will you put her to rest for me? 
Kramer: Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her.     
Estelle:  Get George to put those boxes in the  garage. 
George: Dad, what's all this? 
Estelle:  It's junk. 
Frank: My computers. I've been selling them for two months now. Shut up! 
George: You're selling computers? 
Frank: Two months ago, I saw a provocative movie on cable TV. It was  called The Net, with that girl from the bus. I did a little reading,  and I realize, it wasn't that farfetched. 
George: Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and  IBM? 
Frank: Yes, I do. That's why I got a secret weapon... my son.    
Jerry: Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk! 
Patty: I think they have 1% over there. 
Jerry: 1 of my ass! 
Patty: OK, Jerry, enough. I'm not buying it. 
Jerry: You're damn right you're not buying it! 
Patty: You shouldn't have to try. It's just being open. 
Jerry: I'm open. There's just nothing in there. 
Patty: Sarcastically) Uh huh. 
Jerry: Oh, you think I'm lying about this? 
Patty: I think you are. 
Jerry: Well, I'm not. 
Patty: Yes, you are, liar. 
Jerry: Oh, stop it. 
Patty: OK, liar. 
Jerry: That's enough! 
Patty: Ooh, that was good. 
Jerry: Really? It felt good.    
Elaine: Congratulations, Mr. Lippman. 
Lippman: Oh, Elaine. My boy's a man today. Can you believe it? He's  a man. 
Elaine: Oh, congratulations, Adam.  
Adam: I'm a man!    
Jerry: Tongue? 
Elaine: Yeah. 
George: Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23. 
Jerry: Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man. 
Elaine: And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six  more Bar Mitzvahs.  
Jerry: Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to  stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you  should thank me. Goodbye.  Hey, I'm flyin' first class. 
Elaine: Where did that come from? 
Jerry: Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that? 
Elaine: No. 
Jerry: Good. 
George: All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's  garage, help him sell some computers. 
Jerry: What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel cage  death match.    
George: Kramer. 
Kramer: Yeah. 
George: What-what are you doing? 
Kramer: Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a  little life in her yet. 
Jerry: What do you need it for? 
Kramer:  The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see  how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.    
George: Morning, ma. 
Estelle:  You're late! 
George: Morning, dad. 
Frank: I'm not 'dad' in the workplace. My professional name is Mr.  Costanza, and I will refer to you as 'Costanza'. Morning, Braun.  Lloyd :  Morning, George. Two cream, no sugar. 
George: What is Lloyd Braun doing here? 
Frank: Your mother recommended him. 
George: Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up  is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a  mental institution? 
Frank: I didn't read his resume.    
Braun:  Another sale, Mr. Costanza. Chalk me up on  the big board. 
George:  What is this?  Frank  This is your lagging. Good  work, Braun.  Estelle  Good for you, Lloyd!    
Elaine: So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology  accepted. 
Adam: I'm not apologizing. It was great. I told everyone. 
Elaine: Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and  tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday. 
Adam: Are you free Friday night? 
Elaine: I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am  in my early... 20s. 
Adam: But I'm a man. The rabbi said so. 
Elaine: No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a  man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet. 
Adam: Well, if I'm not a man, then this whole thing was a sham! First,  they said I was gonna get great gifts, and then, somebody gives me  Boggle. I renounce my religion! 
Lippman: Who wants cookies? 
Adam: As of this moment, I am no longer Jewish. I quit! 
Lippman: What? 
Elaine:  Walnuts, mmmmmm.    
Frank: You're late again, Costanza, so listen up. Starting tonight, we're  having a little sales contest. The loser gets fired, the winner  gets a Waterpik. 
Estelle:  You're not giving away our Waterpik! 
Frank: Serenity now! 
George: You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit! 
Frank: I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with Lloyd  Braun!  
George: You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell  computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why  not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you!   Serenity now!    
Elaine: Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your  father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of  varying success. And these are things I look for in a man. 
Adam:  Well, that does me a lot of  good. 'Early 20s'! 
Elaine: Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried. 
Lippman: So, that's the type of guy you're looking for? 
Elaine: Uhh. I guess so. Why?     
Patty:  What is this? 
Jerry:  Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer  home? Oh, hey. 
Kramer:  Hello, neighbor. 
Jerry: Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely. 
Kramer: Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to. 
Jerry: You barbecuing tonight? 
Kramer:  Right after the fireworks.    
Jerry: So, where do you want to eat tonight? 
Patty: How about La Caridad again? 
Jerry: Again!? How much flan can a person eat!? 
Patty: Jerry, you've been yelling at me all afternoon. 
Jerry: Well, I don't think more flan is the answer! 
Patty: Maybe I should just leave. 
Jerry: 'Maybe'!? 
Patty: Good-bye! 
Jerry: Double good-bye!  
Kramer: Hey, buddy! 
Elaine:  Hey. Happy New Year!  Kramer  Y'all come back reeeaall... 
Elaine: Did you and Patty just break up? 
Jerry: Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about  it! 
Elaine: Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard  about this great place called La Caridad. 
Jerry: That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also,  but I wasn't in the mood. 
Elaine: Whoa. What is the matter? 
Jerry: It's Patty. 
Elaine: Jerry, you break up with a girl every week. 
Jerry:  What--what is this salty discharge? 
Elaine: Oh my God. You're crying. 
Jerry: This is horrible! I care!    
Jerry: Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her. 
Kramer: She's really gotten to you, hasn't she? 
Jerry: I don't know what's happening to me. 
Kramer: Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come  with it. It's like Endora's box. 
Jerry: That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora. 
Kramer: Yeah, well, she... had one, too.  
George: Jerry, can I talk to you for a second?  
Kramer:  That's it, that's it! I  warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house.  This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either!    
George:  Are you still down in  the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick. 
Jerry: You ever heard of a little thing called feelings? 
George: Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer!  Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes. 
Jerry: Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever  tell you how much I love you? 
George: What? 
Jerry: I love you, George. Come here. 
George: I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what?  If you want a computer, call me. I-I gotta go. 
Jerry: Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.    
Kramer: Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back  for two seconds, and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see  you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that house I put under your  sink? 
Jerry: Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer! 
Kramer: I love you, too, buddy, and George-- 
George: I don't want to hear it, Kramer! 
Kramer: Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this  water on full blast. 
George: What signal? What-what signal? 
Kramer: I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!' 
George: If I do it, will you buy a computer? 
Kramer: On the signal, George. On the signal. 
George: Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale. 
Jerry: I love you, Costanza. 
George: Will you shut up?! 
Kramer: Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the  faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa!    
Elaine: So now the *other* Lippman kissed me. 
George: Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa. 
Elaine: What? 
George: It means a non-Jewish woman. 
Elaine: I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to  do with it? 
George: You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of  meeting a woman that's not like their mother. 
Elaine: Oh, that's insane. 
George: I'll tell you what's insane: the price that I could get you  on a new desktop computer. 
Elaine: I am not buying a computer from you. 
George: There's porn. 
Elaine:  Even so. 
George: Damn it!    
Elaine: Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that  you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason  you like me is because I'm a shiksa. 
Lippman: That's simply not true. 
Elaine: If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me. 
Lippman: You are wrong. I'll prove it. 
Elaine: Oh, no. Don't! 
Lippman: I renounce Judaism! 
Elaine: Oy vey!    
Jerry: What happened to you, pal? 
Kramer: Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They  ambushed me with a box of 'Grade A's. 
Jerry: Are you all right? 
Kramer: Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now. 
Jerry: So, you're using Frank's relaxation method?  Kramer  Jerry, the anger, it just melts  right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now!  Elaine  Hey, what happened to you? 
Kramer: Serenity!  
Elaine: Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is  renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is  *with* you people? What are you looking at? 
Jerry: Sit down, Elaine. 
Elaine: Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing. 
Jerry: I've been thinking about what it means to be complete. 
Elaine: Do you have an apple or anything? 
Jerry: Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble. 
Elaine: Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine. 
Jerry: Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning... 
Elaine: Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana! 
Jerry: When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in  front of us! 
Elaine: What? 
Jerry: Elaine... 
George:  Jerry,  I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I  store 'em in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring 'em all  back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's  wrong with your leg? 
Jerry: I'm asking Elaine to marry me.  George  I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment. 
Jerry: Elaine? 
Elaine: Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman  right now. 
Jerry: Lippman?  Elaine  Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh,  yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand.  Come on! Come on! 
Jerry: Can I help you? 
Elaine: No. Stay! Stay. Stay.    
Frank: Hey, Braun, Costanza's kicking your butt!  George  Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay?  Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen? 
Frank: Costanza, you're white hot! 
Phone: If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and-- 
Frank: Hey, Braun, I got good news and bad news. And they're both the 
same: you're fired. Costanza, you've won the water pik! 
Estelle: You're not gonna give away that water pik! 
Frank: You wanna bet? Serenity now, serenity now! 
Lloyd: You know, you should tell your dad that 'serenity now' thing  doesn't work. It just bottles up the anger, and eventually, you  blow. 
George: What do you know? You were in the nut house. 
Lloyd: What do you think put me there? 
George: I heard they found a family in your freezer 
Lloyd: Serenity now. Insanity later.    
Jerry:  What happened here,  Kramer? 
Kramer: Serenity now, serenity now... 
Jerry: Kramer! 
Kramer: Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children,  they've done sum redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now. 
Jerry: You don't look well. 
Kramer: Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the  world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now. 
Jerry: Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.  Kramer  Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about  it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment.  Serenity nooooooooww! 
George: Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun! 
Kramer:  Serenity now! 
George: Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers? 
Kramer:  Serenity nooooowwwww!    
George: Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls  to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five*  computers? 
Kramer:  George, you listen to me. I owe ya one. 
Jerry: He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it? 
George: Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle  it. 
Jerry: George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done.  Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making  shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you? 
George: All right... here goes...    
Elaine: Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this  Shiks-appeal? 
Rabbi: Ha! Elaine, shiks-appeal is a myth, like the Yeti, or his North  American cousin, the Sasquatch. 
Elaine: Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied  Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop. 
Rabbi: Elaine, there's much you don't understand about the Jewish  religion. For example, did you know that rabbis are allowed to date? 
Elaine:  Well, what does that have to do...? 
Rabbi: You know, a member of my congregation has a timeshare in Myrtle  Beach. Perhaps, if you're not too busy, we could wing on down after  the High Holidays? Elaine? 'Lainie?    
George: So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm  capable of. That's me. 
Jerry: Yikes. Well, good luck with all that. 
George: Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a  little compassion. 
Jerry: I think you scared me straight. 
Elaine: All right, Jerome, I'm in. 
Jerry: What? 
Elaine: Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is  right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it. 
Jerry: I tell ya, I don't see it happening. 
Elaine: What? What happened to the new Jerry? 
Jerry: He doesn't work here anymore. 
Elaine: Oh, well that's just *great!* 
George: I love you, Jerry.  Jerry  Right back at ya, Slick. 
George: You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the  two of you get back together. 
Elaine: Well, that's because you're an idiot.    
Frank: You single-handedly brought Costanza and Son to the brink of  bankruptcy. 
George: Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales? 
Frank: He's crazy. His phone wasn't even hooked up. He just liked ringing  that bell. 
Estelle: I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car  in! 
Frank: This is a place of business. I told you never to come in here.  Serenity now! 
Estelle: All right... 
George: Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff. 
Frank: So, what am I supposed to say? 
George: 'Hoochie mama'? 
Estelle: Move your crap, I'm comin' in! 
Frank: No you're not! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama!
