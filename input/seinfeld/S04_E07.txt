JERRY: Well this is it. 
P: This is nice. Thanks again for the Chinese food. 
JERRY: Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic. 
P: Yeah, me too, 
JERRY: No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. 
P: Laughs - ha ha ha . Oh, you know what? I think Naked  gun is on. I've seen it. I  laughed through that whole thing. You wanna watch? 
JERRY: No, I mean, I don't think so. 
P: I thought you liked to laugh. I thought you uwere happy go lucky. 
JERRY: No, nah, I'm not happy and I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything  I'm sad stop unlucky. 
N: ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
JERRY: That's not funny Naiomi. I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you  check the TV guide. I think uh, Holacost is on. 
GEORGE:  Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set foe the week end.  This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi.  All right, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?  AAnyway, i was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know...   
JERRY: This thing has never worked right. 
N: You think I laugh like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer? 
JERRY: Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of  all time. "I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... ha ha " Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the  healthiest ways ...  it makes the juice ... extracts the pulp and the vitamins, for long life  and vitality.   
JERRY: How could you leave a mesage like that on my machine.? 
GEORGE: Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody? 
JERRY: Because I didn't think anyone would leave it! 
GEORGE: Well, I didn't think anyone would play it. 
JERRY: Well, now she's not going away for this weekend. 
GEORGE: What do you mean not goin'? We got plans here. Call her up. 
JERRY: Well, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a  girl with a laugh like that? It's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger.  Cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish mongers a pretty bad smell. 
GEORGE: Well maybe you should ask Elaine. 
JERRY: Yeah but if I ask Elaine, Kramer will feel slighted. 
GEORGE: Oh no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her. 
JERRY: Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?   
JERRY: Ah, Kramer. 
KRAMER: Hello boys, top of the morning to ya. What do you say? What do ya be?

KRAMER: Because I'm going to e playing golf at the Westchester country club. Hum. 
JERRY: Westchester? Isn't that a private club? 
KRAMER: Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St.  and I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round then he says anytime I lay one of  these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Isn't that beautiful. 
JERRY: and GEORGE: ye, hu, um ye,

JERRY: A bubble? 
ELAINE: A bubble? 
MEL: Yes, a bubble! 
MEL: Do you mind? May I? 
ELAINE: Oh, sure.

MEL: No, it's clear. 
JERRY: Ah ha. 
ELAINE: Who has the remote? 
MEL: He does. 
ELAINE: The remote goes through the bubble? 
MEL: Yeah, he's in the bubble with the remote. 
JERRY: So you have no control over the remote? 
MEL: No, it's frustrating. 
ELAINE: Yeah, of course, yeah. 
MEL: So anyway, you're his favourite comedian. he laughed so hard the other night we had to give him an extra shot  of hemoglobin. 
JERRY: That's nice! 
MEL: Tomorrow is his birthday and it would mean so much to him if you could find it in your heart ta' pay him a visit  and just say hello.

JERRY: No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room. 
SUSAN: Oh, 
GEORGE: What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic? 
JERRY: That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. anyway what can I do I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow.  It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin.
