JERRY: Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella,  something boring to read on the plane.   That's it. Done! 
ELAINE:   That is the single greatest packing  performance I have ever seen. 
JERRY:   I am...the master packer. 
ELAINE:   Yeah, right, you're the master packer. 
JERRY: What you must understand, Elaine,   packing is no different than leading men into 
battle: you've gotta know the strengths and weaknesses   of every soldier in  that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of  ordinary black socks. 
ELAINE: 'Scuse me...master packer! 
JERRY: ...Yes. 
ELAINE: Just gimme your keys. 
JERRY: Alright, sir.   George? 
GEORGE:   Yeah 
ELAINE:   OK, so, now, is there anything  else I need to know 'bout this place? 
JERRY: uh, yeah, the uuhh, hot water takes a little while to  come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all  your shopping, you...come back and take a shower. 
ELAINE: OK, this is quite a place. 
JERRY: There's more, the refrigerator.    And I cannot overstate this no soft cheeses of any kind. Is  that clear? 
ELAINE: I'll eat out. 
JERRY: One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity  strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a  big favour do it in the tub. 
GEORGE:   Ready? 
JERRY: Yeah, one sec. 
GEORGE:   Hey, Elaine 
ELAINE: Hi. 
GEORGE: Coming to the airport with us? 
ELAINE: No, I'm staying here for the weekend. I'm getting a  break from my roommate. 
GEORGE: Oh, the actress-waitress. 
ELAINE: No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in  some dinner-theater production of a Chorus Line. So, now all day  long she's walking around the apartment singing    "God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it". She's gonna get it  right in her... 
GEORGE: You just kick her out. 
ELAINE: She's on the lease!...George you have got to find an  other place for me. 
GEORGE: Yeah, well...a little ruff finding something good in  your price-range.   But you, my friend, may be in luck. 
JERRY: I'm not looking. 
GEORGE: No no no, this one's different, this one's a beauty! 
JERRY: Yeah, what's it like? 
GEORGE: I haven't seen it yet, but it's a "two-bedroom", it's  on the uh, west 83rd, 'bout a half block from the park? 
JERRY: How much? 
GEORGE: Uh, twice what you pay in here, but it's a great  building, it's two bedrooms! 
JERRY: Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough  trouble maintaining activity in one.   I saw that. 
ELAINE: You oughtta least take a look at it. 
JERRY: Really? Why? 
ELAINE: 'Cause then I could move in here. 
JERRY: Ooohhhh 
ELAINE: It's time you got out a here anyway. 
GEORGE: Yeah, tell'm, but quickly, I'm double parked here. 
ELAINE: Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have  no hot water, you can't have soft cheese... 
GEORGE: Let's not forget the radiator, the steam has been on  here for ten years; no human can turn this off. 
ELAINE: Jerry, come on, you're doin' OK now, you should at  least take a look at this place. You shouldn't have to live  like this. 
JERRY: Like this? You just said, you wanted to live here. 
ELAINE: Well, for me it's a step up. It's like moving from  Island to Finland. 
GEORGE: Jerry, what do ya...you wanna...you wanna see the  place or not? 
JERRY: I can't think about it now. Come on, I'm going to  Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.       
JERRY: Elaine!   
JERRY:   ELAINE! 
ELAINE:    Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows? 
JERRY: Great, I had fun, where's the TV, where's the VCR.    What? 
ELAINE: They were stolen. 
JERRY: Stolen? When? 
ELAINE: A couple a hours ago, the police are coming right  over. 
JERRY: Stolen? 
ELAINE:   
JERRY:   You left the door open?! 
KRAMER: Uh, Jer, well ya know, I was cookin' and I, I uh, I  came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, 'cause  I was gonna bring the spatula right back! 
JERRY: Wait, you left the lock open or the door open? 
KRAMER:   The door. 
JERRY: The door? You left the door open? 
KRAMER: Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back. 
JERRY: Yeah, and? 
KRAMER: Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera...  The Bold and the Beautiful 
JERRY: So the door was wide open? 
KRAMER: Wide open! 
JERRY:   And where were you? 
ELAINE: I was at Bloomingdale's...waiting for the shower to  heat up. 
KRAMER: Look, Jerry, I'm sorry, I'm uh, you have insurance,  right buddy? 
JERRY: No. 
KRAMER:   How can you not have insurance? 
JERRY: Because...I spent my money on the Clapgo D. 29, it's  the most impenetrable lock on the market today...it has only  one design flaw the door...  must be CLOSED. 
Kramer: Jerry! I'm gonna find your stuff. I'm gonna solve it,  I'm on the case, buddy, I'm on the case! 
JERRY: Yeah, don't investigate, don't pay me back, it was an  accident. 
KRAMER:   I made a mistake. 
ELAINE:   These things happen 
KRAMER:   I'm human 
JERRY: In your way.    
POLICEMAN: Let's see, that's uh, one TV, a stereo, one leather  jacket, a VCR and a computer...is that 'bout it? 
ELAINE: Answering machine. 
JERRY:   Answering machine. Oh, I hate the idea  of somebody out there returning my calls. 
POLICEMAN: What do ya mean? 
JERRY: It's a joke. 
POLICEMAN: I see...Well, mister Seinfeld uh, we'll look into  it and uh, we'll let you know if we uh, you know, if we find  anything. 
JERRY: You ever find anything? 
POLICEMAN: No.   
JERRY: Well, thanks anyway. 
POLICEMAN: You bet. 
ELAINE:    I didn't get that joke either. 
JERRY: The crook has the machine. The messages aren't for him.  He's the crook: why would he answer...  How did you get in here? 
GEORGE:   I walked in, your lobby  door is broken again. 
JERRY: Again. 
GEORGE: I don't know how you put up with this. 
ELAINE: Yeah, tell'm George. 
JERRY:   You would still wanna move in here? 
ELAINE: Yes! You don't understand. I'm living with Ethel  Merman without the talent. 
JERRY:   
JERRY: I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now,  the first couple a times you go through it, it's very  upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will 
say: "Call the police. You really should call the police." So  you think to yourself, ya know, you watch TV, you think:  "Yeah, I'm calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts...I'm gonna  see some real action." Right, you think that. So, the police  come over to your house...they fill out the report...they  give you your copy. Now...unless they give the crook his  copy, I don't really think we're gonna crack this case, do  you?...It's not like Batman, where there's three crooks in the  city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few  crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for  their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot.  "Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin...I think we can  round him up, he's dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him,  he's a PENGUIN!       
ELAINE:   
GEORGE: I didn't know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, this  is incredible. 
JERRY: How do you get all that wood in here? 
ELAINE: They deliver it. 
JERRY: They deliver wood? 
ELAINE: Yeah. 
JERRY: Whatta ya tip a "wood guy"? 
GEORGE:   I didn't know there was a fireplace? 
ELAINE: Look! Look at...look at this! There's a garden. 
GEORGE: A garden! I can't believe there's a garden! 
JERRY: Would I have to get a gardener? 
ELAINE: Yeah, you can get a gardener. 
JERRY: You tip him? 
ELAINE: You can. 
GEORGE:   You don't tip a gardener! 
ELAINE: You can tip a gardener. 
GEORGE: You don't need a gardener. 
ELAINE: Jerry, you can barbecue back here  . 
JERRY: They deliver the coal? 
ELAINE: Sure, it's...probably the same guy, who delivers the  wood. 
JERRY: Oh, than I gotta tip him. 
ELAINE: Oh damn, this place is incredible, look at all this  great light! 
JERRY: I don't have any plants. 
GEORGE: I have plants. 
ELAINE: Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! I'm walking  in it!   It's a "walk-in". Can you believe  it? I'm nuts about this, what do you think?! 
JERRY:    What do ya think, George? 
GEORGE: It's your decision. 
JERRY:    I'm takin' it, I'm takin' the place, I'm gonna take it, this  is gonna be my new place, I'm livin' here...I'm movin'. 
ELAINE:   isn't that  incredible! 
GEORGE: Congratulations.   
ELAINE: What about the couch? 
JERRY: You like the couch? I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. 
ELAINE: What? 
JERRY: You're movin' in, you're a good friend, I wanna start  you off on the right foot. Give me...$150 dollars.   Get it out a  here right now, take it out the door, I don't even wanna see  it, go, get it out. 
ELAINE: A $150 dollars? A $150 dollars for what? For this  couch? 
JERRY: Yeah! 
ELAINE: For this couch?! 
JERRY:   OK, you tell me, what is it worth? 
ELAINE: OK, uuhh...I'll tell you what...I could go as high as  uh...   I don't know, maybe...$20  dollars? 
JERRY:    Yeah? 
GEORGE:   Yeah, it's George. 
JERRY: Come on up.   I'm just gonna pack up the cushions  right now... 
ELAINE: OK ok ok ok, you win $40 dollars. 
JERRY: You wanna get the other end, 'cause I wanna get it in  the hall.   
ELAINE: $50 dollars, OK? $50 dollars, is that all right? 
JERRY: $50 dollars? 
ELAINE: Uh-huh. 
JERRY: Thank you very much. 
ELAINE: Thank you very much. 
GEORGE:   Hey, what's goin' on? 
ELAINE: I just bought Jerry's couch for $50 dollars. 
JERRY:   All  right, ghee, three years, that kinda seems like a long time. 
GEORGE: Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry  ,  listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at  all, at all: do not feel like you have to take it. 
JERRY: Why? 
GEORGE: If you're having second thoughts, if you didn't want  it,  don't worry about it because uh, ya know, I, I...I could take  it, ya know.   
JERRY: You could take it? You want it? 
GEORGE: No, I don't want it. I want it, if you don't want it. 
JERRY: So you do want it. 
GEORGE: No I, I want it if you don't want it! 
JERRY: You just said, you wanted it! 
GEORGE: No, I'm saying, if a situation arose in which you  didn't want it, I might take it. 
JERRY:   So take it. 
GEORGE:   How can I take it?! 
JERRY: How can I take it? 
GEORGE: It's your apartment! 
JERRY: How can I want it now, if you want it? 
ELAINE: Excuse me, uuhh, I don't mean to cause any trouble  here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place? 
GEORGE: Yes, but I am not taking it. 
JERRY: I...am not taking it.   
ELAINE: Well, one of you better damn well take it! 
JERRY: Well, whatta you wanna do here? 
GEORGE: I, I don't know.   
JERRY: Do you wanna flip a coin? 
GEORGE: ...Who flips?...You'll flip, I'll call. 
JERRY: OK, fine...  This is the  official flip! No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and  that's it, agreed? 
GEORGE: I'm good. 
ELAINE: I don't know, who to rune for, George's place has  carpeting. 
JERRY: All right, now you call it in the air. 
GEORGE: No catchin'. 
JERRY: No no. 
GEORGE: Flip it.   
JERRY: Tails! 
GEORGE: No, it hit the table, it hit the table. 
JERRY: So what? 
GEORGE: INTERFERENCE! YOU CAN'T COUNT THAT. COME ON, ARE YOU  CRAZY?!! THE COIN CAN NOT TOUCH ANYTHING, it affects it. 
JERRY: You didn't call no interference! 
GEORGE: YOU DON'T HAVE TO CALL THAT. THAT'S A RULE!! 
JERRY: I don't believe this. 
GEORGE: Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it,  just take it! 
JERRY: I don't wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do ya  think? 
ELAINE: I'd better not... 
JERRY: ...Well, I'll tell ya what I'll choose you for it.  Straight choose, three takes it, no disputes...that's it, you  gotta win three. 
GEORGE: OK  ...OK. I'll choose  you...whatta ya want?

BOTH:   Once, twice, three,  shoot! 
GEORGE: Mine! 
BOTH: Once, twice, three, shoot! 
GEORGE:    Congratulations...congratulations. 
JERRY: Thanks.   
GEORGE:   WHAT DID I PUT UP TO? WHAT DID  I PUT UP TO? 
KRAMER:   Jerry, I think  I'm on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the  Englishman, who lives down the hall? 
JERRY: Yeah. 
KRAMER: The last couple a days he's been acting very strange;  I think he's avoiding me. 
JERRY: Hard to imagine.   
KRAMER: Yeah! And get this I just got of the elevator with  him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I  said to him, like I, I was like this  , I went "Oh, by the way, I now about the  stuff." 
JERRY: Right. 
KRAMER: Ya know, very casually, so that he was gonna take me  in to his confidence. 
ELAINE: So what did he say? 
KRAMER: "What stuff?". 
JERRY: Ooh, case closed!   
KRAMER: No, you don't understand, you see, he swallowed...see,  the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something!  Now, I'm gonna go over there, I'm gonna borrow some tee...if I  don't get back in five minutes, maybe you'd better call the  police. 
JERRY: OK, starting  ...NOW! 
KRAMER: Yeah!   
JERRY: One of the problems in life is that when you're a kid,  you have a certain way of working out disagreements...and  those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main way  that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them 
say: "I got the front seat"   
GEORGE:   I don't know if it's the tile or  the lighting...I feel like Robert Wagner. 
JERRY:   So, what are ya gettin'? 
GEORGE: I don't know, I can't eat, ya, ya can't have anything  anymore. Look at this, look at this eggs out, coffee out,  french fries out, BLT out!...I go to visit my grandparents  three big brisket sandwiches, I'm sittin' here with a carrot!  They're closing in on a hundred, I'm sayin' to them "How can  you eat that stuff?!"...  I'm  so sick about losin' that choose, you don't know. 
JERRY: Oh, right, forget it, forget it, I'm not taking the  place! 
GEORGE: What?! 
JERRY: How can I live there? 
GEORGE: Why not?! 
JERRY: Look at you, you're still thinking about it, I'll never  feel comfortable. 
GEORGE: Oh, get out a here. 
JERRY: How can I ever have you over? You'll sit there moping. 
GEORGE: Mope? 
JERRY: You're already moping!...Would you take the place? 
GEORGE: No, impossible! It's your apartment. 
JERRY: You found the place. 
GEORGE: You won the choose. 
JERRY: All right, forget it, it's over, I'm not moving. 
GEORGE: Well, me neither. 
JERRY: Definitely? 
GEORGE: Definitely. 
JERRY: Oh, than just get rid of it. You won't have any  problem. 
GEORGE: No, it's not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment  this afternoon.   
WAITRESS: What apartment? 
GEORGE: Oh, it's a great place, it's uh "two-bedroom" uh, west  83rd 'bout half block from the park. 
WAITRESS: What's the rent?    
GEORGE: I don't know, what we're doin' here, this is  ridiculous. 
JERRY: She wanted to thank us for the apartment.   
ELAINE: I can't believe I lost the deposit on that u-hall.   
JERRY: If only the coin hadn't hit the table. 
GEORGE: The table is interference, you know it! 
JERRY: It is not! 
GEORGE: It is too! 
ELAINE: My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on Carrousel.     
WAITRESS: Hi. 
GEORGE: Hi, Carol. 
CAROL: I just wanted to introduce you to my husband, this is  Larry   These are the guys who got us the apartment. 
LARRY: Oh, you don't know how grateful I am, if there's  anything I can ever do to repay you, I, I mean, we're just so  thrilled with this place. 
CAROL: It's a dream. 
LARRY: I'm running in the park now, I've lost weight, we're  barbecuing every night and the rent is unbelievable. 
GEORGE: We're really glad for ya.   
ELAINE: Couldn't be happier.   
JERRY: It's wonderful.   
CAROL: Diane, Diane, come here.    Diane gave me the greatest backrub today, she's a masseuse! 
DIANE: How, how could you guys have turned this place down,  it's such a great location and it's...so close to the park. 
GEORGE: We're aware of the proximity to the park, yes. 
DIANE: Well, it was nice to meet you.   
GEORGE: Nice meeting you.   
JERRY: How late are the stores open? I'm thinking of maybe uh,  buying a new TV and smash it over my head.    
RIGHT MAN: I get a call from Gilmore this morning and get 
this they're restructuring the organization in Atlanta and I  gotta be there on the first of the month.  
LEFT MAN: Really? What are you gonna 'bout the apartment?  
RIGHT GUY: Well, what can I do? Give it up.  
JERRY, ELAINE and GEORGE: What's the rent?
