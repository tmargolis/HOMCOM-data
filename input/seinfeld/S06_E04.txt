JERRY  Good shave today..  
ELAINE   Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm  fine.  
JERRY  I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little..  
ELAINE  Can we rest here a second.  JERRY   Yeah, I guess.    
JERRY  .. So how's Noreen?  ELAINE  Mm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.  
JERRY  Already? That was fast.. I assume he's not a High Talker..  
ELAINE  No, but, he has, The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he  won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta go through, like, ten minutes of  chit-chat.  
JERRY  A Long Talker.  ELAINE  Yeah! But he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I  just hang up.  
JERRY   All right; let's move it out.    
JERRY  Hey, isn't that George's father?  
ELAINE  Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say hello?  
JERRY  I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.  
ELAINE  That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?  
JERRY  I believe he is wearing a cape.  
ELAINE  Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?  
JERRY  Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.  
ELAINE  Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?  
JERRY  You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of  the street. Cover me.       
JERRY  Just, ah, plop it on the counter there.    
JERRY  Oh! I got a message.   
GEORGE   Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say..   
ELAINE  That sounds Urgent..  
JERRY  Let me call him back..  Hello?? Who is this?  Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.  
ELAINE  Donna Chang?  
JERRY   Should've talked to her; I love Chinese women.  
ELAINE  Isn't that a little racist?  JERRY  If I like their race, how can that be racist?..  Hellooo??..  Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!..  Yyy-yes, I am calling George..  Oh, the lines are crossed; you're getting his calls. Well, what do you  know?!    
JERRY  So listen..  
KRAMER  I'm goin' through this stuff like water..  Who you talkin' to?  
ELAINE  He's on with a Chinese woman.  
KRAMER  Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women.   
ELAINE  You got a.. comfort problem there?  
KRAMER  Yeah, I think these Jockeys shrunk.  
ELAINE  I thought you wore silk underwear.  
KRAMER  No. Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stay  with it. Yeah, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys.  My boys need a house.  
ELAINE   That's nice.  Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't  wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.  
KRAMER  Sperm count?  Well how many ssssperm should I have?  
ELAINE  A lot.    
JERRY  I got a date!  
ELAINE  With the Chinese woman?!  
JERRY  She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever  with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.  
KRAMER  Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?  
JERRY  No, why should I? I wear boxers.  KRAMER  You ever get a woman pregnant?  
JERRY  I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed..  
KRAMER  What would you say if I told you, "I never impregnated a woman"?  
JERRY  Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??..  Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women, I--  
KRAMER  A lot of 'em!   Do you think maybe I'm.. Depleted??!!  
JERRY  Well, I'm sure you're not.. Totally Depleted.  
KRAMER  Well, but what if I am? I'm the last male Kramer! We're facing extinction!  
JERRY  Well, go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.  
KRAMER  Yeah, but then I'd have to.. well, you know.. into a cup? In the middle  of the day??  
ELAINE  Does that conflict with your regular schedule?    
ELAINE    All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.  
JERRY  I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!  
ELAINE  She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?  
JERRY  She suggested it!  
ELAINE  I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese..  
JERRY  She's very assimilated.    
JERRY  Paul again?  
ELAINE   You can't get one ring past him.    
GEORGE  Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!  
JERRY  I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!  
GEORGE  Uh?  
ELAINE   Hey, George, we saw your father on the  street before.  
GEORGE  What's he doin' in the city today?    
GEORGE  You didn't ask him?    
GEORGE  You didn't say hello?  
ELAINE  Well, he was with someone.  A man.. In a cape.  
GEORGE  Why was he wearing a cape?..    
GEORGE  Was my father wearing a cape?  
JERRY  No. Jacket and tie: no cape.  
GEORGE  Huh.. Cape..  W--a man with a cape doin'  with my father?.. What was my father doing with a man in a cape? ..   Why a cape?
DOCTOR  The results of your sperm test are in.  Well, ummm.. Are you planning to start a family?  
KRAMER  Yes! I would like to! Very much!..  Well, I'm low, now, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...  
DOCTOR  Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.  
KRAMER  Ohhh. Man!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to  procreate! I--  
DOCTOR  Hey--that's not necessarily true. There are measures you can take to  improve your fertility.  
KRAMER  All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come  on, Doc, tell me.  DOCTOR  First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.  
KRAMER  All the time?  
DOCTOR  All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.  
KRAMER  Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys. 
ELAINE  Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling!  Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk.  Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!.. Oh. She's not?! Okay, great. Well you can  just tell her I called, then, an'--  Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately..  Oh, okay, well, I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna..   Yeah, I took 20 Paul. The.. car..  seems to be running out of gas. .. I'm gonna.. have to get off the  phone. 
HOSTESS  Just let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir.  
JERRY  Yes, I will.  GUY   Mind?  
JERRY   No--go ahead--I second-hand smoke two packs a day.    
DONNA  Jerry.  
JERRY   'scuse me?  
DONNA  Hi. Sorry I'm late.  
JERRY  Who're you?  
DONNA  I'm Donna Chang..  
JERRY   What do you mean?  
DONNA  I mean: I'm Donna Chang.  
JERRY   You're Donna Chang?  
DONNA  Did you think I was Chinese?..  
JERRY  Oh. No. Oh, you mean because of the "Chang"?  
DONNA  Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.  
JERRY  I didn't think so.  DONNA  It used to be "Changstein."
ELAINE  She's not Chinese?  JERRY  No. Not Chinese.  Not even Asian.  
ELAINE  So. What is she?  
JERRY  Well, she's.. like you.  
ELAINE   Oh, how.. disappointed you must have been.   
JERRY  Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes  people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always  introduces herself as "Donna Chang,"..  
ELAINE  So why're you seeing her again..  
JERRY  Well, she is a woman.  
ELAINE  I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.  
JERRY  Really?  
ELAINE  Well, maybe.  
JERRY   Hey, wouldn't it be funny if  Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?  
ELAINE   What do you mean?  
JERRY  Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy.. hangin' up because he  was having an affair with Noreen?    
KRAMER  Here. Take my Jockey shorts.    
ELAINE  Whoa! Whoa!  
JERRY  What is that?!!  
KRAMER  Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.  
JERRY  Wha--you have a low sperm count?  
KRAMER  Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.  
JERRY  Nnnoo--I don't want 'em.  
KRAMER  Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one  pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!  
JERRY  Look! I don't want 'em!  
KRAMER  All it takes is one pair! Now, come on!  JERRY  I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!    
KRAMER  Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up,  they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flip  pin'! I'm floppin'!    
KRAMER  What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' crazy in these things!   
JERRY   Well. I'm gonna have to  move now.  
FRANK  Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.  
GEORGE  Plenty of mosquitoes.  FRANK  Queens is full of mosquitoes.  
GEORGE  So, Dad..  
FRANK  Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.  
GEORGE  Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!  
FRANK  Your mother has to tell you every move I make!?  
GEORGE  No.. Jerry and Elaine saw you.  
FRANK  They didn't say hello?  
GEORGE  Well, they were in a rush.  
FRANK  They couldn't just say hello?! .. Oh, to hell with them.  
GEORGE  They, uh.. said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape, ha ha.  
FRANK  Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the  word--supercilious.  
GEORGE  So Dad.  FRANK  How could Jerry not say Hello?!!   
JERRY  So did they, uh, uncross the lines, yet?  
DONNA  No. They can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.  
JERRY  --should he say something--can't  decide if he should. finally..] Did you say, "ridicurous"?  
DONNA  Ridiculous.  
JERRY   I thought you said.. "ridicurous."     
JERRY  Oh, what are you doing here?  
GEORGE  Oh, I wanted to,  talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know  you had company.  Hi, uh, I'm George.  
DONNA  Oh! Hi!  I'm Donna Chang.   I just spoke to your mother before.  
GEORGE   You spoke to my mother?  
DONNA  She was trying to call you, but--  
JERRY  The rines were crossed?    
GEORGE  Did you say, "The rines were crossed?"  
JERRY  Did I?  
DONNA   George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!  Anyway, I'm really sorry.  
GEORGE  Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?  
DONNA  Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.       
ELAINE  Divorced. That's really too bad..  
JERRY  Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years  ago. He could have been normal.  
GEORGE   Oh my God! You know what I just realized?! If  they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many  visits!  
JERRY  I never thought of that.  
GEORGE  Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day?  Haha!  It's like runnin' the double marathon!  
ELAINE  Hey George, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?  JERRY  Have you ever spent any time with these people..?  
GEORGE  You know what this has to do with? The man in the cape--I bet you he is  mixed up in this!  I don't trust men in capes.  
JERRY  You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a  cape. .. Superman wore a cape.. An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand  here an' let you say something bad about him.  
GEORGE  All right Superman's the exception.  
ELAINE      
KRAMER  Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I  want you to put in a good word for me.  I've always had a  thing for Noreen.  
ELAINE  Oh, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.  
KRAMER  Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my  fingers this time. Nooope.   
JERRY  Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers..  
KRAMER  Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.  
JERRY  You went back to the Jockeys?  
KRAMER  Wrong again.  
JERRY   Oh, no.  
ELAINE  What? What?..  
JERRY  Don't you see what's goin' on here??? .. No boxers, no Jockeys..  
ELAINE  Eeaawww...  
JERRY  The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine..  
JERRY  Kramer, say it isn't so.  
KRAMER  Oh, it be so.  I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllovin' every minute of it!!!  
JERRY  Don't you need a little.. help?  
KRAMER  Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered..  I'm like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the  countryside!!
ELAINE  Well, you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!..  
NOREEN  Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He just went insane there for a while..  
ELAINE  Oh, he went insane?..  
NOREEN  Believe it or not: Paul was convinced I was having an affair because  somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of  a Sick Person calls and hangs up over and over?  
ELAINE   Well. Uh. I  don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna,  talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always  making, boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that  the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!  
NOREEN   I can't believe  that was you..  
ELAINE   I'm really sorry, Noreen..  
NOREEN   So you thought he was boring?  
ELAINE  Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha ha.  
NOREEN       
JERRY  What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship  you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!  
ELAINE  I know--  
JERRY  First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.  
ELAINE  Well, Jer--I got confused, they sound exactly the same.  
JERRY  So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets: A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're  reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring.  ELAINE   I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.  
JERRY  Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman!  Anything you say she does!    
JERRY  Yeah.  
DONNA  It's Donna Chang.  
JERRY   Come on up.  
ELAINE  Well, I guess I just didn't realize it..  
JERRY  Well, let's look back on your history with this woman. Okay?  
ELAINE  Okay..  
JERRY  First, you encouraged her to join: The Army. .. She did.  
ELAINE  She was lost..  
JERRY Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!  
ELAINE  Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun..  
JERRY  You know.. You better make sure you never tell this woman to jump off  the Brooklyn Bridge..  
ELAINE  If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an'  tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!    
DONNA  Hi.  JERRY  Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..    
DONNA   Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting  divorced.  
JERRY  Why? What happened?  
DONNA  Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for  an hour, she changed her mind!!!  
JERRY  Wow! That's amazing!  
DONNA  Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! She said  you should come too.  
JERRY  Tonight?  
DONNA  Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. 
GEORGE  All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is goin'  to happen. No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings,  you're out of your minds!!!  
ESTELLE   We're not getting divorced.  
FRANK  You mother changed her mind..   
GEORGE   Ya-De! That's Goood! That's Very good! I'm very glad to hear  that.  
FRANK  Yeah. We worked it out.  
GEORGE  All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?  
FRANK  He was my lawyer.  
GEORGE  You lawyer wears a cape..?  
FRANK  Yeah. So what?  
GEORGE  Who wears a cape?  
FRANK  He's very independent; doesn't follow the trends.  
ESTELLE  He looks ridiculous in that thing..  
FRANK  You have no eye for fashion!!!  
ESTELLE  I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!  
GEORGE  All right! Come on!  Let's not fight.  
FRANK and ESTELLE  All right! All right!  
ESTELLE  Georgie's right.  
GEORGE  So what made you change your mind?  
ESTELLE  It was that Chinese woman. 
JERRY  So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?  
DONNA  I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.  
JERRY   Confucius, huh?  DONNA  Yeah.  
JERRY   You know, you're not Chinese... 
JERRY  Hey! I heard the good news!  
FRANK Jerry: how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!  
JERRY  Elaine was.. in a rush.  
FRANK  I knew it was Elaine!!  
DONNA  You must be Estelle.  
ESTELLE  Yes. Who are you..?  
DONNA  I'm Donna Chang!  
ESTELLE  You're not Chinese! 
KRAMER  Hello?  
ELAINE  Paul?  
KRAMER  Elaine!  
ELAINE  Kramer?  
KRAMER   Yeahh!  
ELAINE  What're you doin' there?  
KRAMER  Wellll, isn't it obvious?  
ELAINE  Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?  
KRAMER  Yes, she is..  
ELAINE  Well? Can I talk to her?  
KRAMER  What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?  
ELAINE   Fine--would you just put her on?  
KRAMER  Well, I feel it'd be best if you just didn't talk to her for a while..  
ELAINE  You feel?  
KRAMER  That's right!  She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the  destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years..  ELAINE  What are you insane?!  KRAMER  From now, on, I'll be calling the shots around here..  
ELAINE  Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna tell her?  
KRAMER  Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army..  There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now..  And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do..  
ELAINE  Uh! Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!  
KRAMER  Can't help ya, kid. 
ESTELLE  You're not Chinese!?!?  
DONNA   No.  
ESTELLE  I thought you were Chinese!!  
DONNA  I'm from Long Island.  
ESTELLE  Long Island?!?!  I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!  
DONNA  I'm sorry..?  
ESTELLE  Well! Then, that changes everything!  
GEORGE  What?!  
ESTELLE  She's not Chinese; I was duped!!  
GEORGE  So what?! She gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!  
ESTELLE  I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!!   
GEORGE   Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because  she's from Long Island?!?!  
FRANK   You want a  divorce?!!? You got one!!!  
JERRY   You know, you might wanna think about changin' your  name..
ELAINE  So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!  
JERRY  Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the  Chinese.  
ELAINE   You know, everybody listens to the Chinese.  I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in  any other restaurant.  
JERRY   Yeah, no one's reading  any rolled-up messages in a knish..    
GEORGE  Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!  
JERRY  Hey.  
GEORGE  I predicted it!   Saw both of them today!  What a disaster!  I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch  together. Never had, Lunch, with my mother before--it's like a date!  Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We  played "Clue"! All day with this!   
KRAMER  Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late!  She's laaate!!  
NOREEN  Who are you?!  
MAN   I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. .
