ELLEN: So, they have this clock now, where you punch in your age, and all your risk factors. It actually counts down how much time you have left to live. 
JERRY: So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you this thing was good! 
ELLEN:  I can't believe this is our first date. 
JERRY: I know.. How about dessert? 
ELLEN: I suppose I have to get a piece of cake.. 
JERRY: Why? 
ELLEN: Today's my birthday. 
JERRY: What? Today? Really? 
ELLEN: Yeah.       
GEORGE: So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was her birthday? 
JERRY: Yeah. And she picked the day! 
GEORGE: Is she socially awkward? 
JERRY: No, she's great! She's.. attractive, she's fun.. 
GEORGE: Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the Monday after the weekend. 
JERRY: She's not Lincoln.   
KRAMER: Hey! Anybody up for Lorenzo's pizza? 
JERRY: I'll pass. 
KRAMER: Oh, yeah? Huh.  Hey, George! Pizza? Yum, yum! 
GEORGE: Eh, I can't. I gotta go down to the foundation. I'm interviewing high schoolers for the Susan Ross.. scholarship. 
JERRY: Does it ever bother you that this organization- 
GEORGE: Nope! 
JERRY: is beating the bushes- 
GEORGE: Nope!  
JERRY: to basically give this money away- 
GEORGE: Noo! 
JERRY: to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you? 
GEORGE:  I'm fine with it! Fi-hi-hi-hine I say!       
STUDENT 1: And then I received a 740 on the English achievement test.  
GEORGE: Quick, what's your favorite animal?  
STUDENT 1: I.. I don't know.. frog? 
GEORGE:  A frog?  STUDENT 1: Well, I.. I.. 
GEORGE:  Frog is wrong.   
GEORGE:  I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? It'd save you a lot of trouble.  
STUDENT 2: Well, the modern-day harp has been refined over thousands of years- 
GEORGE:  Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know.   
GEORGE:  I see your G.P.A's a 4.0.  
STUDENT 3:  You like that, don't you?   
GEORGE: so, uh, Steven.. I see you're president of the chess club. 
STEVEN: State champs. 
GEORGE: Who's your favorite chess player? 
STEVEN:  Nastercoff? 
GEORGE: Right.  Nastercoff.. What country is he from, again? 
STEVEN:  I don't know.. I made it up.  I'm never gonna get this thing. 
GEORGE:  Woah, woah, woah! What are you telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down.   What do you want to do when you grow up? 
STEVEN: I've been telling people that I'd like to be an architect..       
ELAINE: So, get this: Mister Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. He's gonna let me ghost write it. 
JERRY: Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone to ghost read it.   
KRAMER: Hey. 
JERRY: Hey. 
ELAINE: Hey! 
KRAMER: Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice of the fixin's bar.. garlic,  and what-not.. mmm,  mmm.. and I see this guy over at the pizza boxes giving me the stink-eye.  So I give hime the crook-eye back,  you  know.. Then, I notice that he's not alone! I'm taking on the entire Van Buren Boys! 
JERRY: The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren? 
KRAMER: Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know,  they block it! So, I lunged for the bathroom.   I grab the knob - Occupado! Then they back me up agains the cartoon map of Italy, and all of the sudden, they just stop. 
ELAINE: What? What happened? 
KRAMER: Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like this  I'm only showing eight fingers. 
JERRY: Well, what does that mean? 
KRAMER: That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth President..  They thought I was a former Van B. Boy!     
ELLEN:  Oh, Jerry, can you hold on a sec? I just want to check my messages..   Oh, Melissa! Kim! 
MELISSA: Ellen. 
ELLEN: Hey! You guys, I want you to meet Jerry.  
MELISSA: Ohh, we've heard a lot about you!  It is so sweet of you to take her out. 
KIM: Yeah, you don't even know how much she needs this. 
JERRY:  She coming of a bad break-up? 
KIM:  No. 
MELISSA: See ya!   
JERRY: Any messages? 
ELLEN: Yeah, no one called.     
JERRY: They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her. 
GEORGE: So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine.  
JERRY: There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group. 
GEORGE: Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath? 
JERRY: No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can! 
GEORGE:  Hey, I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship. 
JERRY: Yeah? 
GEORGE: I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches T.V.. 
JERRY: Is he smart? 
GEORGE:  He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this: he's into architecture. 
JERRY: Hey! Just like you pretend to be. 
GEORGE: Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry. 
JERRY: I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!     
ELAINE: Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined..  
PETERMAN: Ohhh.. It's just a place to flop.  
ELAINE: Well,  what part of your life  do you want to start with? Foreign  intrigue? Exotic romances? 
PETERMAN: Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that in the catalogue ad nauseum. No, I would like this book to be about my day-to-day life. 
ELAINE: Oh. 
PETERMAN:  Oh damn. They changed the cable stations again.. just when I finally memorized them. 
ELAINE: Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um.. 
PETERMAN:  2.. CBS.. 
ELAINE: get, um, started.. 
PETERMAN: 3.. I don't know what that is.. where's my damn preview channel? 
ELAINE:  Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here. 
PETERMAN: well, I'm sure we'll come up with something. What do you say you and I order ourselves a pie? Do you like Lorenzo's? 
ELAINE: You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys? 
PETERMAN:  You don't say. 
ELAINE: Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign. 
PETERMAN: Well, that's pretty exciting.  Let's put that in the book. 
ELAINE: But, that didn't happen to you. 
PETERMAN: So, we pay off your friend, and it becomes a Peterman. 
ELAINE: No, I - I really don't think you can do that. 
PETERMAN:  Ohh, damn. I forgot to buy plant food again.. I'll bet I got a coupon for it.  
ELAINE: You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.       
JERRY: Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday? 
ELLEN: No, this is brand new. Do you like it? 
JERRY: Actually, yeah.  Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?!  Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?! 
ELLEN:  No, Jerry, the waitress game be another one. 
JERRY: I guess that's all right. 
ELLEN: Is something wrong, Jerry? 
JERRY: No, absolutely nothing.  You're fantastic!  Hey guys! 
GEORGE: Hey. 
JERRY:  Kramer, George, this is Ellen.       
GEORGE: Ladies and gentlemen, this  is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve -  not showing off, not falling behind. 
WYCK: George, the quailifications for this scholarship were suppose to be.. largely academic. 
GEORGE: I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests.. 
WYCK: These aren't standardized tests - these are his grades. 
GEORGE: Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be  an architect. 
WYCK: Is that right? 
STEVEN: Actually, maybe I could set my sights a little bit higher. 
GEORGE:  Steven, nothing is higher than an architect. 
STEVEN: I think I'd really like to be a city planner.  Why limit myself to just one building, when I can design a  whole city? 
WYCK: Well, that's a good point. 
GEORGE:  No, it's not. 
STEVEN: Well, isn't an architect just an art school drop-out with a tilty desk, and a big ruler?  
GEORGE:  It's called a T-square. 
WYCK: You know, the stupidest guy in my fraternity became an architect - after he flunked out of dental school!  Contratulations,  young man.  
STEVEN: Thank you. 
WYCK: Susan would be proud of what you're doing. 
STEVEN: Thank you.       
KRAMER: And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th President, was the man they most admired. 
PETERMAN:  Kramer, my friend, that is one ripping good yarn..  
KRAMER: You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica?  
ELAINE: No, uh, Kramer. I don't think - 
PETERMAN:  How much would you take for the whole lot? 
KRAMER: My whole lot? 
PETERMAN: Name your price, man! 
KRAMER:  1500 dollars. 
PETERMAN: I'll give you half that. 
KRAMER:  Done! 
PETERMAN: Kramer, my friend,  consider Elaine at your disposal. 
KRAMER: Okay..  Well, I, Uh.. I like to work in the evenings..        
ELAINE: Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano story?! 
KRAMER: Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store. 
ELAINE: What happened to Bob Saccamano? 
KRAMER: Well, nothing. His part of the story is done.  So I'm waiting for the  subway, It's not coming, so I decided to hoof it through the tunnel. 
ELAINE: Alright, well, now that's something.. 
KRAMER: Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but the next think I knew.. 
ELAINE:  A train is bearing down on you?! 
KRAMER: No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return. 
ELAINE:  I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning? 
KRAMER: Well, I guess I was.. 
ELAINE:  What were you gonna wear on the way back? 
KRAMER: Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there!  All right, next story.. 
ELAINE: Alright, I think I got enough for one day. 
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, chew on that. 
ELAINE:  Yeah, I'll chew on that. 
KRAMER: Oh, hey, listen, by the way - I'm hosting a little get-together tonight in honor of my little financial upturn.. 
ELAINE: Oh, thanks. I've got plans. 
KRAMER: Elaine, you should be there to document it. 
ELAINE:  Oh, you're getting together with some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes? 
KRAMER: Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple a chance to loosen up.       
JERRY: So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner? 
GEORGE: I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my  father.. my father's father before him. 
JERRY: You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field.  Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. we're all set for the weekend. 
GEORGE: You're spending the weekend with Ellen? 
JERRY:  Vermont!  With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to!  Four days at a beautiful bed-and-breakfast! I can't wait.. buy-bye.  What?  What is this? 
GEORGE:  You want to start? 
KRAMER:  Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get my thoughts together. 
GEORGE: Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough. 
JERRY: What?! 
KRAMER:  Jerry, she's a loser.  
JERRY: Where is this coming from? She's great! 
GEORGE:  Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? Things will pick up. 
JERRY: There's nothing wrong with my career! 
KRAMER:  Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him. 
GEORGE: I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now! 
KRAMER: Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider. 
GEORGE: Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time! 
KRAMER: Listen, George, all these issues are interrelated. 
JERRY:  Alright! Excuse me!  I'm not buying any of this! 
KRAMER: All right, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh, everybody's wrong but you! 
JERRY: You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different! 
KRAMER: Which one? 
JERRY: They were all like that!       
STEVEN: Why'd you take away my scholarship, Mister Costanza? 
GEORGE: Well, Steven, I, uh..  
STEVEN: These are my new friends - The Van Buren Boys.  MEMBER 1: He became so disillusioned, he had to join us. 
GEORGE: Oh.. nice. 
STEVEN: I want my scholarship back, so I can be a city planner. 
GEORGE: What about architect, Steven?  
MEMBER 1:  City planner.        
FRIEND 1: Great party, K-man! 
KRAMER: Yeah, well, you got that straight!  Hey, Elaine, try the beef - because that's realy au jus sauce, huh.  Real au jus sauce! 
ELAINE:  I'll make a note of it.  
FRIEND 1: Hey, Kramer, 
KRAMER: Yeah?  
FRIEND 1: Ramirez has never heard your pants story. 
KRAMER: Ohh kay! Well, you know, I had Bob Saccamano on the phone, and I suddenly realized that I-  
ELAINE: You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman. 
KRAMER: What do ya mean? 
ELAINE: You signed the release. 
KRAMER: Yeah. 
ELAINE: He sat in mud. Not you. 
KRAMER: But I did sit in mud. 
ELAINE:  Ya didn't! You never sat in mud! 
KRAMER:  I was all dirty! 
ELAINE: It ever happened! Understand?   
KRAMER:  Hey, hey, hey! All right! Yeah, uh, yeah.. well.. Uh, the pants. they, uh, they fit, uh, well - and so I, uh, decided I wasn't gonna return them!   Wooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!    FRIEND 1: It's getting late. Maybe we better get going.  
KRAMER: What? You're gonna go now? Hey, woah! I don't..    
KRAMER:  Kramer, Kramer! I got big trouble with the - with the Van Buren Boys. 
KRAMER: Hey, now, they're tough cookies. 
GEORGE: Yeah, and I - I heard you got on their good side. Now, what'd you do? 
KRAMER: Uh.. ah,  Oh, nothing - nothing.. No, I certainly don't have any stories, if that's  what you're implying.  
GEORGE:  Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?! 
KRAMER: Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me, but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind. 
GEORGE: You mean, like, a former member?       
ELAINE: These Kramer stories are unusable!  I mean, some of them aren't even stories!  Look, this is a list of things in his  apartment! 
JERRY: Is my toaster oven on there? 
ELAINE: How am I ever gonna turn this into a book? 
JERRY: Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer. 
ELAINE: Yes! I'm a writer. 
JERRY: Make them interesting. 
ELAINE: Interesting! Of course! People love interesting writing!   
JERRY: Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents. 
ELAINE: What? Wheren't they just here? 
JERRY: Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her. 
ELAINE: Maybe we could all have dinner later? 
JERRY: I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight.   
KRAMER: Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story!  So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch  next to me, but as I'm stacking them up, they keep falling into my foot bath!  
JERRY: Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this! 
KRAMER: Damn! 
JERRY: What? 
KRAMER: Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but they all stink! 
ELAINE: How much did you pay for them? 
KRAMER: Eight bucks! I think I got ripped off!      
ELAINE: Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter? 
PETERMAN: Well, it started out nicely: "I'm returning some pants." A very identifiable problem..  "I set of down a train tunnel."..  But that's  where the story takes a most unappealing turn. 
ELAINE: Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a  whole band of underground tunnel dwellers! 
PETERMAN: It just seems so cliched, and obvious. It's not interesting writing. 
ELAINE: Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your  pants? 
PETERMAN:  The very pants I was returning. That's perfect irony! Elaine, that is interesting writing!  
SECRETARY: I have a Cosmo Kramer on line 4. 
PETERMAN:  Peterman, here. 
KRAMER: Mister Peterson, you gotta sell me my stories back! 
PETERMAN: You want to know something? I no longer need them! 
ELAINE: No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference? 
PETERMAN: Nonsense!  I have Benes' woderfully imaginative mind to spin my stories. You take back your tales, you vagabond! 
KRAMER: Yippie-yi-yay! 
PETERMAN:  There you are, Elaine. Go forth, and create.  And, by the way, when you get to that chapter about my romantic  escapades - feel free to toss yourself in the mix.       
GEORGE: Hey, Van B. Boys. 
STEVEN: So, Mister Costanza, did you get my scholarship back? 
GEORGE: Now, fellas, fellas.. easy. You wouldn't want to beat up on one of your own.  
MEMBER 2: Is that right? Then why don't you flash us the sign? 
GEORGE: Right.. the sign.  
STEVEN: That's not the sign. 
GEORGE:  It was when I was banging!  MEMBER 2: All right, if you really are one of us.. let's see you take the wallet off the next guy who walks by. 
GEORGE: Love to!      
ELLEN: And after college, I got my masters at the Sorbonne. 
MORTY: Sorbonne? Oh, hey.  That's in Paris. 
ELLEN:  Oh, Jerry, you're parking meter's about to expire. Don't get up, I've got change.  
JERRY:  So? What do you think? 
HELEN: Jerry, she's fantastic. 
JERRY: I knew it! I'm not crazy. 
HELEN: She's so sweet, and she's got some body on her! 
MORTY: And smart! Like a computer! 
HELEN: And so much personality! But, it doesn't matter what we think. Do you like her? 
JERRY:  Now, I'm not so sure. 
HELEN: Well, she's 10 times better than that awful Amber girl that you were with. 
JERRY: yeah, Amber.. I wonder if she's back from Vegas..      
MEMBER 2: The next one, or you're meat! 
GEORGE: Alright, alright!  Seinfelds! 
MORTY: Hey, George! 
GEORGE: Shhh! Listen, you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet. I'll give it back to you later. 
MORTY: How're your folks? 
GEORGE: Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch - you don't want to know.  Give me your wallet, or I'll spill your  guts right here on the street! 
MORTY: What did you say? 
GEORGE: Come on, hurry up, old man! I'm an animal! 
HELEN: You're being very rude. Come on, Morty. 
GEORGE:  Please, please, they're gonna hit me!  
MORTY: Tell your parents we said 'Hi!'
