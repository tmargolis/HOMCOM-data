JERRY: You know their timing couldn't be worse. 
GEORGE: Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you? 
JERRY: You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up. 
GEORGE: When are they leaving for Paris? 
JERRY: Not for another three days. 
GEORGE: What about her place? 
JERRY: She lives with her parents. 
GEORGE: Really?   Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents. 
JERRY:  Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way. 
GEORGE: Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship? 
JERRY: The baldies 
GEORGE: Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town. 
JERRY: That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.    
ALEC:   Hey guys. 
GEORGE: Hey Alec 
JERRY: Hey Alec 
ALEC: This is Joey. 
GEORGE: Hey Joey, how you doin'? 
ALEC:   Hey listen, I was wondering if either one of you guys would be interested in doing some work for the Big Brother program? I'm kinda running the local chapter. What do you say George? 
GEORGE: Well uh.... 
JOEY:   Wouldn't you like to be a big brother to someone like me? Please? 
GEORGE: Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled. 
ALEC: That's great George, thanks a lot I'll get in touch with you. 
JOEY: Wouldn't you like to be a big brother.. 
ALEC:   Ya alright Joey that's enough, let's go   See ya. 
JERRY: What happened? 
GEORGE: What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid? 
JERRY:   Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?             
JERRY: Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now? 
GEORGE: Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy. 
JERRY: Ya, it's much better isn't it? 
GEORGE: Oh, n-no comparison. 
JERRY: Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries. 
GEORGE:   Hey hey hey hey hey hey. 
JERRY: What? 
GEORGE: Your parents are going to Paris right? 
JERRY: Yea? 
GEORGE: So I tell Alec that I have to goto Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris. 
JERRY: What about little Joey? 
GEORGE: Who? 
JERRY: Ah, I think he's probably better off.             
GEORGE: I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris   all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox. 
MORTY: But there are no stamps on these. 
GEORGE: Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps   I-I'll reimburse you of course. 
HELEN: Why are you doing this? 
JERRY: He wants this guy to think he's in Paris. 
HELEN: Why? 
JERRY: Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.    
KRAMER: Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion? 
HELEN: I told you it was good.   
KRAMER:   Ya 
HELEN: It's from the Sachs Fifth Avenue in Miami. 
KRAMER: Mmm   I'm gonna remember that if I'm ever in Florida. 
JERRY: Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there. 
KRAMER: Ya 
MORTY: Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home. 
KRAMER: Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle. 
GEORGE: Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something? 
KRAMER: Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow. 
GEORGE: What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then? 
KRAMER: Well I suppose the children do. 
GEORGE:   Yes I suppose they do. 
KRAMER:   Alright I gotta a ten o'clock, I'll see everybody later.    
GEORGE:   Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What about tonight?    
HELEN: Tonight?

HELEN:   Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it tonight,   we have plans. 
JERRY:   What plans? 
HELEN:   We have plans. 
JERRY: Where'd you get plans? 
HELEN:   We have plans. 
GEORGE: Well um, what about tomorrow night?

MORTY:   Hey give 'em our best though. 
GEORGE:   Ya. 
JERRY:   I'll call you later. 
GEORGE: Ya.    
JERRY: So what plans do you have? 
MORTY: None 
JERRY: So how come you're not going over there for dinner? 
HELEN: Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'. 
MORTY: We can't stand them. 
JERRY: Really? Since when? 
HELEN: Since always. We've never liked them. 
JERRY: Why? 
HELEN: Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, you never notice? 
JERRY: No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind. 
MORTY: Well we do.    
JERRY: Ya?    
ELAINE: It's us. 
JERRY: U-oh come on up.   It's Elaine you don't have a problem with her do you? 
HELEN: We adore Elaine. 
JERRY: She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend. 
HELEN: What's he like? 
JERRY: He's nice, bit of a close talker. 
HELEN: A what? 
JERRY: You'll see.   Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about the Costanzas' 
HELEN: They're exhausting it's like being in an Asylum.    
EVERYONE: Hi. 
MORTY: Hello Elaine    
ELAINE: This is Aaron. 
HELEN: Hello Aaron 
MORTY: Hello. 
AARON:   So how long you folks in town? 
HELEN: Oh, three more days, three more days then we're off to Paris. 
AARON: Ah

AARON: I love France,   I was just there last year. In fact, you know I still have an envelope full of French Franks, I'll give 'em to ya. 
HELEN: We can't take money. 
AARON: Oh, no, it's a gift.   from us. 
ELAINE: Oh, that is soo nice   Aaron. Isn't he nice?   So listen has Jerry been showin' you a good time? 
JERRY: No I haven't. 
AARON: You know   I have a friend who works at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. How would you like a behind the scenes tour? 
HELEN:   Really, you could do that? 
AARON:   Easily 
HELEN: I wouldn't be any trouble? 
AARON:   Of course not. 
HELEN: When would we go? 
AARON: How about right now? 
MORTY: I'm ready 
HELEN: Are you sure? 
AARON: Yes. 
HELEN: Ok, let me get my coat.    
AARON:   Elaine what do you say? 
ELAINE: W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans. 
AARON: Oh.   How about you Jerry? 
JERRY: I'm swamped. 
AARON: You sure? You could examine the art work up close. 
JERRY: Maybe I'll try and catch up with you. 
ELAINE:   Ya that'll happen) 
AARON:   Alright. We're off.    
MORTY: Ok, bye.  HELEN & AARON: Bye. 
JERRY: Ok buh bye. Have a good time. 
ELAINE: Bye. 
AARON: See everybody later   
JERRY: Ok. 
ELAINE: Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum? 
JERRY: I don't know. 
ELAINE: What is that? 
JERRY: Maybe he was just trying to be nice. 
ELAINE: Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this? 
JERRY: Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.    
ELAINE: What? 
JERRY:   He got em out of the house. 
ELAINE: What? 
JERRY: Call Rachel. 
ELAINE: Oh. 
JERRY:   ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel!   
ELAINE:   Sorry pal, wish I could help you out.             
FRANK: They're not coming? 
GEORGE: No, they had plans. 
ESTELLE: How could they have plans? 
GEORGE: That's what I wanna know. 
FRANK: Well what difference does it make? They wouldn't lie to us, they're are dear friends. 
ESTELLE: What am I supposed to do with all this Paella? 
GEORGE: They said tomorrow, maybe. 
FRANK: Maybe? 
ESTELLE: Maybe they don't like us. 
FRANK: Why wouldn't they like us?   Again with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for? 
ESTELLE: Ah keep quiet. 
FRANK: What are you trying to set my mouth on fire? 
GEORGE: I don't know what the reason could be.             
JERRY:   Oh, Hi, hi. 
AARON: Ah Jerry you would not believe the time we had. 
HELEN: Aaron is quite the tour guide. 
MORTY: Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings? 
JERRY: Oh sure like Monet. 
MORTY: Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean nobody would paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus. 
JERRY: Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday. 
MORTY: I say the guy was painting without his glasses.    
JERRY:   Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back. 
HELEN: Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read. 
JERRY: Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye   
AARON: Well I should be going. 
HELEN: Oh thanks again.  AARON & HELEN: Buh bye.    
AARON: Oh you must be Kramer   I've heard about you. 
KRAMER: You must be Aaron, I've heard about you. 
AARON:   Well see you later. 
KRAMER: Yeah. 
AARON:   Bye 
JERRY: Bye 
KRAMER: So uh what are you guys doing for dinner? 
HELEN: We have no plans. 
MORTY:   Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive. 
KRAMER: Now what is Executive? 
JERRY: The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it. 
MORTY: I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years. 
HELEN: Why would they? Nobody bought them then. 
MORTY: He's wearing one. 
KRAMER: Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's. 
MORTY: You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida? 
KRAMER: Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take care of everything. 
MORTY: You gotta deal.    
KRAMER: Yaaaa. 
JERRY: This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson. 
MORTY: I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery. 
HELEN: You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days. 
MORTY: He'll send them express. 
HELEN: You're crazy. 
MORTY: I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats. 
JERRY: N-na I'm paying for the trip. 
MORTY: So much the better.             
GEORGE: Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there. 
ALEC: Paris huh? 
GEORGE: Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away for. 
ALEC: Where will you stay? 
GEORGE: An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry. 
ALEC: George, you have no idea how fantastic this is. 
GEORGE: Fantastic? 
ALEC: Ya, we've been trying to reunite Joey with his father who lives in Paris. But he's afraid to fly alone, you know he's kinda withdrawn, but he seems to take to you.   So it's a perfect solution. 
GEORGE: How gee what a coincidence. 
ALEC: And you'll send me a postcard.             
AARON: Helen really seemed to respond to Renoir. I think she really connected to the way he painted children. 
ELAINE: Mm hmm. 
AARON: And that Morty, I'll tell ya that guy is full of life.   He was convinced Monet was near sighted. I kept telling him 
ELAINE: Aaron 
AARON: Yes? 
ELAINE: Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you? 
AARON: Well, they were in from out of town, I thought they would enjoy it. 
ELAINE: Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age? 
AARON: No, it was fun. 
ELAINE: You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld. 
AARON: Yea, they bought me a coke.             
KRAMER: So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat? 
MORTY: I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys.   So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror. 
KRAMER: How serendipitous. 
MORTY: So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born. 
KRAMER: Mmm 
JERRY: He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized.   Alright come on let's play. 
KRAMER: Did you call Jack Klompus yet? 
MORTY: I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now. 
JERRY: Ah come on. 
MORTY: Just a second.   
HELEN: Jerry have you seen Schindler's List? 
JERRY: No I haven't seen it yet. 
HELEN: Oh you have to go you have to 
JERRY: I'm going 
HELEN: You have to 
JERRY: Ok 
MORTY:   Hello Jack.    
JACK: Ya 
MORTY: It's Morty 
JACK: Who died? 
MORTY: Nobody died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor.   In my garage there are a couple of boxes. 
JACK: What boxes? 
MORTY: I'm gonna explain what boxes. 
JACK: Alright how the hell do I know? 
MORTY: Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me. 
JACK: I thought you're going to Paris 
MORTY: I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here. 
JACK: What's in the boxes? 
MORTY: Raincoats. 
JACK: Raincoats?   You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? That's garbage. 
HELEN: I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes. 
JACK: When do you want these? 
MORTY: Send them tomorrow.             
ESTELLE: You think they're coming tonight? 
GEORGE: I dunno they said maybe. 
FRANK: Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't come tonight they might not see us. 
ESTELLE: Well they better come, I got all this Paella. 
FRANK: I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise. 
GEORGE: Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you. 
ESTELLE: Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night? 
GEORGE: I-I wasn't in the attic. 
ESTELLE: I heard noise. 
GEORGE: Maybe it was a mouse. 
FRANK:   OK that's it! We're moving! 
GEORGE: What? 
FRANK: I will not tolerate infestation. 
GEORGE: You haven't even seen one. 
FRANK: Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never be comfortable again.    
ESTELLE: All right Frank that's enough.            
GEORGE: I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever   
RUDY: Uh huh. 
GEORGE: They will get a good home won't they? 
RUDY: Look I gotta be honest with you there's nothing here too spectacular. 
GEORGE: Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a Casanova really. 
RUDY: I'll give you uh two-hundred dollars for the three boxes. 
GEORGE: Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling. 
RUDY: Yea I'm in a good mood here. 
GEORGE: Thank you.    
KRAMER: Hey, George what are you doing here? 
GEORGE: Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things,   that's what he would have wanted. 
KRAMER: Oh, I gotcha   
GEORGE:   That'll do. 
KRAMER: Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together, selling raincoats. 
GEORGE: Hey that's swell. 
KRAMER: Yea we worked it out all over dinner last night. 
GEORGE: Dinner?   
KRAMER: Ya. 
GEORGE: You had dinner with the Seinfelds? 
KRAMER: Yea, last night. 
GEORGE: Was this something you had planned for a while? 
KRAMER: No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants. 
GEORGE:   They had plans, They had plans! 
KRAMER: Oooo, boy I've never seen these before   
RUDY: Well they just came in, part of my spring-time cruise collection. Two for twenty-five dollars. 
KRAMER: Oh I'll take these. 
RUDY: All right 
KRAMER: Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me? 
RUDY: Sure that's the Executive.  
KRAMER: Ya, you have any others? 
RUDY: I wish. They don't make 'em anymore. 
KRAMER: Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested? 
RUDY: Very interested 
KRAMER: Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak. 
RUDY: Well bring 'em in. 
KRAMER: So you'll buy them? 
RUDY: I don't see what would possibly stop me.            
GEORGE: Aaaa   aaaa   Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their   big plans!  
JERRY: What are you talking about? 
GEORGE: Mom and Pop Seinfeld 
JERRY: Look I don't know. 
GEORGE: All right I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer. 
JERRY: Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing. 
GEORGE: So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?  
JERRY: That's right. 
GEORGE: Is there something wrong with my parents? 
JERRY: Absolutely 
GEORGE: Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people. 
JERRY: These the people you currently live with? 
GEORGE: Yes. 
JERRY: Uh huh 
GEORGE: So are they coming tonight or not? 
JERRY: Look I really don't know what they're plans are. 
GEORGE: Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella. 
JERRY: What is that anyway? 
GEORGE: It's a Spanish dish. It's a mlange of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty. 
JERRY: I-I'll tell 'em 
GEORGE: Hey could you do one other thing for me? 
JERRY: Name it. 
GEORGE: You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them?   It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris.   Is that a coincidence?   Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going   
JERRY: So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris? 
GEORGE:   All right if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.         
JOANNE: So where's he taking you? 
ELAINE: Well first we're going to a matinee, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see "My Fair Lady" and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places. 
JOANNE: You are one lucky girl.   Wish I could find a nice guy.   Hi Aaron. 
AARON:   Hey Joanne.   Hey 
ELAINE:   Hi        
HELEN: Hello, Hello.    
MORTY: Hello Elaine    
AARON: I was able to finagle two more tickets to "My Fair Lady" and I thought why not ask Morty and Helen. 
ELAINE: Oh, Great. 
MORTY:   This is some office. What's the square footage? 
HELEN: You don't mind to you Elaine? 
ELAINE: Mind? Oh o-of course not. 
AARON: We can make a whole day of it. 
MORTY: This is some building, Harry Fleming used to have an office here. There was a deli on the first floor. You don't get corned beef like that anymore. What happened to that deli? 
ELAINE:   I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld      Helen, Morty, Elaine and Aaron. Morty opens a candy bar takes a bite then offers it to Elaine then Aaron who takes it as the scene changes to the Cafe 123. At the restaurant we see   Morty, Elaine, Helen and Aaron. Morty is pointing at a painting while talking to Elaine then takes off his glasses. Next George is seen getting ready to hop into a cab when Morty, Elaine, Aaron and Helen ride by in a horse drawn carriage   drinking champagne. George then smacks the top of the cab in disgust]   "I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night, and still have begged for more. I could have spread my wings, and done a thousand things, I've never done before. I never know what made it so exciting, but all at once my heart would fly"         
JERRY:   We better not.   T-They're gonna be here any second. 
RACHEL: When are they leaving? 
JERRY: In two days. 
RACHEL: It's been soo long. 
JERRY: I know. 
RACHEL: Ok, it's only two more days.    
JERRY: Right, Thursday three o'clock. 
MORTY:   I could have danced all night   I could have danced all night and still have 
HELEN: Ooh. 
JERRY: Oh Hi. 
HELEN: We didn't know you had company. 
JERRY:   Oh ya this is Rachel. 
RACHEL: Hi.  HELEN & MORTY: Hello Rachel. 
HELEN: Uh we'll come back another time. 
JERRY: What other time? 
HELEN: Whenever 
JERRY: Where you goin'? 
MORTY: Uh we'll drive around for a while. 
JERRY: You don't have a car. 
MORTY: We'll take a bus. 
JERRY: Come on stop. 
HELEN: No we don't mind 
MORTY: I'll get a book. 
RACHEL: No no it's ok, I was just leaving anyway. 
HELEN: O-oh are you sure? 
RACHEL: Yea. 
HELEN: Cuz we don't wann..

RACHEL: Definitely

RACHEL:   It's night meeting you. 
HELEN: Nice meeting you. 
JERRY: Ok, see you later. 
MORTY: Boy that was some show. 
JERRY: What show? 
MORTY: "My Fair Lady" 
JERRY: When did you get tickets to see that? 
HELEN: Aaron surprised us, and Elaine came. 
JERRY: Oh   Elaine really? Well that sounds interesting. 
MORTY: We saw Regis Philbin get out of a limousine. 
JERRY: Oh. 
HELEN: He looks better on TV. 
JERRY: Oh    
JERRY:   Hello?    
JACK: Hello Jerry,  
JERRY: Yea. 
JACK: It's Jack Klompus. 
JERRY: Oh hi Jack. 
JACK: So when are you coming down to Florida again? 
JERRY: As soon as is humanly possible. 
JACK: You know I still got that pen, the one that writes upside down. 
JERRY: Yea yea ya I shoulda kept it. 
JACK: So uh where's your father? 
JERRY: Ya he's right here.    
MORTY: Yea 
JACK: Morty, listen I can't get into the garage.  
MORTY: What do you mean? 
JACK: There is something wrong with the key. The key doesn't work 
MORTY: You gotta jiggle it a little bit. I jiggled it. I jiggled it for fifteen minutes.     
DORIS: Tell him to come down here and get his own packages. You have nothing better to do then worry about his boxes. 
MORTY: You gotta pull on the knob as you turn it. 
JACK: Get the hell outta here with your knob. 
DORIS: What does he want from you? 
MORTY: My idiot son could open that garage door. 
JERRY: What did I do? 
MORTY: Just do it first thing tomorrow. I need it.    
MORTY: They'll be here first thing Thursday morning. 
HELEN: Thursday morning? You know we're leaving at three o'clock. 
JERRY:   Yea you're leaving at three o'clock. 
HELEN: How are you gonna get all this done in time? 
MORTY: Don't worry about it. 
JERRY:   Ya how you gonna get all this done in time?         
GEORGE: They were drinking champagne in a buggy! 
FRANK: First Kramer, then Elaine? 
GEORGE: Yea 
FRANK: It's a slap in the face. 
ESTELLE:   What did we ever do to them?   I want to know what we did them! 
FRANK: What are they too good for us? A raincoat salesman, I could buy and sell 'em like that.    
ESTELLE: The hell with them. 
GEORGE:   The thing that bothers me the most, is the lying.    
FRANK: Let's forget about it. We're going on a beautiful vacation.   
GEORGE:   Vacation? 
FRANK: You're mother and I are planning on taking a cruise.    
GEORGE:   AH!   
FRANK: But I can't find any vacation clothes. They were in the attic.  
GEORGE: The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years. 
FRANK: How can I go on a cruise with out my cabana wear? I love those, those clothes.   AH!   A mouse! I saw a mouse!   
GEORGE:   It's the remote. 
FRANK:   Where the hell are my clothes? I love those clothes.         
RUDY: Lousy moth ridden crap.       I-I-I'm not crazy about used clothes. I mean they call it vintage, you know to take your mind off of what it really is 'nasty wear.' Oh it's clean you know people wear underwear, ya well they don't wear iron underwear and that's what it's gonna take to get me in those clothes. I mean I'll move into an apartment after a strange person moves out, why would I wanna move into somebody's pants? There is no vintage underwear of course, but it's not because the guy couldn't sell his underwear, it's because men wear their underwear until it absolutely disintegrates. Men hang on to underwear until, until each individual underwear molecule is so strained it can barely retain the properties of a solid. It actually becomes underwear vapor. W-we don't even throw it out, we just open a window and it goes out like dandelion spoors. That's how men throw out underwear we just go   and it's gone that it is jus.                 
JERRY: Hey. 
MORTY: Hey, Jerry. 
HELEN: So how was the movie? 
JERRY: Oh, really good, really good. 
HELEN: And didn't the three hours go by just like that   
JERRY: Like that   
MORTY: What about the end, with the list? 
JERRY: Ya that was some list. 
HELEN: What did you think about the black and white? 
JERRY:   The black and white. 
MORTY: The whole movie was in black and white. 
JERRY: Oh yea, I didn't even realize.  
MORTY: You don't even think about it, there's so much going on. 
JERRY: Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again.      
KRAMER: So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All you gotta do it jiggle it   jus get it in there   jigg jigg jiggle reiggle 
RUDY: Look, I find this whole thing very uninteresting. When you get the coats come in.  KRAMER; Ya hey I'm on your side.    
KRAMER: Hey what again? 
GEORGE: I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back.   Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.  
KRAMER: Payaya, ya I'll be there. 
GEORGE: Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say anything bad about your uh your partner. 
KRAMER: No no you know we're not partners. I only get twenty-five percent. 
GEORGE: Twenty-five percent? It was your idea.  
KRAMER: Yap I know. 
GEORGE: You're doing all the leg work. 
KRAMER: That's right 
GEORGE: He's ripping you off 
KRAMER: You're right he's ripping me off 
GEORGE: If anybody should be getting more it's you. 
KRAMER: He's ripping me off 
GEORGE: Well don't let him take advantage of you like that. 
KRAMER: YAH!   
RUDY:   Oh it's you? You're the one who sold me the moth ridden cabana crap.         
MORTY: You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent? 
HELEN: Well he told you about the place. 
MORTY: So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?  
HELEN: You find something you get a fee. 
MORTY: Finder's fee is ten percent and no more. 
HELEN: Well it's too late now. 
MORTY: Those are my coats. I saved them, I stored them, I've been waiting years for this pay off. 
HELEN: Well you're not gonna say anything.    
KRAMER: I've been thinking about something. 
MORTY: Ya so have I 
KRAMER: Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair. 
MORTY: You don't think it's fair. 
KRAMER: No no, I found the place, I set the whole thing up, I'm doing all the leg work. 
MORTY: What leg work? 
KRAMER: Oh, there's leg work. 
MORTY: If anything you're getting too much. 
KRAMER: Too much?! 
MORTY: That's right, they're my coats. 
KRAMER: Look I want thirty-five percent. 
MORTY: I'm thinking more like fifteen. 
KRAMER: No way I'm taking fifteen. 
MORTY: Well you're not getting thirty-five. 
KRAMER: Alright let's compromise. Twenty-five percent. 
MORTY: Ok it's a deal         
RUDY: Moths are a discourage to my business, all it takes is one moth to lay eggs. You know what happens to the larvae? They hatch and they're everywhere.  
GEORGE: I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back   I-I-I'll have the clothes. 
RUDY:   It's already put a dent in my fumigation bill. 
GEORGE: So uh where are the clothes?  
RUDY: I burned 'em. 
GEORGE: Oh. That's good.         
ELAINE: N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal? 
JERRY: It is a tad askew.  
ELAINE: I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it? 
JERRY: I've hardly been out to dinner with them. 
ELAINE: See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but nobody is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.  
JERRY: You're right he's insane. 
ELAINE: Yes, he's insane, that's what I think.  
JERRY: So what are you going to do? 
ELAINE: I don't know, I don't know what to do.   Oh god.... so how was the movie? 
JERRY: Uh from what I saw it was pretty good. 
ELAINE: Ya what do you mean from what you saw? 
JERRY: Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie. 
ELAINE: Yea why not? 
JERRY: I was kind of um   making out. 
ELAINE:   You were making, out during Schindler's List? 
JERRY: I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me. 
ELAINE: During Schindler's List? 
JERRY:   We're both living with our parents.  
ELAINE: Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything? 
JERRY: No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me. 
ELAINE: Oh.         
NEWMAN: Hello Mrs. Seinfeld 
HELEN:   Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here.   
NEWMAN: Uh ah   Having a nice trip?   
HELEN: Wonderful, we went to the theater last night. 
NEWMAN: Oh the theater. Because I was wondering. 
HELEN: Wondering what? 
NEWMAN: Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry. 
HELEN: Well we already saw it. 
NEWMAN: Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go. 
MORTY:   Why is that? 
NEWMAN: Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean. 
HELEN: I'm afraid I don't. 
NEWMAN: Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony. 
MORTY: What? 
NEWMAN: What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland. 
HELEN: Jerry was necking during Schindler's List? 
NEWMAN: Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent. 
HELEN: Jerry sends his laundry out. 
NEWMAN:   Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata              
JERRY: Hi   What? What did I do? 
HELEN: How could you? 
JERRY: How could I what? 
HELEN: You were making out during Schindler's List? 
JERRY: What? No. 
MORTY: Don't lie Jerry. 
JERRY:   Newman.  
HELEN: How could you do such a thing? 
JERRY: I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over.    
JERRY:   Hello.    
JACK: Hello Jerry, it's Jack Klompus. 
JERRY: Hang on a second.   Dad it's Klompus. 
MORTY: Hello 
JACK: Hello Morty, listen that key doesn't work. It's no good. 
MORTY: You didn't get in? 
JACK: Oh I got in, I had to break the window with a rock and then I got my hand all cut up reaching in. 
MORTY: You broke the window? 
HELEN: He broke the window? 
JACK: You wanted those damn boxes didn't you? 
DORIS:   He should be on his hands and knees thanking you. 
MORTY: Did you send them? 
JACK: Yea, they'll be there tomorrow afternoon, two o'clock. 
MORTY: Tomorrow afternoon? 
HELEN: Tomorrow afternoon? 
JERRY: Tomorrow afternoon? 
MORTY: I told you to send them express. 
JACK: W-well it was ten dollars cheaper in the afternoon than the morning, I figured what the hell's the difference. 
MORTY: So what did you do about the window? 
JACK: I gotta fix your window now? 
MORTY: All right all right. Goodbye.   I don't think we are gonna make that flight. 
JERRY: W-what do you mean you're not making the flight? 
HELEN: We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't the trip is off. 
MORTY: Well what's the difference we'll go some place else.    
HELEN: Some place else? What about Paris? 
MORTY: You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now. 
HELEN: I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats. 
MORTY: You don't understand fashion is cyclical this thing could come back. 
HELEN: I think you're out of your mind.       
FRANK: I just don't understand how all those clothes can disappear.  
GEORGE: Moths? 
FRANK: Moths, ate three boxes? 
GEORGE: Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere. 
ESTELLE: You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds anyway, he's an idiot all together.   Ah there's Kramer.    
KRAMER:   Hello? 
ESTELLE: Hello 
KRAMER:   Helowwwowwow   Hey   Ha ha, Good evening   
ESTELLE: Hope you're hungry.   
KRAMER: Ooo Paella 
GEORGE: Hey uh let me take you're coat. 
KRAMER:   Oh ya thanks buddy. 
FRANK: That shirt, where'd you get that shirt? 
KRAMER: Wha? 
FRANK: That's my cabana shirt, you stole my shirt you son of a bitch!   George you let your friends go up in my attic and steal my clothes?   Gimme that back 
KRAMER:   woah  
GEORGE: Dad?! 
KRAMER:   I bought it from Rudy. 
GEORGE: Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes. 
FRANK: Who's Rudy? What clothes? 
GEORGE: I sold your clothes yesterday. 
FRANK: You sold my clothes   what do you mean you sold my clothes? 
GEORGE: I didn't think you wore them anymore. 
FRANK: It's cruise wear! 
ESTELLE: Kramer, I love that shirt.  
KRAMER: Yaya 
FRANK: THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S MINE!! 
ESTELLE: You look just like Frank, on our honeymoon.  
KRAMER: Oh, well, thank you.    
FRANK: Who's this Rudy? 
KRAMER: Well Rudy's the guy buying Morty's raincoats. 
FRANK: Mory Seinfeld? He's a bum. 
KRAMER: Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his plane for it. 
GEORGE: Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight? 
KRAMER: Yea. 
GEORGE: What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em? 
KRAMER: Well I suppose they are wasted. 
GEORGE: Yes I suppose they are. 
FRANK: Tomorrow I'm going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes. 
KRAMER: A mouse!            
JERRY: You want the tickets? 
GEORGE: Yes. 
JERRY: You're gonna take this kid to Paris? 
GEORGE: Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, I mail my own postcards. 
JERRY: You know I'm paying for these tickets. 
GEORGE: It's alright, I got lunch.         
KRAMER: Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the Payaya was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella? 
MORTY: Not really. 
KRAMER: Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival, the sites, sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm 
JERRY: Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel? 
MORTY: This is it. 
KRAMER: So how much are we gonna make? 
MORTY: Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations. 
KRAMER: Wha two thousand? Three thousand? 
MORTY: That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item.  
KRAMER: More? More than three thousand? 
MORTY: Just watch me do my thing. 
JERRY: Say Dad,   isn't that one of yours?  
MORTY: Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didn't tape it, he just flipped the flaps.   Kramer you missed a couple. 
WOMAN: Bon-jour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight. 
JERRY:   Dad isn't that your charter group?    
GEORGE: Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night. 
JOEY: Hey! I got news for you four eyes, there's no way you're staying with us in Paris.         
FRANK: You burned them? Those clothes are not yours to burn. 
RUDY: Who are you anyways? 
FRANK: I'm the father. 
RUDY: He said his father was dead. 
FRANK: He said I was dead? 
RUDY: That's right. Squeezed an extra twenty-five dollars out of me. 
FRANK: That's what my life is worth to him? Twenty-five dollars.    
KRAMER: Hey, Frank! 
FRANK: Oh, I just want to you know I'm retracting our dinner invitation. 
MORTY: Well you don't have to retract it because we never went. 
FRANK: I'm retracting that it was ever offered. 
MORTY: I retract your retraction. 
FRANK: Oh, you trying to unload some of that junk of yours? 
MORTY: Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here. 
RUDY: You can keep your raincoats. I'm not interested. 
KRAMER: I thought we had a deal? 
FRANK: That's another one of my shirts!! 
RUDY: I'm not buying anymore clothes from anyone off the street. 
MORTY: Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat business for thirty-five years. 
RUDY: Ya how do I know there aren't moths like his stuff? 
FRANK: My clothes don't have moths! 
MORTY: Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats? 
RUDY: That's right. 
KRAMER:   I'm all ticklish.           
ANNOUNCEMENT: Flight-433 now boarding for Miami, Gate 18a. Flight-433 now boarding. 
MORTY: Ok, let's go. 
HELEN:   It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see us off. 
AARON: Are you sure you can't stay a little longer?  ELAINE & JERRY: NO. 
MORTY: Ah, good-bye.

JERRY: Take care 
MORTY: Alright Jer.    
ELAINE: Nice to see.. 
MORTY: Buh bye Elaine

MORTY: Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats. 
JERRY: Ok.    
ELAINE: Bye. 
JERRY: Bye.    
ELAINE: Aaron? Aaron are you ok? 
AARON: I could've done more. I could've done so much more. 
ELAINE: You did enough. 
AARON:   No, I could've called the travel agency, got them on another flight to Paris, I coulda got them out. 
JERRY: You tried Aaron, it was too expensive. 
AARON:   This watch, this watch could've paid for their whole trip.   This ring, this ring is one more dinner I could've taken them out to.   Water, they need some water   
ELAINE: Why? 
AARON:   They'll get dehydrated on the plane! Get the Seinfelds some water. Please! Please!            
JERRY: Hi Mr. Goldstein is Rachel home?  MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm afraid Rachel's not going to be able to see you tonight, or any other night for that matter.  
JERRY: Why what did I do?  MR. GOLDSTEIN:   You know very well. I heard about your behavior at the movies the other night it was disgraceful. You should be ashamed of yourself, I for one will not allow my daughter to be involved with someone of such weak moral fiber. Fortunately my postman happened to have witnessed the entire incident. A heavy set fellow, I believe he lives in your building.   Now if you don't mind.   
JERRY: Rachel!   MR. GOLDSTEIN:   Good night! 
JERRY: Rachel!         
JERRY: So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything. 
ELAINE: Aahh,   Get Out! How did it happen? 
JERRY: The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in. 
ELAINE: Oohh, boy. They could use a vacation. 
JERRY: Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them. 
ELAINE:   So how about that Aaron?  
JERRY: Whew 
ELAINE: You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked? 
JERRY: No I hadn't noticed.    
NEWMAN:   Pair of bear claws please. 
JERRY:   Hiya Newman. 
NEWMAN:   Hello Jerry. 
JERRY: Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night. 
NEWMAN: Ohh, were you there? 
JERRY: Yes I was. 
NEWMAN:   I-it's a it's a...powerful film. 
JERRY: Yes, shocking brutality don't you think? 
NEWMAN:   Shocking. 
JERRY: Yes, well that was nothing.    
NEWMAN:   Jerry! Jerry!           
GEORGE: Where the hell is your father?!          
ESTELLE: This is the best thing we ever did. 
FRANK: I just hope those exterminators know what they're doing. 
ESTELLE: Ah forget about them let's just...
