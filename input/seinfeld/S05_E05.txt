STAN:Look at that Jerry, look at that.Sucking, sucking...
Jerry:Yeah, I looked. I saw.
STAN:This doesn't make you uncomfortable, does it?
Jerry:Uncomfortable? Not at all. (ASIDE TO ELAINE) See your friend'swife's breast sticking out - why would that make meuncomfortable?
STAN:Look at him.
Jerry:How long do they do that?
STAN:Oh, a year or two.
Jerry:No break?
STAN:Then comes the weaning.
Jerry:So after the sucking, comes the weaning.
ELAINE:First the sucking then the weaning.
Jerry:Well, you gotta wean.
STAN:Gotta wean.
ELAINE:It's a must wean situation.
George:What about that spot I got?
Jerry:Yeah, that's a great spot.
George:You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into thehospital. You can't beat that spot. I'm on a roll. I am justwilling these great parking spots. In front of my house. In frontof Jerry's building. Did I tell you about the spot in front ofthe post office?
Jerry:Yes.
George:I'm driving to the post office.
Jerry:(INTERRUPTING) George.
George:Maybe the baby would like to see my spot. A positive, upliftingmessage to start his life out with. You can still get a greatspace in this town - if you apply yourself.
Jerry:Where's KRAMER? He should've been here by now.
ELAINE:Did you give him the room number?
Jerry:Yes, 1397.

George:Look at it. I pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car infront of me and the car behind me.
Jerry:Will you shut up.
ELAINE:I'm taking a cab home. I can't take it anymore.
Jerry:So what were you about to say, Stan?
STAN:Myra and I would like you and Elaine to be the Godparents ofSteven.
ELAINE:Wow.
Jerry:Me? A godfather?
STAN:Yes.
Jerry:(A LA DON CORLEONE) Never go against the family, Elaine.
ELAINE:What?
KRAMER:The pig-man! I saw a pig-man! He was just lying there and then hewoke up. He looked up at me and made this horrible sound (MAKESSOUND).
George:Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
KRAMER:I'm talking about the pigman, George. I went into the wrong roomand there he was.
George:A pigman?
KRAMER:Yes, a pigman. Half pig, half man.
ELAINE:That's nice, Kramer... So, anyway, what exactly is involved inbeing a Godparent?
Jerry:(A LA DON CORLEIONE) Elaine, don't ever ask me about mybusiness!.... (SHEEPISH) "Godfather."
MYRA:Nothing really.
STAN:The most important thing is to help with the bris.
Jerry:The bris?
ELAINE:The bris?
KRAMER:A bris? you mean snip snip?
STAN:Yeah.
KRAMER:I would advise against that.
ELAINE:Kramer. It's a tradition.
KRAMER:Well, so was sacrificing virgins to appease the gods, but wedon't do that anymore.
Jerry:Well, maybe we should.
George:Why are all those people milling around my car?
KRAMER:I don't know.
Jerry:Maybe they're admiring your spot.
KRAMER:No. They're all looking up.
George:Oh my god, there's somebody on the roof of the hospital.
KRAMER:Whoa. That's the guy who asked me where the staircase was.
George:Jeez, I hope he doesn't.. Oh no!
George:My car! My car!CUT TO:(Jerry George, Elaine, Kramer)INT JERRY'S APARTMENT DAY (2)
ELAINE:A mohel! What the hell is a mohel?
Jerry:A mohel is the person who performs the circumcision.
ELAINE:Where am I going to find a Mohel?(LOOKING THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES, MUTTERING) How do you find amohel? Motels, models..
Jerry:Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find aMohel. I have the tough job. I have to hold the baby while theydo it. How would you like that job?
ELAINE:Have you ever seen one?
Jerry:You mean that wasn't -
ELAINE:Yeah.
Jerry:No.. you?
ELAINE:Ya.
Jerry:What'd you think?
ELAINE:(SHAKES HER HEAD) No...
Jerry:Not good?
ELAINE:No, had no face, no personality, very dull. It was like amartian. But hey, that's me.
Jerry:Hey.
George:Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix thatroof than the car's worth, So I'm gonna go see the hospitaladministrator today. Someone's paying for that damage and it'snot gonna be me.
Jerry:Ah, you're screwed.
George:I know, swan dives from twenty floors, lands right on to it. Whatdo I have a bulls eye on there? He couldn't move over two feet?Land on the sidewalk. That's city property.What are the chances, what are the odds? He couldn't do it againif his life depended on it...
ELAINE:Well I have to interview a Mohel.
Jerry:Oh, poor Elaine. Look at her. Attended the finest finishingschools on the Eastern seaboard. Equestrian competitions.Debutante balls. Well, look at you now. Interviewing Mohels.
Jerry:What's the matter?
ELAINE:Are you alright?
KRAMER:Don't even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed.(RE:PAPER) Look at that.
Jerry:What now?
JERRY:"Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research".." Governmentfunds genetic research at area hospital" ... Yeah, so?
KRAMER:Pigman, baby. Pigman.
ELAINE:Oh, if I hear about this pigman one more time...
KRAMER:I'm tellin ya the pigman is alive. The governments beenexperimenting with pigmen since the fifties.
Jerry:Will you stop it. Just because a hospital gets a grant to studyDNA doesn't mean they are creating a race of mutant pigmen.
KRAMER:Oh. Jerry wake up to reality. It's military thing. They'reprobably creating a whole army of pig warriors.
George:I wish there were pigmen. You get a few of these pigmen walkingaround I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants tofix me up at least they could say, "Hey he's no pig-man!"
Jerry:Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for the pig-men. Nomatter what the deformity you'll find some group of pervertsattracted to it. "Oo that little tail turns me on."
ELAINE: GROANS AND HEADS FOR THE DOOR.
ELAINE:(MUMBLES) Alright, that's about enough
Jerry:Oh, what's the matter you're not interested in this?
ELAINE:No, it's fascinating, could you do me a favor, could you tape therest of the pigmen and the women who love them discussion andI'll listen to it next time I'm here. I've got to find a Mohel.
KRAMER:You should call this off, Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual.
ELAINE:Perhaps one day when the pigmen roam free it will be stopped.Until then, off with their heads.
ELAINE: LEAVES.
George:But Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?
KRAMER:Oh, that's a myth. Besides, you know, it makes sex morepleasurable.
George:Yeah. So how does that help me?
Jerry:(TO GEORGE) Hey George, have you ever seen one?
George:Yeah, my roommate in college.
Jerry:So what'd you think?
George:I got used to it.
Jerry:Alright, I'm waiting. I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig-man.
KRAMER:Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna show him to you, and you'll never bethe same.
Jerry:Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this. You know a lot ofpeople have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men.
KRAMER:Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished oinkof pigman cries for help.
Jerry:If I hear an anguished oink, I'm outta here.
KRAMER:I can't let this go on.
Jerry:Let me understand this. So if you find the pigman, your intentionis to ...emancipate him?
KRAMER:That's right. (CALLING OUT)Sue-wee!
Jerry:Kramer! well I don't see any pig-men. Look (HE POINTS ATPASSERBY) Human, human, human...
JERRY:(WITH MOCK ALARM) Wait a minute!... Oh, that's George.
George:Okay. The administrator's on the third floor. I'll meet you guysby the car.
KRAMER:You got room for the pig-man?
George:The pig-man can take the bus.
KRAMER:You know, if pig-man had a car, he'd give you a ride.
George:How do you know? What if Pigman had a two-seater?
KRAMER:Come on George, be realistic.
George:All right, if pig-man comes along, we'll squeeze him in. I'll seeyou later.CUT TO:(George, Mrs. Sweedler)INT HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - DAY 2Mrs. SWEEDLER:Mr. Costanza, come in, come in. It's been a very trying couple ofdays around the hospital. Patients, doctors, everyone, just griefstricken over this unfortunate occurrence.
George:Well, I join them in their grief.Mrs. SWEEDLER:Horrible, just a horrible thing. Flew right past the children'swing. All the sick children, in the playroom, looking out thewindow, just traumatize by the incident. Apparently, they allthought he was flying. You know how children are, "Oh look. A manis flying. A man is flying" And then, splat...
George:Yes, splat. Exactly. Splat. That's where I come in. On splat. Yousee, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler?Mrs. SWEEDLER:Mrs. Sweedler's fine.
George:You see, that trudge affected me in a very, very personal way.Mrs. SWEEDLER:How is that?
George:Yes, you see, the deceased landed on my car. The splat, as itwere, actually took place on the roof of my car. I can't help butthink that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy may havebeen averted but I've never been the type to buy a convertible,what with the baldness and all.Mrs. SWEEDLER:Well I've known bald men who owned convertibles. They wore a hat.
George:Well then it's all pulled down. Anyway. The damage,unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, renderingit virtually undriveable.Mrs. SWEEDLER:(STIFFENING) Yes, well, that is a shame.
George:Yes, a shame. That's just how I would describe it. Now, with alldue sensitivity and discretion, bearing in mind the scope of thesituation, I can't help but think the hospital bears someresponsibility to compensate the other, still living "victim", ofthis horrendous, horrendous tragedy.Mrs.SweedlerMr.Constanza.
George:Yes.Mrs. SWEEDLER:A man plummeted tragically to his ultimate demise -
George:Yes.Mrs. SWEEDLER:... and you greedily, callously try to profit from it.
George:(PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET)Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimates that I'm notreally profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..Mrs. SWEEDLER:(WITH ANGER) How dare you.
George:What?Mrs. SWEEDLER:Have you no decency? Have you no shame?
George:Yes.. you know, depending.Mrs. SWEEDLER:Get out! Get out, now! get out of my office.
George:Should I leave these with you?Mrs. SWEEDLER:Get out!CUT TO:(Jerry, Kramer, resident)INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR DAY 2

Jerry:How did I get to be Godfather? I don't even know him that well.Just cause we're on the softball team and I'm the pitcher andhe's the catcher he thinks we have a relationship?
ELAINE:I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport.
Jerry:Maybe in hardball it's more involved you know they have signalsand everything. I'm just lobbing it in. We don't haveconferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.
