TOM: What do you mean made up? 
JERRY: It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish. 
TOM: You're crazy. 
JERRY: No I'm not.  George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish? 
MICHAEL: What do you mean Danish? 
GEORGE:  This guy stinks.  
JERRY: Danish. Is it from Denmark? 
MICHAEL: No, they make it in New Jersey. It's just a Danishy name. 
TOM: I can't believe that. They fooled *me* Jerry. 
RITA:  Boy, talk about a show about nothing.  
GEORGE: Uh, excuse me.  Excuse me.  This--This is not right. May I?  You see, you're going: "They fooled *me* Jerry!"  You wanna hit 'fooled' more: "They *fooled* me Jerry!". You see the difference? 
TOM: I'm not gonna say it like that. 
GEORGE: Just a suggestion.   YELLING GUY:  All right everybody, take a five. 
GEORGE:  Yep. That's five! 
JERRY: George?  I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines. 
GEORGE: Why is that? 
JERRY: I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing? 
GEORGE: Oh, you're fine... you're fine.  So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins? 
JERRY: Why would he steal a box of raisins? 
GEORGE: Yeah, it's bizarre.    
RITA:  What's with him?  Russell?  Russell? 
RUSSELL: What? 
RITA: You O.K.? 
RUSSELL: Yeah. No, uh, I was just thinking of something. I'll be back in a second.    
SANDI: What's the matter? 
JERRY: Nothing. 
SANDI: You're acting weird. Is anything wrong? 
JERRY: No. 
SANDI: Are you breaking up with me? 
JERRY: Are we going out? 
SANDI: You're breaking up with me, aren't you?  
JERRY: Do you want me to break up with you? 
SANDI: If that's what you want. 
JERRY: I don't even know what you're talking about. 
SANDI: Fine. Break up with me. 
JERRY: All right. We're broken up. 
SANDI:  Can we still be friends?    
GEORGE: Remember when you came to audition for us? 
TOM: Yeah. 
GEORGE: There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left? 
TOM: What are you talking about? 
GEORGE: Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know , maybe you took them with you. 
TOM: Are you accusing me of stealing the raisins? 
GEORGE: Oh, no, no-- 
TOM:  Why would I steal a box of raisins!? 
GEORGE: No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring.  
TOM: Let me give you a word of advice. O.K.? I want you to stay away from me. I don't wanna talk to you, and I don't wanna hear anymore of your stupid little notes and suggestions. I don't like you. So if you got any other problems whether it's raisins, prunes, figs, or any other dried fruit, just keep it to yourself and stay out of my way, O.K.? 
GEORGE: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that.  Good talking to you Tom. Really.   
RUSSELL:  Elaine. Elaine. What do you want? What can I do? Is it my job? Is that what it is? Elaine I can't go on like this. Will you call me? Would you call me? Well, why? All right. May I call you? Elaine? Elaine?  
DAVID: Excuse me Mr. Dalrimple. I am so sorry. 
RUSSELL: All right. All right. What's your name? 
DAVID: David Richardson. 
RUSSELL: Get out! You're fired! 
DAVID: But Mr. Dalrimple-- 
RUSSELL: Don't talk back to me. Didn't you hear what I say? Get out! You want me to call the cops? I make and break little worms like you every day. Do you know how much money I make? Do you have any idea! Do you know where I live? I can have any woman in this city that I want. Any one. Now, GET OUT!  What are you all looking at? Go back to work! BACK! NOW!      
GEORGE: The doc called and said the lab's backed up and now I'm not gonna get the results for another two days. 
JERRY: Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying. 
GEORGE: What do you mean? 
JERRY: Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing! 
GEORGE: Come on you're... uh... you're fine. 
JERRY: This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this. 
GEORGE: What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease. 
JERRY: This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind. 
GEORGE: The guy playing Kramer threatened me. 
JERRY: Why? 
GEORGE: 'cause I asked him about the raisins. 
JERRY: You mentioned the raisins. 
GEORGE: Oh yeah. 
JERRY: Did he take 'em? 
GEORGE: I don't know. 
JERRY: Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em? 
GEORGE: That's what I'm trying to find out.   
JERRY: Hey. 
KRAMER: Hey. 
JERRY: Any luck? 
KRAMER: No. No, nothing. I got no... peristalsis. 
JERRY: What about bran? 
KRAMER: I tried bran-- 40%, 50% 100%. The bran isn't working for me. 
JERRY: Well my friend,  it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus. 
KRAMER: Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area. 
JERRY: Oh, it's not that bad! 
GEORGE: Yes it is.   
ELAINE: Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway. 
JERRY:  So, you going to the taping tomorrow night? 
ELAINE: No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit. 
JERRY: Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you. 
ELAINE: Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable. 
JERRY: We need you there! 
ELAINE:  Hey are you gonna go? 
KRAMER: No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front.       The taping is about to begin.  People are walking into the studio.  Jerry is getting a makeup.  Michael walks around backstage, he seems nervous and agitated.  Rita, Stu and Jay are sitting in the crowd. Russell is missing.  George looks at his lip in a mirror.  Tom is sitting in his dressing room, eating the raisins.  Elaine walks into the studio, wearing and adjusting a blonde short-haired wig, and also wearing bold glsasses.  Scene cuts to the drugstore where Kramer is buying the dreaded apparatus.  Sandi, sitting next to Jerry who's still getting a makeup, is having her hair done. 
SANDI:  No! Pick it up more in the front! It's got to be higher! Higher! Make a wall! A wall!  ASSISTANT DRESSER: Sandi, are you in wardrobe? Sandi? 
JERRY: Try Elaine.  ASSISTANT DRESSER: Elaine? 
SANDI: Yes?   
WILTON: Elaine? It's me-- Wilton Marshall. Remember? Camp Tioga-- 1978? Remember? 
ELAINE: Oh, right. 
WILTON: Wow! You know you haven't changed a bit.   
MICHAEL: I can't remember my lines!!! 
JERRY: Just relax, you'll be fine. 
MICHAEL: I can't relax. I don't know what line! I don't know any of 'em! 
JERRY: You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing! 
MICHAEL: Help me Jerry! Help me!   
RITA:  Where is Russell? 
STU: You know I don't know. I thought he was coming. I assumed he wouldn't miss it. 
JAY: He hasn't been well. 
STU:  Can I tell you something in confidence? I think it's a woman. 
RITA: How pathetic.   
GEORGE: This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much.        
GEORGE:  Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh. 
TOM: How would you like it if I just pulled your heart out of your chest right now, and shoved it down your throat?    PAT HAZELL: Are you ready to meet our cast?  All right.     
JERRY: Good evening, folks. How you doing?  Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--  JOE DEVOLA:  SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS!      
GEORGE: Sic semper tyrannis? What is that, Latin? 
JERRY: Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln. 
GEORGE: Really? What does it mean? 
JERRY: It means: "Death to tyrants". 
GEORGE: I can see that.   
ELAINE: See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already? 
JERRY: No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal? 
ELAINE: Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it. 
GEORGE: Yeah, me too. 
JERRY: Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him? 
ELAINE: No. 
JERRY: Strange. Even not showing up at the taping...   
KRAMER: Hey, pistol-packin mama, you swing that gal around, Allemande left with the old gray hag, around and around you go. Yee-ha!! 
JERRY: Well, well, well.

JERRY: A wallet? Let me see that. 
ELAINE: Here. 
JERRY: Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time. 
GEORGE: Shh! This is it!

JERRY: You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that.  "Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you".

JERRY: Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series? 
ELAINE: I didn't know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know, that's not my fault. 
GEORGE: Yes it is! You're very charming! 
ELAINE: I can't believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he? 
JERRY: No one knows.
