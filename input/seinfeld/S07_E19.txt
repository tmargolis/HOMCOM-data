Jerry: "I'm looking for a crested blazer" 
Craig: "A crested blazer.." 
Jerry: "I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me."  Craig : :" Yes .I Think we may have something."   The Joseph Aboud crested blazer is the finest....  That's hand ticking around the crest and these are the world famous  Corriso buttons made from the finest Andulo corn." 
Jerry:  "Hmm.. they'll match my sneakers." 
Craig: "It looks fabulous on you... shall I wrap it up?" 
Jerry: "You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone  and see what they think." 
Craig: " A Hum!" 
Jerry: "Really I'll be back." 
Craig: "Yeah!"  Cuts to Jerry's apartment.  George is pacing back and forth with the phone and Elaine and Jerry are talking.    
Jerry: "So I didn't like the crest all that much., but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me  so to get out of the store I told I wanted to see what someone else thought....  And then he makes a face like he doesn't believe me." 
Elaine: "Ah! So he knew that you were making it up.!" 
Jerry: "Yeah..... He caught me"  "So here's what I want you to do. Come back with me to the store and we'll pretend  to look at the coat." 
Elaine: "That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat?" 
Jerry: "Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't." 
Elaine: "But you were!!" 
Jerry: "But if you go back with me , then I'm not." 
George: "All right fine.... Whatever"  Kramer walks in. 
Jerry:  " Problems with the house guest?" 
Elaine: "What house guest?" 
George: "This friend of Susan's is staying with us for two weeks...Now am I  wrong or is that excessive?" 
Kramer: "Well Bob Sacamano he stayed with me once for a year and a half." 
Elaine: "Who is he?" 
George: "He's a wig master" 
Elaine: "What is a wig master?" 
George: "He's with the touring company of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.  He's the guy in charge of the wigs." 
Jerry: "Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice." 
Kramer: "About some tickets George , you know I'd kill for a peek.." 
George:  "Yeah, Sure, sure ,,, I got to drop my car off at the new lot." 
Kramer: "Euh what...What lot is that?" 
George: "Jiffy Park. It's incredible.. Seventy-five dollars a month." 
Kramer: "Seventy -five bucks a month!" 
George: " Yeah and you get this really cool T-shirt when you sign on.." 
Kramer: " Oh I'm down."  Cuts to the Andover shop 
Jerry:  "Remember me? I said I 'd come back with someone and I did."  "Surprised?."

Elaine:  "Ohhh!!." 
Craig: "I especially enjoy the catalogue, those fanciful narratives really take me away.." 
Elaine: "Ohhh!! really ..well you know what, I write those." 
Craig: "No!!!" 
Elaine: "Yeeeahh!!!" 
Jerry:  " Hey Elaine What about the crest.? What d'you think of the crest  here."  Elaine "Well I love it... " 
Jerry: "You what??" 
Elaine: "I think it's great. I think you should get it." 
Craig: "Well .... Will it be check or credit card?" 
Jerry:  "Check." 
Craig: "I'll need you to write down your phone number on the check for me.   "Perhaps you could do the same." 
Elaine:   Cuts to a street where Jerry & Elaine are walking 
Jerry: "You weren't supposed to say that." 
Elaine: "But I really did like it" 
Jerry: "That's not the point. You put me in a position where I had no choice." 
Elaine: "uhn... Sorry!" 
Jerry: "And what about that guy asking you out right in front of me?" 
Elaine: "What is the big deal!!" 
Jerry: "...'s very emasculating, he doesn't know the nature of our relationship. You're  there approving new clothes.....That's a girlfriend job! How dare he!!" 
Elaine: "He dared...."  Cuts to George's apartment as he comes in. 
Ethan: "Hi George.. How was your day?" 
George: "Good....good day  You?" 
Ethan: "I am getting so much work done..... See?" 
George: "Very nice" 
Susan:  "Hi sweety How was your day? 
Ethan: "I already ask him that. He said Good...Good day...."  George scratches his head and the scene cuts to Jerry and Kramer's hallway 
Kramer:  "Thank god you're home. I'm wiped out.  I drop my car at Jiffy Park and I forgot to take my apartment keys off the ring.  So you got my spare?"  Jerry : "No I gave it back to you"

Kramer: "I'm not going to take the bus that's why I got a car!" 
Jerry: "Forget it." 
Kramer: "Awright I'm gonna get George to pick me up."

Jerry: "Oh Yeah we went way out and wild." 
Elaine: "Hey Jerr..." 
Jerry: "Hi Elaine."  In comes a lady selling roses 
Lady: "Would you like to buy a rose for your wife? "  Craig and Elaine both laugh

Susan: "..So you're telling me the truth?" 
George: "Of Course I'm telling the truth." 
Susan: "Because I have to be able to trust you... If I can't trust you then there's no way that  this can work." 
George: "Really!" 
Susan: "Yeah."  George : "Well then...then you really have something to think about because.....you know if there's  any doubt in your mind ....and.. and,, it doesn't even have to be a big doubt, you know  even a tiny doubt, a DOT of a doubt.. and....."

Elaine: "Hem!! No reason."  Cuts to Jerry's apartment. Jerry and Kramer are watching tv. 
Jerry: "You know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on Elaine right in front of me.  He stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems  to like. You know what I'm gonna do.? I'm gonna take that jacket back.. I'm putting this guy  ....RIGHT OUT OF COMMISSION...." 
Kramer: "Heeeeeummmrph.... I'm gonna turn in"

Kramer: "Well you can go to your room and read." 
Jerry: "Hey look ,you know, you're the one who's locked out. I'm letting you stay here.  You're wearing my bathrobe. You should adapt to me." 
Kramer: "But I'm tired.."

Jerry: "Well that's all I got." 
Kramer: "Can I sleep with you?" 
Jerry: "Huh?" 
Kramer: "Well you got that big comfortable bed and that nice warm quilt." 
Jerry: "Kramer , there's no way you're sleeping with me." 
Kramer: "Why?"

Elaine: "You want it?" 
Kramer: "Yeaaahmm...." 
Elaine: "You can have ,I don't need it anymore." 
Kramer: "Ooh Mama... 
Elaine: "Ok so ..I am positive you are wrong about Craig." 
Jerry: "Yeah Why?" 
Elaine: "Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too... a man Jerry." 
Jerry: "So ,Who is he?" 
Elaine: "Some friend of his from England." 
Jerry: "Don't you see?...........It's all a big scam." 
Elaine: "You're nuts!" 
Kramer: "How do you know he's not wondering the same thing about you?"  Elaine : "What d'you mean?" 
Kramer: "What do I mean?.. Well perhaps he thinks that you're working him for the  discount. Shaking that little butt of yours into big, big savings.... And then when  you get it,you know, you drop him like a hot potato. 
Elaine: "Aawwh Please....." 
Kramer: "Now see the two of you need to work on trust... and then and only then will there be a free  exchange of sex and discounts.. Cornerstones of a healthy relationship....and now if you  would  excuse us. We need to get to bed."  Scene cuts to Jerry's bed. Lights are out. Kramer opens the light and starts to read. 
Kramer: "hmmm....patio furniture's on sale."  Cuts to the Jiffy Park the next morning. 
George: "Excuse me...huh... I think I made a big mistake. I'd like my deposit back please." 
Attendant: "Whats the problem" 
George: "You got hookers turning tricks in my car. How's that for starters." 
Attendant: "Haaan! That is all hearsay." 
George: "Allright, very good I'd like my car and my deposit back please" 
Attendant: "Can't do it' 
George: "Whadday'mean.?" 
Attendant: "If you read the agreement you signed the deposit is not refundable." 
George: "Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse?  'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either.." 
Attendant: "What can I tell you buddy. Take it up with Consumer Affairs." 
George:. "All right , just give me my car and let me get the hell out of here." 
Attendant: "Well that's going to be a problem" 
George: "Why?" 
Attendant: "It's all the way in the back. Can't get it out for a couple of days." 
George: "What are you talking about.. I WANT MY CAR!!" 
Attendant: "We ask that you please bear with us." 
George: "Bear with you! This is a parking lot PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GET  THEIR CARS!!!" 
Attendant: "Ideally.."  Scene cuts to the Andover shop. 
Jerry: "Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket." 
Teller: "Certainly. May I ask why?" 
Jerry: "........For spite..." 
Teller: "Spite?" 
Jerry: "That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me." 
Teller: "I don't think you can return an item for spite." 
Jerry: "What do you mean?" 
Teller: "Well if there was some problem with the garment. If it were unsatisfactory in some way,then  we could do it for you, but I'm afraid spite doesn't fit into any of our conditions for a refund" 
Jerry: "That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is." 
Teller: "Let me speak with the manager...excuse me .............Bob!"    Teller "........spite....." 
Bob: "What seems to be the problem?"  Jerry : "Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she  won't take it back." 
Bob: "That's true. You can't return an item based purely on spite." 
Jerry:. "Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it" 
Bob: "Well you already said spite so......" 
Jerry: "But I changed my mind.." 
Bob: "No...you said spite...Too late."  Cuts to a terrace where Kramer is sitting with Ethan and a woman.  They make fun of a woman walking by. 
Kramer: "It's Halloween  
Charmaine: "Get a calendar honey! It's the 90's"

Jerry: "Well he doesn't even want himself there."   
Charmaine: "Why don't you sit down and join us?" 
Jerry: "All right."   Elaine : "I can't I 've got to meet a friend." 
Kramer: "Well what are we ...dog meat."  Ethan  ....Champagne Coolies , please." 
Ethan:  "You've got really beautiful hair."  Elaine "Oh Thanks, thank you very much." 
Ethan: "Have you ever thought about selling it .It would make a brilliant wig.." 
Jerry: "They make wigs out of human hairs?"  Ethan "..And pay plenty for them." 
Elaine: "Well you guys are gonna have fun here so..bye take care"

Craig: "Oh! yeah. The Nicole Millers ...hemm.. Well the funniest thing." 
Elaine: "Huh! 
Craig: "I've learned that the new shipment's coming in by boat...  which does tend to take a little longer with, you know ,what with the waves and all  .. So you'll just have to be a little bit patient ." 
Elaine: "Hummm.... so you've no idea when.. they'll arrive." 
Craig:  ...Nno....I really don't......  Back to the terrace with Jerry and Ethan 
Ethan: "How can she go with a guy like that , he's a mess... I just don't see them together at all"  A man approaches.

Jerry: "Well we're sitting here together. Why wouldn't you think that." 
Jessie: "I dont know. I just didn't." 
Jerry: "Well it's very emasculating.."  Jessie looks befuddled and leaves.  Back to Elaine's phone rings. 
Elaine: "Hello." 
Bob:. "Hi this is Bob from the Andover Shop. I'm trying to reach Craig Stewart. He left this  number." 
Elaine: "Uhmmm huh! Is it important.? 
Bob: "Well....." 
Elaine: "Let me ask you something. ahemm..Do you know when the Nicole Millers are coming in from  Milan?." 
Bob: "Nicole Millers, We're not expecting any Nicole Millers, in fact we have too many as it is."  Elaine "Well do you have any in a... size four.?" 
Bob: "Yes several.. Just tell him he doesn't have to be in tomorrow before Eleven." 
Elaine:  Oh! yeah I'll make sure he gets the message."  Elaine then looks at the sleeping Craig and thinks "They make wigs out of human hair....And pay  plenty for them."  she then picks up a pair of scissors..  Scene cuts to a woman in a white coat and hat leaving a store. Her hat gets caught in a gust of wind.  and starts rolling down the street. Kramer picks up the hat with the walking stick and puts it on.  He struts down the street with the Dreamcoat/hat/stick looking very much like a stereotype pimp.  He goes to the Jiffy Park to pick up the Cadillac" 
Kramer:  Ohhh Sweet Maria. Hey! lets go.  Out comes the hooker with a client. 
Kramer: "Hey What are you doing in my car? Hey!Hey!Hey! Where you going."
