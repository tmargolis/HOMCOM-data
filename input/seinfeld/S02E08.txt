JERRY: You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one: as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have  a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call  my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. "Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies." So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we  understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin  them whenever I want!        
TV VOICE:  Look, Sigmund. Look in the sky. The planets are on fire. It is just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like  flaming globes, Sigmund. Like flaming globes.. Ah, ha, ha, ha..               
ELAINE: What do you got, a cucumber? 
GEORGE: Yeah, so what? 
ELAINE: You're bringing in an outside cucumber? 
GEORGE: They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber. 
JERRY:  What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit.   Wait a second, wait a second.. "Fax me some halibut." Is that funny? Is that a joke? 
ELAINE: No. Let me see that.  Don't-mess-with-Johnny." 
JERRY: Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show? 
ELAINE:  Did you mess with Johnny, Jerry? 
GEORGE: Let me see that.  
ELAINE: Hey, where's Kramer? 
JERRY: I don't know. That's like asking "Where's Waldo?" 
GEORGE:  I think I'm having a heart attack. 
JERRY: I don't think that's it. 
GEORGE: I'm not kidding. 
JERRY: What does that mean? 
ELAINE: I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack. 
JERRY: Oh, he's having a heart attack. 
GEORGE: Tightness.. 
JERRY: C'mon. 
GEORGE: Shortness of breath.. 
JERRY: Oh, this is ridiculous. 
GEORGE: Radiating waves of pain.. 
JERRY: I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country.  I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure  and not watch it. 
GEORGE: There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm. 
JERRY:  He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks. 
GEORGE: Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed. 
JERRY: So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital? 
GEORGE: Manhattan Memorial, less of a line. 
JERRY: I'll call an ambulance.    
WAITRESS: Is everything alright? 
GEORGE: We'll just take a check.  You made a mistake  on the.. 
ELAINE: George!       
MAN: Ooohhh... Argghhh.. 
GEORGE: Are.. are you okay? 
MAN: Ooooooohhh.. 
GEORGE: I'm George.. George Costanza.. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any  ice cream. I always felt that- 
MAN: Shut up!   
JERRY: Well? What do you think?  NURSE 1: "Salami, salami, bologna." Definitely. 
JERRY: "Salami salami bologna"? 
DOCTOR:  Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes. 
JERRY:  What a surprise.  Hey, how  ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic? 
GEORGE: No, no thanks. 
JERRY:  You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have? 
GEORGE: Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket. 
JERRY: Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out.. 
GEORGE: Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short. 
JERRY: No, I tried it on. It fits good. 
GEORGE: Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all.. 
JERRY: Well, you know.. 
GEORGE:  Well, okay. 
JERRY: Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis? 
GEORGE: Susan Davis?  Hey, wait a second.. 
JERRY: Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you. 
GEORGE: I don't know.. you and Susan Davis? 
JERRY: You know, if your future was a little more certain.. 
GEORGE: Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished.  It's all over for me. In fact, let's  end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face. 
JERRY: Well, ah..  What? Kind of like this?  
GEORGE: What are ya doing?! Whadya, crazy?!   
ELAINE: Jerry! 
JERRY:  Elaine, what are you doing here?  
GEORGE:  Jerk off.   
JERRY:  There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.   
ELAINE: Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?   
GEORGE: I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my  anger..  Hey, is anybody listening?!   
DOCTOR:  Uh, hello.  Uh, Mr. Costanza? 
GEORGE:  Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better. 
DOCTOR: Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up. 
GEORGE:  Oh God, Mommy! 
DOCTOR: And you simply haven't had a heart attack. 
GEORGE:  I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you. 
JERRY:  Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now? 
DOCTOR: No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe. 
GEORGE: Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me. 
DOCTOR: Well, I wouldn't go that far. 
GEORGE:  What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?! 
DOCTOR: Have you ever had your tonsils taken out? 
GEORGE: My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid. 
DOCTOR: Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too. 
GEORGE: Really? 
ELAINE:  Whose tonsils grow back?  
DOCTOR: It happens. 
JERRY: Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays. 
ELAINE: I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils. 
DOCTOR: That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people. 
JERRY:  Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues. 
GEORGE:  Excuse me! 
DOCTOR: Anyway, I strongly recommend they come out. 
GEORGE: What? You mean with a knife? 
DOCTOR: Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice  cream. 
GEORGE:  Yeah, that's what they told me the last time. 
DOCTOR: Think about it.  Excuse me. 
ELAINE:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question.  
JERRY: Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.   
KRAMER: Hey. 
JERRY: Hey. 
KRAMER: Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital!  So, how  did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs. 
JERRY:  Kramer. 
KRAMER: The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next  thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage. 
JERRY: Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack. 
KRAMER: No? That's good. 
GEORGE: I have to have my tonsils taken out. 
KRAMER: Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here. 
JERRY:  It's routine surgery. 
KRAMER: Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a  window going, "My name is Bob" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you.. 
GEORGE: Well, what should I do, Kramer? 
JERRY: Well, for one think, don't listen to him. 
KRAMER: I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just  gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind. 
JERRY: Eckman? I thought he was doing time? 
KRAMER: No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel. 
JERRY: A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor. 
KRAMER: He's holistic, George. He's holistic. 
GEORGE: Holistic.. that sounds right. 
JERRY: George, you need a medical doctor. 
GEORGE:  Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital? 
JERRY: Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand. 
GEORGE: Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge? 
KRAMER: First visit? Thirty-eight bucks. 
GEORGE: Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.       
GEORGE: So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here? 
JERRY: Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though. 
GEORGE: All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm  already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes  in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm. 
JERRY:  I've never had a really good pickle. 
GEORGE: Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?   
TOR:  Would you not put your foot on that please? 
JERRY: Sorry.   
TOR: What month were you born? 
GEORGE: April. 
TOR: You should have been born in August. Your parents would have been well-advised to wait. 
GEORGE: Really? 
TOR: Do you use hot water in the shower? 
GEORGE: Yes. 
TOR: Stop using it. 
GEORGE: ..Okay. 
KRAMER: I'm off hot water. 
TOR: Kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery. 
GEORGE: Yes, yes I am. 
TOR:  I think we can help you. See, unfortunately, the medical establishment is a business like any other business. And business needs  customers. And, they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery. 
GEORGE:  Can I use hot water on my face? 
TOR: No. You know, I am not a business man. I'm a holistic healer. It's a calling, it's a gift. You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain  sick. You see, that insures good business. You're not a patient. You're a customer. 
JERRY:  And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life. 
GEORGE:  What about shaving? 
TOR:  You're eating too much dairy.  May I?  
GEORGE: I guess so. 
TOR:  You see, you are in disharmony. The throat is the gateway to the lung. Tonsillitis, adenoiditis, is, in Chinese medical terms, and invasion  of heat and wind. 
JERRY:  There's some hot air blowing in here.. 
TOR: You know, I lived with the Eskimos many years ago, and they used to plunge their faces into the snow. 
GEORGE:  Could it be lukewarm? 
JERRY: Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?       
DOCTOR: ..The tongue.. yes, the tongue.. or, in medical terms, the glossa. It's a muscular organ.. Consists of two parts.. the body, and the root.. You see, it's  covered by this mucous membrane.. These little raised projections are the papillae, which give it that furry appearance. Very tactile..   
ELAINE: Uh-huh.     
TOR:  Your tea is ready now. This will solve your so-called tonsil problem. It's a special concoction. It contains crampbark. 
JERRY: I love crampbark. 
TOR: Cleavers. 
JERRY: Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car. 
TOR: And some couchgrass. 
JERRY: Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly.   
KRAMER: Go ahead, drink it, George. 
JERRY: Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't read.  I was wondering if- 
TOR:  Oh, yes.. yes.. "Cleveland 117, San Antonio 109..  
KRAMER: Go ahead, drink it, George. 
GEORGE:  Hey, it's not too bad..       
GEORGE:  I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man! 
DRIVER:  I didn't take your Chuckle, man! 
ASSISTANT: I had five Chuckles. I ate a green one, and the yellow one, and the red one is missing! 
DRIVER: I don't even like Chuckles! 
JERRY:  Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible. 
GEORGE: My face! My face! Get me to the hospital! 
ASSISTANT: I want that Chuckle! You hear me?! 
JERRY:  I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle? 
ASSISTANT:  Pull over! 
DRIVER: Pull over? Did you say pull over?! You want a piece of me?! 
ASSISTANT: Yeah! 
JERRY: You're gonna fight? 
GEORGE: Now?! I'm a mutant! 
KRAMER:  Hey, let me drive. 
ASSISTANT: Come on, man. Pull over! 
DRIVER: Alright! I'm gonna mess you up, man!   
JERRY:  Really, gentlemen, please. 
GEORGE: My heart! My heart!  Where you going? Are you crazy?! 
ASSISTANT: I'm gonna kick his ass. 
KRAMER:  Hey, you have keys? 
GEORGE: You can't leave! This is an ambulance! This is an emergency!   
JERRY: All this for a Chuckle. 
KRAMER: What's a Chuckle? 
JERRY: It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors.       
DOCTOR: You see, taste buds run on grooves along the surfaces. 
ELAINE: Can you let go of my tongue now? 
DOCTOR: What? 
ELAINE: Let go of my tongue! 
DOCTOR:  Oh, sorry. 
ELAINE: Well, I should get going..  What are you doing? 
DOCTOR: I was going to kiss you good night. 
ELAINE: A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think so.        
JERRY: You just can't leave him out there. 
DRIVER: I told him I was gonna mess him up. 
KRAMER: Well, can you call him an ambulance? 
DRIVER: I told him I didn't take his Chuckle. I don't eat that gooey crap! 
KRAMER: hey, watch the road! Watch the road, man! 
DRIVER:  Hey, man, you want some of what he got?!  JERRY AND KRAMER: Watch out!         
JERRY: How ya doing?  Can't talk?  Hey, how'd you get the plastic one?  I like that.  So how's life without tonsils?  What? What's  that? ..So, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like, five, six thousand?..  Well, live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went  to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy..  What are you doing?   
ELAINE: Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something.  Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing.   
JERRY: Hey, check the TV.    TV VOICE:  It's just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like flaming globes, Sigmond. Like flaming globes. Ah, ha, ha, ha.. 
JERRY:  That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so  funny?! ..That's not funny.. There's nothing funny about that.  MAN IN NEIGHBORING BED: Shut up!   
MAN: Aaahhhgggg!     
JERRY: I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter  how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. "Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better  in my life." Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know,  becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, "I had a heart attack this big  ..but, I gave myself one of these.  Clear!  Brrhht.. and it's gone!"
