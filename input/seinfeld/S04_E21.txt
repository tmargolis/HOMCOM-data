Jerry: Is that bothering you? 
Elaine: No, not at all...        
Elaine: Oh, could you please hurry? 
Jerry:  "Please hurry". Look at you. Look at what you've  become. 
Elaine: What? What have I become? I haven't "become" anything... 
Jerry: Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes? 
Elaine: I don't want to keep him waiting... 
Jerry: He'll like you more... 
Elaine: That's impossible...        
Wife: Andrew, why do you have to pick your teeth at the table? 
Husband: Leave me alone. 
Jerry: Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon...       
Jerry: So, where am I dropping you? 
Elaine: His place... 
Jerry: This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop  you off at his apartment... 
Elaine: *And* he gets the rest of my chicken...        
Jerry: So, is tonight "the night"? 
Elaine: You never know... 
Jerry: Oooh! Bay-bee *doll*!        
Jerry: Boy, do you smell something? 
Elaine: Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of *course* I  smell something. 
Jerry: What is it? 
Elaine: I think it's B.O.! 
Jerry: What? 
Elaine: It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O. 
Jerry: It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this. 
Elaine: Jerry. It's *B*.*O*. 
Jerry: But the whole car smells. 
Elaine: So? 
Jerry: So when somebody has B.O., the "O" usually stays with the "B".  Once the "B" leaves, the "O" goes with it.        
Elaine: I can't believe you ski! 
Carl: I'm a great skier. 
Elaine: Yeah? What else? 
Carl: Let's see... I ski, I fish, I pillage, I plunder... 
Elaine:  Oh! You "pillage and plunder"? 
Carl: ...When I travel. 
Elaine: See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages and  plunders! I'm so lucky.        
George: This'll only take a second. 
Kramer: Yeah, I'm going to poke around...        
George:  Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A *lesbian*  sighting. Oh-ho! My lucky day. They're *so* fascinating. Why is  that? Because they don't want us. You gotta respect that...        
George:  Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?        
Susan: George? 
George:  Argh!  Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What are  you doing here?! 
Susan: Renting a video! What do you got there? 
George: Oh, ... some stupid movie... 
Susan: This is Mona.        
George: Oh, hi... 
Mona: Pleasure to meet you. 
George: Yes. Well... 
Mona: Well, I'll let you two, uh... catch up.       
Susan: You okay? 
George: Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time. 
Susan: And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman. 
George: Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I  think thats fan*tastic*! I've always encouraged experimentation!  I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to? 
Susan: I *know* who I'm talking to. 
George: Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, uh,  that, uh... 
Susan: I liked women? 
George: There you go.       
George: So, uh, how long has this been going on? 
Susan: Since you and I broke up. 
George: Ssssso, after me, you... went that way? 
Susan: Yeah. 
George: Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very  nice.        
Susan: So, what have you got there? 
George: Oh, I, uh-- 
Susan: Oh, ``Rochelle, Rochelle'' 
George: It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually. 
Susan: Yeah... A lot of nudity in that, huh? 
George: No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* nudity.  It's... *sidal* nudity...       
Clerk: Next. 
George: Oh, that's me. 
Susan: Alright, well... Good seeing you, George. 
George: Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the  whole thing, there.       
Clerk: Uh, what are you returning? 
George:  ``Rochelle, Rochelle''. 
Clerk: Ah, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''... "A young girl's strange, erotic  journey from Milan to Minsk"...       
Clerk: Uh, that'll be, uh... $3.49. 
George: $3.49? It says $1.49. 
Clerk: Well, you didn't rewind it. There's a $2.00 charge for not  rewinding. 
George: What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage! 
Kramer: George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to  keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't  give him the satisfaction. 
George: I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again...        
Jerry: So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I  figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve  hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a *punch* in the  *face*, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had *gained*  strength throughout the night... 
Elaine: Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that  I would *rather* smell than what's livin' in your car. 
Jerry: What about skunk? 
Elaine: I don't mind skunk. 
Jerry: Horse manure? 
Elaine: I *loooove* horse manure.       
Jerry: Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I  went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get  the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my  responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now,  and *demand* they pay for it. 
Elaine: Absolutely.       
Elaine: Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he  tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean? 
Jerry: It means he's lying.       
Elaine: Wow... 
Jerry: Why? Is that what he told you? 
Elaine: Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early some  time... 
Jerry: No. Never. 
Elaine: Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in the morning. 
Jerry: Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will  *always* trade sleep for sex.        
Elaine: Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am? 
Jerry: Anything's *possible*...        
Jerry: What's the matter with you? 
Kramer: Steinbrenner! He's ruinin' my life... 
Jerry: Oh yeah, Steinbrenner... 
Kramer: I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll  just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with  Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff... 
Jerry: I know the list...        
Kramer: What's that smell? 
Jerry: What smell? 
Kramer: Ooooh... You stink. 
Jerry: Whatd'ya mean I stink? 
Kramer: You *stink*. Why don't you go take a shower? 
Jerry: I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in  the car! 
Elaine: So? 
Jerry: Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me!  It's alive! 
Elaine: If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl  said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I  have B.O.! Me!        
Kramer: What happened? 
Jerry: What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's  destroying the lives of everyone in it's path.        
George: What is that? B.O.? 
Jerry: Yeah. 
George: This is *unbelievable* B.O. 
Jerry: I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me  in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like  it.       
George: So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this? 
Jerry: No, no. It's the valet guy. 
George: No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism. 
Jerry: Oh... No, that's ridiculous. 
George: What if her experience with me *drove* her to it? 
Jerry: Suicide, maybe, not lesbianism.       
George: The woman she's "lesbianing" with? Susan told me she's *never*  been with a guy.       
George: Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.! 
Jerry: There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a "Smell  Gestapo". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a  big, soapy brush...       
George: Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing  now... It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out, I  never would've broken up with her. 
Jerry: Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...        
Jerry: Here he is... that's the guy!   No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back!        
Restaurateur: What do you mean-- "stunk up"? 
Jerry: I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink? 
George: Stinks. 
Jerry: Stinks! 
Restaurateur: Well, perhaps *you're* the one who has the odour... 
Jerry: Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy! 
Restaurateur: Really? Well, I smell you now. 
Jerry: That's from the car! 
Restaurateur: Well, maybe *you're* the one who stunk up the car, rather  than the car stinking up you! 
George: Oh, it's the chicken and the egg... 
Jerry: Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car;  see which smells worse. 
Restaurateur: I don't have time to smell cars. 
George: Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the  source... 
Jerry: You've gotta smell the car 
Restaurateur: I'm a busy man 
Jerry: C'mon! One whiff! 
Restaurateur: Alright, one whiff...        
Restaurateur: Alright! I give up! I admit it! It stinks! Now will you  let me out! 
Jerry: Alright, will you pay for the cleaning? 
Restaurateur: Yes! 50 dollars! I'll give you 50 dollars!        
Restaurateur: I'm not paying for *that*. They've already got my seven  dollars...  "...erotic journey from Milan to  Minsk"...        
Carl: The valet had such bad B.O.? 
Elaine: Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The "O" went from the  valet's "B", to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry  thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so... 
Carl: That's a relief...        
Elaine: What? 
Carl: It's still there... 
Elaine: No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!        
George: Listen, I gotta ask you: I was a little concerned that perhaps I  was responsible in some way for your, uh... metamorphosis. 
Clerk: That'll be $98.00. 
George: What $98.00? 
Clerk: That's what I said. $98.00. 
George: How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!?        
George: So, was it me? 
Susan: Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me  about?  Here. 
George: Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back. 
Susan: Yeah, *sure*... I gotta go. 
George: Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever  to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take  turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work? 
Susan: You're an idiot. 
George: Why? That's a *legitimate* sociological question. 
Susan: I'll see ya. And George, by the way... You stink... Real bad. 
George: It's not me! It's the car!        
Mona: I didn't think I'd come. 
Kramer: I knew you would. 
Mona: Oh, Kramer!        
Jerry: Let's do it.        
Hairdresser: The first thing we're gonna do is flush the follicles with the  five essential oils. Then, we put you under a vapour machine,  and then a heated cap. Then, we shampoo and shampoo and  condition and condition. Then, we saturate the hair in diluted  vinegar-- two parts vinegar, 10 parts water. Now, if that  doesn't work, we have one last resort. Tomato sauce. 
Elaine: Tomato Sauce?        
Jerry: Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!        
Carl: It still smells.        
Jerry: It still smells! 
George: How could it still smell after all that? 
Jerry: I don't know! 
George: Well, what are you gonna do? 
Jerry: I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car! 
George: You're *selling* the car!? 
Jerry: You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more  powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be  helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can  get for it. 
George: Maybe I'll buy it. 
Jerry: Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This  is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing!        
Elaine: I still smell! 
Jerry: You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's  the beast!        
Susan: Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there! 
Jerry: Susan! 
Susan: Kramer! 
Jerry: What is going on? 
Susan: You know what's going on? First, he vomits on me. Then, he burns  down my father's cabin. And now, he's taken Mona away from me. 
George: He stole your girlfriend? 
Susan: Yes. She's in *love* with him. 
George: Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.        
Jerry: That's the *least* of what you've accomplished...        
Elaine: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second.  I don't get this. This woman has *never* been with a man her  *entire* life-- 
Kramer: I'm Kramer.        
George: I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want? 
Susan: I just don't know what she sees in *Kramer*. 
George: Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other  girls... 
Susan: You think so? 
George: Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian. 
Susan: You're very sweet... 
George: Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I  gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that  woman, I can't get you out of my mind. 
Susan: Really? 
George: Yeah, you're just so... hip.        
George: Oh, my God... 
Susan: What? 
George: It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.        
Allison: George? 
George: Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you? 
Allison: Good. You know, you owe me $50... 
George: Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan,  Allison. 
Allison: Nice to meet you... 
Susan: Nice to meet you... 
Allison: That's a beautiful vest... 
Susan: Thank you...        
Kramer: I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment;  it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the  atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. It's like a ski lodge.       
Salesman: What year did you say this was? 
Jerry: '90.       
Kramer: Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she  tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early. 
Jerry: That's strange...       
Salesman: How many miles you got on this thing? 
Jerry: 23 000.       
Kramer: And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm  wearing *your* jacket... 
Jerry: Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!        
Salesman: I can't sell this car. 
Jerry: This... **thing**... has got to be stopped!        
Hairdresser: So, what do you want to do? 
Elaine: Sauce me.
