MERYL: Good morning. 
JERRY: Good morning. 
MERYL: How'd you sleep? 
JERRY: Hey, you are the couch tonight, young lady. You were all over my side. 
MERYL: I was not! 
JERRY: C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed! 
MERYL: By the way, you're falling way behind on the 'I love you's.' 
JERRY: No, no, 12-8! 
MERYL: No, it's 15-8. 
JERRY: I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive. 
MERYL: Alright c'mon, let's get some breakfast. 
JERRY: Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor.   Haven't worn this one in a long time.  MERYL  : Ooh, cashmere? 
JERRY: No, gore-tex. It's new.   Hey, look at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look at that. 
MERYL: Wow, this is really old. You don't know whose it is? 
JERRY: No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner. Maybe we should ask him. 
MERYL: Alright, we'll stop over there. 
JERRY: Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast? 
MERYL: Pancakes. 
JERRY: Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes. 
MERYL: I don't know that!  
JERRY: But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike. 
MERYL: I'll get the short stack. 
JERRY: Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9.   Hey, how ya doin.' 
KRAMER: We just got back from breakfast. The pancakes were dynamite. 
JERRY: Hey, is that my maple syrup?   
MERYL: You bring your own syrup? 
KRAMER: Got to.  JERRY  : You got a lot to learn about pancakes.
MARTY  : This is my wife. She died eight years ago. I been looking all over for this! 
JERRY: Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket? 
MARTY: Well, see here, the chain is broken...it must have slipped in when I was, uh...  
JERRY: Oh, wow. 
MARTY: I turned my house upside-down looking for this! It's all I have left of her. 
MERYL: Oh, that's so touching.  MARTY  : Know what I'm gonna do for you? I'm gonna give you and your family 25% off all your dry-cleaning from now on. 
JERRY: Oh, come on! 
MARTY: What are you talkin' about? 
JERRY: It's silly! 
MARTY: Hey, forget it! 
JERRY: Get outta here! 
MARTY: It's done!  JERRY  : Alright. 
MERYL: Well, I guess I get it too, because I'm his wife.  MARTY  : I didn't know you were married. 
JERRY: Oh...yeah...you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld.  MARTY  : Sure, you get the discount, too. 
JERRY: You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes... 
MERYL: I'm taking him to the cleaners! 
JERRY: Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...  I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run! 
ELAINE: Oh, hi Greg. 
GREG: Haven't seen you in a while. 
ELAINE: Yeah. Well, today was the first day I worked out since the Central Park Mini-Marathon. 
GREG: You ran the Mini-Marathon? 
ELAINE: No, but I exercised that day.   
GREG: Well, I gotta take off. 
ELAINE: Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people who can say that and mean it.   Um, do you have the time?  
GREG  : Eleven-thirty.  
ELAINE  : Eleven-thirty? 
GREG: Wait, ten-thirty. Sorry. 
ELAINE: Oh. 
GREG: Do you have to be somewhere? 
ELAINE: No. 
GREG: Then what are you doing? 
ELAINE: I'm just waiting for my friend George, we worked out together. 
GREG: Oh. Well, it was good seeing you. 
ELAINE: Yeah, nice to see you, too.            
MERYL: Uh, would you, um...can I... 
JERRY: Pardon? 
MERYL: The syrup. Would you pass the syrup?  JERRY  : Oh, you want to try the syrup!   
WAITRESS: Can I get you anything else? 
JERRY: Um, yeah...I think my wife and I'll have a little more coffee. 
WAITRESS: Okay. 
MERYL: And a check for my husband.  JERRY  : To my beautiful wife. 
MERYL: To my adoring husband. 
JERRY: Adoring? What about handsome? 
MERYL: I like adoring. 
JERRY: Sure, adoring's good for you, what does it do for me?    
OWNER  : Excuse me...where did you get that? 
JERRY: I, uh...well... 
OWNER: Uh, we don't allow any outside syrups, jams or condiments in the restaurant.   And if I catch you in here with that again...I will confiscate it. 
JERRY: Well, I told my wife not to bring it.        
KRAMER: Really? 25% off? Do I get that, too? 
JERRY: No, just Meryl. 
KRAMER: Why, why? Why does she get it? 
JERRY: Because she's my wife!   And I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying "my wife." Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - "my wife" this, "my wife" that...it's an amazing way to begin a sentence. 
KRAMER: "My wife has an inner ear infection." 
JERRY: See? 
KRAMER: I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too? 
JERRY: Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking all your dry-cleaning in! 
KRAMER: C'mon, just this one time! It's expensive! 
JERRY: Alright.   
KRAMER: Hey. Hey Elaine, what do you say if neither of us is married in ten years, we get hitched? 
ELAINE: Let's make it fifty. 
KRAMER: We're engaged! Alright, I'm gonna get my quilt.   
ELAINE: Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club? 
JERRY: The fly-boy. 
ELAINE: Yeah. 
JERRY: Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you. 
ELAINE: I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss. 
JERRY: So? 
ELAINE: So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic. 
JERRY: Really. 
ELAINE: Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But his lower lip landed well below my rim. 
JERRY: Moisture? 
ELAINE: Yeah. Definite moisture. 
JERRY: That's an open-lip kiss, alright. 
ELAINE: Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship.   Yeah?  GEORGE  : Oh, uh...it's George. 
ELAINE: Hey, what happened to you?  GEORGE  : Nothing...little problem. 
ELAINE: Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting. 
GEORGE: Can I come upstairs, please?    ELAINE  : I mean, maybe he wants to ask me out. 
JERRY: I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk. 
ELAINE: Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and he ignores me. 
JERRY: Yeah, so? 
ELAINE: I respect that.   Mmm, what happened? 
GEORGE: Nothing, I... said it was a little problem. 
ELAINE: Yeah? What was it?  GEORGE  : Well...I was in the locker room showering, and I...I had to go, so... 
JERRY: Here we go. 
GEORGE: Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look. 
ELAINE: You went...in the shower? 
GEORGE: Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one!    ELAINE  : Do you go in the shower? 
JERRY: No, never.  ELAINE  : Do you? 
KRAMER: I take baths. 
GEORGE: Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back? 
ELAINE: Ever hear of...holding it in? 
GEORGE: Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys. 
ELAINE: How do you know? 
GEORGE: Medical journals! 
JERRY: Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?    
JERRY: Hello. 
MERYL: Oh, hi...honey. 
JERRY: What are you doing here? 
MERYL: I just thought I'd drop off a few things. 
JERRY: Oh.   Well, I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty.   
MARTY: Another quilt? Huh?    UNCLE LEO: Jerry! 
JERRY: Uncle Leo!  UNCLE LEO: Hello! 
JERRY: Hello.  MARTY  : So, if you or your wife want to drop by on Wednesday, it should be ready.  UNCLE LEO: Your wife?  JERRY  : Yeah...my wife.  UNCLE LEO: What are you talking about? 
JERRY: Uh...I got married.  UNCLE LEO  : You got married? I wasn't invited? Nobody sends me an invitation? 
JERRY: Well, it was sudden.  UNCLE LEO: Are you ashamed of your uncle? Do I embarrass you? 
JERRY: No, no, it was a small ceremony.  UNCLE LEO: Haven't I always been a good uncle? 
JERRY: Yes, yes, you have.  UNCLE LEO: Who told you when you went to school that you print well? 
JERRY: You did, you did.  UNCLE LEO  : When he was younger, he had a beautiful penmanship. I used to encourage him to print. 
JERRY: I'm a good printer.  UNCLE LEO: I remember your 'V.' It was like a perfect triangle. Whoa, there's my bus!   Hello! Wait!
GREG: I'm glad you're here. This can get really boring. Do you know where I can get some good olives? 
ELAINE: I can find out. 
GREG: Would ya? 
ELAINE: Sure.   
GREG: By the way, you look really great in that leotard. 
ELAINE: Oh, thanks.   
GREG: Hey, you know what's weird? I think I had a dream about you last night. 
ELAINE:   Um, you know Greg, I... 
GREG: Can I have a sip of your water? 
ELAINE: Oh, yeah, sure.   
GREG: Thanks.    ELAINE  :    GREG  : I'm sorry, what were you saying? 
ELAINE: It was nothing, forget it.   
GREG: See that guy right there? I caught him urinating in the shower. I'm thinking about turning him in, too.          
MERYL: Honey? Could you get me something to drink?  JERRY  : You're right there. 
MERYL: C'mon, I'm sitting!    JERRY  : Honey, what'd you do with the can opener? 
MERYL: I didn't do anything with it. 
JERRY: Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday. 
MERYL: It's in the first drawer. 
JERRY: I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here. 
MERYL: Yes, it is.  JERRY  : Hey...I'm not stupid. I'm looking in that drawer, there's no can opener. 
MERYL: Did I say you were stupid?  JERRY  : Well, wouldn't I have to be? You tell me there's a can opener in the drawer, I'm looking in the drawer, there's no can opener - what other conclusion could one reach?    MERYL  : Do you want me to go find it?  JERRY  : Yes. I do. You show me where there's a can opener in that drawer.   Hello! I'm sorry, I'm just fighting with my wife.    
HELEN: Jerry, we just heard, what's going on? 
MORTY: Why the hell didn't you tell us? 
JERRY: Listen, Ma...  MERYL  : It was in here yesterday!  JERRY  : Yeah, that's what I said! 
HELEN: Who is she? When did this happen?  MORTY  : I told her you'd get married. She thought you'd never do it. 
HELEN: Morty, you're talking too loud. 
MORTY: I'm not talking loud! 
HELEN: You're hurting my eardrum.  MERYL  : Well, you must have done something with it!  JERRY  : I'm on the phone! 
HELEN: Is she there? Can we talk to her? What's her name? 
JERRY: Mom, I'm not married. 
HELEN: What? 
JERRY: I'm not married! 
MORTY: I knew it, I told ya!  HELEN  : Uncle Leo said. 
JERRY: I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning. 
HELEN: A discount on dry-cleaning?  JERRY  : Could you make a little more noise?   Listen, I'm gonna have to call you later.  MERYL  : Well, I give up. 
JERRY: Well, whoopie whoop.   
KRAMER: Got any coffee? 
JERRY: Yeah.   I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired? 
KRAMER: My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold.   I can't get into a zone! 
JERRY: What is that?   
KRAMER: Oh, I forgot. 
JERRY: Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff. 
MERYL: Yeah, me too. Love you. 
JERRY: Love you. 
MERYL: Well, goodnight. 
JERRY: Goodnight.          Commercial break.
GEORGE: They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them! 
ELAINE: So what do you want me to do? 
GEORGE: Talk to him! 
ELAINE: How can I do that? 
GEORGE: You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!  ELAINE  : Yes, but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water! 
GEORGE: Well, that doesn't mean anything! 
ELAINE: Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!  JERRY  : She's right, George. Bottle-wipe is big. 
GEORGE: Well, what about the open-lipped kiss? 
JERRY: Bottle-wipe supercedes it. 
GEORGE: Yeah, you're right, you're right.   Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him? 
ELAINE: George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him. 
GEORGE: Why? 
ELAINE: I...I don't know... 
GEORGE: Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?! 
ELAINE: No, that's not it! 
GEORGE: Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is! 
ELAINE: Why couldn't you just wait? 
GEORGE: I was there! I saw a drain! 
ELAINE: Since when is a drain a toilet?! 
GEORGE: It's all pipes! What's the difference?! 
ELAINE: Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em up! 
GEORGE: I'll call a plumber right now!   
JERRY: Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?  ELAINE  : Okay! Okay! I will talk to him.   
KRAMER: Jerry, I think that quilt is ready. 
JERRY: Alright. 
KRAMER: Well, you gotta pick it up for me! 
JERRY: Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it! 
KRAMER: I'm so tired!  ELAINE  : Boy, you don't look good. 
KRAMER: Huh? I don't? 
ELAINE: No, you look pale. 
KRAMER: Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today!   
JERRY: Hello? Oh, hi honey.   Yes, I told him. I'll get it.   Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry...
MARTY: I'm sorry, it's not ready yet.   
KRAMER: Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here? 
MARTY: Who the hell are you? It's not your quilt. 
JERRY: He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally. 
MARTY: Well, uh...maybe tomorrow.  KRAMER  : Maybe. 
JERRY: Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay. 
KRAMER: Alright, I'm gonna see you later. 
JERRY: Where you goin'? 
KRAMER: I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible! I'm gonna hit the tanning machines. 
JERRY: I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya. 
KRAMER: Hey, that's how I maintain my glow. 
JERRY: I'm goin' home.    PAULA  : Excuse me? Uh, how much would it cost to clean this? 
MARTY: Oh, about thirteen dollars. 
PAULA: Thirteen? Well, I can't afford that. 
MARTY: Well, I'm sorry.
GREG: Hey, Elaine. I'll be off in a second.   
ELAINE: I got the machine next, buddy.    GREG  : It's all yours.   
GEORGE: What happened? Did he bring it up? 
ELAINE: Never mind that, look at the signal I just got. 
GEORGE: Signal? What signal? 
ELAINE: Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy. 
GEORGE: I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness! 
ELAINE: Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal. 
GEORGE: A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal? 
ELAINE: Yeah! It's a social thing. 
GEORGE: What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning me in, that I got the goods on him! 
ELAINE: No! I won't be a party to this. 
GEORGE: So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination? 
ELAINE: Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position.
PAULA: I won't let you do this! 
JERRY: I want to! 
PAULA: But it isn't right! I can't. 
JERRY: Give me the clothes. 
PAULA: Jerry, please. What about her? 
JERRY: Oh, the hell with her.   
PAULA: No, Jerry, please! 
JERRY: I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.  PAULA  : I can't fight you.   
JERRY: Do you want box or hanger? 
PAULA: You decide.
ELAINE: You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh? 
GREG: Yeah.   Oh, there's the manager. Good. I think I'm gonna talk to her about that guy, you know, we cannot have people like that in here. 
ELAINE: Are you sure you want to do that? 
GREG: Yeah. He's disgusting! Besides, I'll take any chance I can to talk to her. 
ELAINE: You're interested in...in her?   
GREG: Very. 
ELAINE: Ah. You know, uh...I'm engaged.   Yep, gettin' married in fifty years.   
GREG: Oh good, there he is. I wanna be able to point him out. 
ELAINE: You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you. 
GREG: Why? 
ELAINE: Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it? 
GREG: Oh, I see...you're friends with the urinator, aren't you? 
ELAINE: Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.
MARTY: Here you go, Mrs. Seinfeld...with your 25% discount, it comes to $17.80. 
MERYL: Here you go.   Excuse me, this isn't mine. 
MARTY: Oh, yes it is. Your husband brought it in himself. 
MERYL: Really?   Thank you.
ANNA: That's him!
MERYL  : You son of a bitch! 
JERRY: I'm sorry. 
MERYL: Who is she? I want to know who she is. 
JERRY: It doesn't matter. I want a divorce. 
MERYL: A divorce? Oh, so you can marry her and give her the discount? 
JERRY: Yes, that's right. 
MERYL: What happened to us, Jerry? 
JERRY: I'll tell you what happened. We got married. 
MERYL: I'm sorry, this is my fault. I pushed it on you. 
JERRY: No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage. 
MERYL: Goodbye, Jerry. Oh, I forgot... ...this is your maple syrup. 
JERRY: It's alright, I want you to have it. 
MERYL: Okay, thanks. 
JERRY: We'll always have...pancakes. 
MERYL: Bye, Jerry.       Cut back to Kramer at Anna's door.  GRANDPA  : I thought you said you was bringin' a white boy home! I don't see a white boy! I see a damn fool!
