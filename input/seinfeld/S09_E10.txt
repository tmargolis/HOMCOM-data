ELAINE: So.. Whatley's still Jewish, huh? 
JERRY: Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.   
TIM: Hey! Happy Chanukah! 
JERRY: Hey, Tim. Great party.   
TIM:  eh? 
ELAINE:  eh. 
TIM:  Oh.  Hey, George, thanks again for getting me those Yankee tickets. 
GEORGE: Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew.  
TIM:  Oh, hey, listen, I'd better circulate..  Happy Chanukah, Tiffany!  
ELAINE: This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah. 
GEORGE: I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks..  
ELAINE: Oh..  I got denim vest checking me out.  Fake phone number's coming out tonight. 
JERRY: You have a standard fake? 
ELAINE: Mm-hmm. 
JERRY:  That's neat. 
ELAINE:  No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God!   
DENIM VEST: Hi!   
JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry. 
WOMAN: Hi. JERRY: You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast.   
ELAINE: Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons  
DENIM VEST: They're snaps. Listen, maybe we should, uh, go out some time? 
ELAINE: Why don't I give you my phone number?       
GEORGE: Hey. 
JERRY: Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks? 
GEORGE: Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today. 
JERRY: Didn't you call in sick yesterday? 
GEORGE: Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing: "We don't care, and it shows." 
JERRY:  You're gonna open your mail here? 
GEORGE: Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this.  "Have you seen me?"  Nope.  Woah, something from Whatley. 
JERRY: See? You give, and you get. 
GEORGE:  "This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance."? 
JERRY: Oh, that's nice. 
GEORGE: I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying "I've given your gift to someone else!" 
JERRY: To a children's charity! 
GEORGE: Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!   
ELAINE: Hey! 
JERRY: Hey.   
ELAINE:  Oh, nothing for me.  I'm going to "Atomic Sub" later. 
JERRY: "Atomic Sub"? Why are you eating there? 
ELAINE: I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine  captain. 
JERRY: What does that mean? 
ELAINE:  Free sub.   
ELAINE: What? 
GEORGE: Nothing. It's a card from my dad. 
ELAINE: What is it?  "Dear son, Happy Festivus." What is Festivus? 
GEORGE: It's nothing, stop it.. 
JERRY: When George was growing up.. 
GEORGE:  Jerry, No! 
JERRY: His father.. 
GEORGE: No! 
JERRY: Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday. 
ELAINE: Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place. 
GEORGE:  Alright.. 
JERRY: And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?   
GEORGE: Jerry! Stop it! 
JERRY: And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?   
GEORGE: I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?!        
ELAINE: Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest! 
JERRY: So? 
ELAINE: I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it! 
JERRY: No, you walk out. 
ELAINE: Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it. 
JERRY: No, you wait for the movie! 
ELAINE:  I want that free sub. 
JERRY: You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized!  They're cloning sheep now. 
KRAMER:  No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean  Martin show! 
JERRY: So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it? 
ELAINE: That's a good idea.   
KRAMER:  Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye.  Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work. 
JERRY: What strike? 
KRAMER: Yeah, H&H Bagels. That's where I worked. 
JERRY: You? 
ELAINE: Worked? 
JERRY: Bagels? 
KRAMER: Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card.  Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years. 
ELAINE: Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time. 
KRAMER: Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity. 
ELAINE: What were your.. demands? 
KRAMER: Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now. 
ELAINE: I believe that's the new minimum wage. 
KRAMER: Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go.  
JERRY: Why didn't you ever mention this? 
KRAMER: Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing!       
KRAMER: All right, everybody! I'm back! 
MANAGER: Who are you? 
KRAMER: Cosmo Kramer.. strikes over. 
MANAGER: Oh yeah! Kramer. 
KRAMER: Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back? 
MANAGER: NO, I"m sure they all got jobs.. like, ten years ago. 
KRAMER: Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for.. 
MANAGER: I could use someone for the holidays.. 
KRAMER: Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel!  What are those? 
MANAGER: Those are rasin bagels. 
KRAMER:  I never thought I'd live to see that..       
ELAINE: So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake. 
BOOKIE: So. You're Elaine Benes. We've been getting calls fro you for 5 years. 
ELAINE: So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number.. 
BOOKIE:  Hey, Charlie! Guess who's here. Elaine Benes.   
CHARLIE: Elaine Benes?!   
BOOKIE: You make a lot of man friends. You know who's a man? Charlie here, he's a man. You know who else? Me. I'm a man. 
CHARLIE:  I'm a man. 
ELAINE: Ohh.. my.. 
BOOKIE: I'll have this best guy call your real number. You just, uh, give it to me. And that way, I'll have it.  
ELAINE: My number? Ohh..  Okay.. Uh, well, there you go.  And, uh, tell you what..  put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont.       
TIM: Hey, Jerry. 
JERRY: Hey, Tim. 
TIM: What's up? 
JERRY: Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party. 
TIM: Mazel Tov.   
GWEN: Jerry.. hi. 
JERRY: Gwen? 
GWEN: Yeah. 
JERRY:  Really? 
GWEN: Yeah! Come on, our table is ready.       
GEORGE: So, attractive one day - not attractive the next? 
JERRY: Have you come across this? 
GEORGE: Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face. 
JERRY:  Like the Batman villain? 
GEORGE:  If that helps you.. 
JERRY: So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up: The good, the bad, or the ugly. 
GEORGE:  Clint Eastwood! 
JERRY: Yeah. 
GEORGE: Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley.  
JERRY:  "A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund." - What is that? 
GEORGE:  Made it up. 
JERRY:  "The Human Fund. Money for people." 
GEORGE: What do you think? 
JERRY: It has a certain understated stupidity. 
GEORGE:  The Outlaw of Josey Whales! 
JERRY: ..Yeah.     
KRAMER: Ah, gentlemen.. bagels on the house! 
JERRY: How was your first day? 
KRAMER: Oh, fantastic!  It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough.   
JERRY: Your hands were in the dough? 
KRAMER: No, I didn't make these bagels.  Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them.  Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test.   
GEORGE: Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here.  
JERRY: Happy Festivus! 
KRAMER: What's Festivus? 
JERRY: When George was growing up.. 
GEORGE:  No! 
JERRY: His father.. 
GEORGE: Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!   
ELAINE: Happy Festivus, Georgie.   
KRAMER: Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific! 
ELAINE: Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message. 
JERRY: You're still trying to gget that free sub? 
ELAINE: Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now. 
JERRY: Is there a captain's hat involved in this? 
ELAINE: Maybe.     
FRANK: Kramer, I got your message. I haven't celebrated Festivus in years! What is your interest? 
KRAMER: Well, just tell me everything, huh? 
FRANK: Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had - but so did another man. As I rained blows opon him, I realized  there had to be another way! 
KRAMER: What happened to the doll? 
FRANK: It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. "A Festivus for the rest of us!" 
KRAMER: That musta been some kind of doll. 
FRANK: She was.       
GEORGE: Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas!  Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you..  
SANDY:  ..Oh.. thanks.    
GEORGE: Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming!  
PHIL: Ow!   
GEORGE: Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir. Merry Christmas!  
KRUGER: Not if you could see our books.. what's this? 
GEORGE: The Human Fund. 
KRUGER: Whatever.  
GEORGE: Exactly.  Erica!       
FRANK: And at the Festivus dinner, you gather your family around, and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year. 
KRAMER: Is there a tree? 
FRANK: No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting. 
KRAMER: Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch. 
FRANK: Let's do it then! Festivus is back! I'll get the pole out of the crawl space.  
ELAINE: Hello, Frank. 
FRANK: Hello, woman.  
ELAINE: Kramer! Kramer.. any word from the vest? 
KRAMER: No.  Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off. 
MANAGER: Hey! I hired you to work during the holidays. This is the holidays. 
KRAMER: But it's Festivus. 
MANAGER: What? 
KRAMER: You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays.. 
MANAGER: That's not a right. 
KRAMER: Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine.  It's a walk out! 
ELAINE: No, I got to stay here and wait for the call. 
KRAMER: What? You're siding with management?! 
ELAINE: No, I just.. 
KRAMER:  Scab! Scab!  Scab!       
GWEN: Hey. 
JERRY: Boy, am I glad to see you. 
GWEN: You were expecting someone else? 
JERRY: You never know. 
GWEN:  You know, you might want to take the tunnel. 
JERRY: So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?   
GWEN: I can go either way. 
JERRY:  You're telling me.     
GEORGE: So, she was switching? Back and forth? 
JERRY: Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there. 
GEORGE: So, just bring her here. This is all you really need. 
JERRY: I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress? 
GEORGE: Lights out. 
JERRY: Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way. 
GEORGE:  Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine! 
JERRY: That's not a french cuff shirt, you know. 
GEORGE: I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener. 
JERRY: Oh, that's classy.   
KRAMER: Well, Happy Festivus. 
GEORGE: What is that? Is taht the pole?! 
FRANK: George, Festivus is your heritage - it's part of who you are. 
GEORGE:  That's why I hate it. 
KRAMER: There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited. 
FRANK: George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes.  
FRANK: Read that poem. 
GEORGE:  I can't read it. I need my glasses! 
FRANK: You don't need glasses, you're just weak! You're weak! 
ESTELLE: Leave him alone! 
FRANK: Alright, George. It's time for the feats of strength.   
GEORGE: No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength!  I hate Festivus! 
FRANK: We had some good times.   
GWEN: Hey. 
JERRY: I there. This is Kramer, and Frank. 
GWEN: Hi. 
KRAMER:  Hello. 
GWEN: So, you ready to go? 
JERRY: Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up.  Now this is a good  looking booth.       
KRAMER: Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels,    
MANAGER:  Lady, if you want a sandwich, I'll make you a sandwich. 
ELAINE:  I want the one that I earned.  I'll get it. I'll get it!  H&H, and Elaine. 
KRAMER:  Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down. 
ELAINE: What did you do? 
KRAMER: You've been warned.   
ELAINE: Oh, hi!    
WORKER: Hey, the steam valve's broke. 
MANAGER: Can we still make bagels? 
WORKER: Sure. It's just a little steamy.   
KRAMER: Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!       
KRUGER: George, I got something for you.  I'm suppose to find a charity and throw some of the company's money at it. They all  seem the same to me, so, what's the difference?  
GEORGE: 20 thousand dollars? 
KRUGER: Made out to the Human Fund.  Oh, damn. I've locked myself out of my office again. Oh well. I'm going home.     
GWEN: Jerry, how many times do we have to come to this.. place? 
JERRY: Why? It's our place. 
GWEN: I just found a rubber band in my soup. 
JERRY: Oh.. I know who's cooking today!   
GEORGE: Hey! Surprise, surprise! 
JERRY: Hey, Georgie! 
GWEN: I think I'm just gonna go. 
JERRY: I'll be here.   
GEORGE:  Hey, soup. 
JERRY: She didn't touch it.   
GEORGE: Ohh.. Paco!  Hey, take a look at this.  
JERRY: 20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this. 
GEORGE: I don't know. 
JERRY: Excuse me? 
GEORGE: I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back. 
JERRY: You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars. 
GEORGE: I'm serious. 
JERRY: You're going to start your own charity? 
GEORGE: I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and  beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time!  .. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver..       
ELAINE: Kramer, the vest just called. 
KRAMER:  Yama - Hama! It's fright night! 
ELAINE: Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card. 
KRAMER: And? 
ELAINE:  Free sub.  I'll see ya. 
KRAMER: Yeah.   
GWEN: Kramer, Hi! 
KRAMER: Oh, hello. 
GWEN: It's Gwen.. We met .. at the coffee shop. 
KRAMER: Ah-huh. 
GWEN: I'm dating your friend, Jerry.. 
KRAMER: Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller. 
GWEN: That's why we're always hiding in that coffee shop! He's afraid of getting caught. 
KRAMER: Oh, he's a tomcat.     
ELAINE: Steve.  
DENIM VEST: Hmm? 
ELAINE: It's Elaine.  
DENIM VEST: From Tim Whatley's party? 
ELAINE: Yeah.  
DENIM VEST: You look.. different. 
ELAINE: I see you're still sticking with the denim.  Do you have that card that I gave you?  
DENIM VEST: Well, I had it back at my place, but I can't go there now.. I'll give it to you later, or something. 
ELAINE: No, no, no. You give me your number.  
DENIM VEST: Okay. Sure.  Do you have the mumps? 
ELAINE: No.  
DENIM VEST: Typhoid? 
ELAINE: No.  
DENIM VEST:  Yama - Hama!   
ELAINE: A fake number! Blimey!     
KRUGER: George, we have a problem. There's a memo, here, from accounting telling me there's no such thing as the Human Fund. 
GEORGE: Well, there could be. 
KRUGER: But there isn't. 
GEORGE: Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here.  
KRUGER: George, I don't get it. If there's no Human Fund, those donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why you gave me a fake  Christmas gift. 
GEORGE: Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus. 
KRUGER: Vemonous? 
GEORGE: Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir! 
KRUGER: Are you making all this up, too? 
GEORGE: Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to. 
KRUGER: Yeah, you probably should.     
GEORGE: Happy Festivus! 
FRANK: George? This is a surprise.  Who's the suit? 
GEORGE: Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger. 
FRANK: Have you seen the pole, Kruger? 
GEORGE: Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole. 
FRANK: He's gonna see it.   
GEORGE: Happy Festivus!  Yama - Hama! 
ELAINE: I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here? 
GEORGE: Embracing my roots. 
JERRY: They nailed you on the 20 G's? 
GEORGE: Busted cold.     
FRANK: It's made from aluminum. Very high strength-to-weight ratio. 
KRUGER: I find your belief system fascinating.     
KRAMER: Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone!  Hee, hee, hee! 
BOOKIE: Hello again, Miss Benes. 
ELAINE: What are you doing here? 
BOOKIE: Damnedest thing.. me and Charlie were calling to ask you out, and, uh, we got this bagel place.. 
KRAMER:  I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!   
ESTELLE: Dinner's ready! 
FRANK: Let's begin.   
KRUGER: Dr.. Van Nostrand? 
KRAMER: Uh.. that's right.   
FRANK: Welcome, new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! And now you're gonna hear  about it! You, Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks! 
GEORGE: Oh, God. 
FRANK:  Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.. I lost my train of thought.   
GWEN: Jerry! 
JERRY: Gwen! How'd you know I was here? 
GWEN: Kramer told me. 
KRAMER: Another Festivus miracle!   
GWEN: I guess this is the ugly girl I've been hearing about. 
ELAINE: Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.   
JERRY: Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah!  Bad lighting on the porch. 
ELAINE:  Hey, how'd my horse do? 
BOOKIE: He had to be shot. 
FRANK: And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength. 
GEORGE: Not the feats of strength.. 
FRANK: This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer. 
KRAMER: Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H. 
JERRY: I thought you were on strike? 
KRAMER: Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little  out there. 
GEORGE: Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?   
KRUGER:  How about George? 
FRANK: Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me, George, Festivus is not over! 
GEORGE: Oh, please, somebody, stop this! 
FRANK:  Let's rumble!   
ESTELLE: I think you can take him, Georgie! 
GEORGE: Oh, come on! Be sensible. 
FRANK: Stop crying, and fight your father! 
GEORGE: Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle! 
FRANK: This is the best Festivus ever!       
MANAGER: Alright. That's enough. You're fired. 
KRAMER: Thank - you!
