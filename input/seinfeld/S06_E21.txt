Jerry: I hear you're going out with David Putty. 
Elaine: Yeah. What, is it a problem? 
Jerry: Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine. 
Elaine: Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a  few years. 
Jerry: Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want  it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than  you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible. 
Elaine: Oh, god. 
Jerry: The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't  see you with a mechanic. 
Elaine: Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all  day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then  they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a  huge turn-off that is. 
Jerry: All right.   
George: Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a  lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays*  the day. 
Estelle: So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish  connoisseur. 
George: You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set.  You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture. 
Estelle: So, I'm getting an eye job. 
George: An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job. 
Estelle: Georgie, I'm a divorcee. 
George: No, you're not a divorcee. Youre just separated. You're---you're  a separatee. 
Estelle: Well, I'm out there, George. 
George: No, you're not out there. 
Estelle: I am, too! 
George: You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And  if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to  electroshock me back into coherence! 
Estelle: Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive  me home because I'll be all drugged up. 
George: Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run--- 
Estelle: This is the only time the doctor *has*.   
George: Kramer, hey, hey!  
Kramer: Hi, little buddy. 
George: Come on over and sit down. 
Kramer: Hey, listen, I gotta go somewhere. 
George: No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun... 
Kramer: All right, I'm sitting down. How are you?  
Estelle: So, Kramer. I'm getting an eye job. 
Kramer: Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're  out  there now. 
George: She's not out there! 
Kramer: So, who is your doctor? 
Estelle: Uh, Bakersoll. 
Kramer: . He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid  from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban. 
George: Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday? 
Kramer: Tuesday? Uh... 
George: Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car  with the bench seats that you like. 
Estelle: Oh, I don't care. 
Kramer: Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to  the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates. 
George: Well, giddy-up!   
Kramer: Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo  Kramer. 
Clerk: Kramer....  All right... 
Kramer: All righty... 
Clerk: Sign right here, please.  
Kramer:  Okay. . Thanks.   Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm  not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake. 
Clerk: What's your name again? 
Kramer: Cosmo Kramer. 
Clerk:  Cosmo Kramer. You *are* the Assman. 
Kramer: No! I'm not the Assman. 
Clerk: Well, as far as the state of New York is concerned, you are.     
David: How do you feel? 
Elaine: Fine. 
David: Something the matter? 
Elaine: No. 
David: Then what is it? 
Elaine: No, nothing.   
Jerry: Hi. 
Elaine: I was with David *Putty* last night. 
Jerry: Yeah, so. 
Elaine: He did the move. 
Jerry: What move? 
Elaine: You know...*the* move. 
Jerry: Wait a second. *My* move?  . 
Jerry: David Putty used *my* move? 
Elaine: Yes, yes. 
Jerry: Are you sure? 
Elaine: Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move. 
Jerry: I can't believe it. He *stole* my move. 
Elaine: What else did you tell  him.  The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat! 
Jerry: Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we  were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex  talk. It's a high-testosterone area. 
Elaine: Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs? 
Jerry: Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it. 
Elaine: Well, wait---wait a second. 
Jerry: What? 
Elaine: Isn't that a little...rash? 
Jerry: No! He stole my move! 
Elaine: Yeah, but...*I* like the move. 
Jerry: Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material. 
Elaine: Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a  pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*! 
Jerry: Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new.  Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His  whole *repertoire* could be lifted. 
Elaine: You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic. 
Jerry: I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.   
Jerry: ...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine. 
George: You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a  move. You know I have no moves, Jerry.  Gimme a  bite. 
Jerry: Can I just get it opened first? 
George: I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing  two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo. 
Jerry: All right, all right. Here. . 
George:  Oh, that's good. That's very good. 
Jerry: You feel better? 
George: Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need  *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during  love-making. 
Jerry: Nancy Klopper? 
George: Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here.  Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All  right, come on, let's have it. 
Jerry: All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure,  before--- 
George: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault. 
Jerry: It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like  this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a  *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used--- 
George: You're gonna tell me...or not. 
Jerry: All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a  headboard. 
George: I got a headboard. 
Jerry: Is it padded? 
George: No. 
Jerry: Good. How tall is she? 
George: Five-foot four. Why? 
Jerry: You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights.  Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck. 
George: I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this. 
Jerry: George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.   
Jerry: Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the  swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great  capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous. 
George: Is it a clockwise swirl? 
Jerry: I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.  . 
Kramer: Here you go, buddy. . 
Jerry: What is it? 
Kramer: *Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone? 
Jerry: When did you do this? 
Kramer: In my spare time. . You know, I'm working on one  of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta  that captures the individual. 
Jerry: Oh... Why Fusilli? 
Kramer: Because *you're* silly. Get it?   Yeah... 
Jerry: Well, thank you very much. 
George: So, did you get your new plates? 
Kramer: Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody  got mine and I got their *vanity* plates. 
George: What do they say? 
Kramer: Assman. 
Jerry: Assman? 
Kramer: Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman! 
Jerry: Who would order a license plate that says "Assman"? 
George: Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's. 
Jerry: It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be  just some guy with a big ass. 
Kramer: Yeah, or it could be a proctologist. 
Jerry: Yeah. Proctologist. 
George: Come on! No doctor would put that on his car. 
Kramer: Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very  good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away.  *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've  ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something  up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in  the same way: "It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one."   
Kramer: Oh! There's my phone.  
George: So, where you gonna stick this  
Jerry: I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.   
Jerry: Hey, David. 
David: Oh, hi, Jerry. 
Jerry: Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move. 
David: What move? 
Jerry: What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on  Elaine. 
David: You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew  you. All you told me about was the ending. 
Jerry: The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing.  You had *nothing*. 
David: Oh, that ending was *so* obvious. I would have figured it out  anyway. I didn't need you to tell me that stupid twist. 
Jerry: Swirl. 
David: Whatever. I don't even do it. 
Jerry: Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*. 
David: Yeah, that's right. 
Jerry: You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples?  You're nothing but a hack. 
David: Are you through, 'cuz, uh, I gotta get back to work. 
Jerry: Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out  of town...okay. But not in the city. 
David: All right, how about the next time your car breaks down, you take  *that* out of town. 
Jerry: Fine. 
David: Good!     
Nancy: Ow, George!  What are you  doing? 
George:  Uh...you  know, uh...pleasuring you. 
Nancy: Well, stop it! 
George: You don't like the move? 
Nancy: No. I don't. 
George: You're kidding. 
Nancy: No, I'm not. It feels like aliens poking at my body. 
George: Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.   
Elaine: Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes! 
David: No, I'm sorry. 
Elaine: What?!! 
David: I can't do the move. 
Elaine: What? 
David: Oh, he's ruined it for me. 
Elaine: Oh, oh, come on, please? 
David: No, he called me a hack. I'm just not into doing it anymore. 
Elaine: Oh, so---so that's it? 
David: I'll come up with some new stuff.   
Kramer: "Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what  you're looking for." .    Dr. Bakersoll: I must caution you about one thing. You can't cry for at  least ten day. You can ruin the operation. 
Estelle: Oh, okay.  Dr. Bakersoll: Now, is someone coming to pick you up? 
Estelle: Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute.    Security Guard: Can I help you? 
Kramer: Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer.  Proctology.  Security Guard: Oh, oh, okay. Sure... 
Kramer: Thanks. Have a good day.   
Kramer: I just can't get over how fantastic you look. 
Estelle: Oh, really? 
Kramer: Oh, yeah. This takes twenty years off. 
Estelle: And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.  . 
Estelle: Did he say "Assman"? 
Kramer: Oh, yeah. 
Estelle: Oh my goodness.   
Kramer: You got that straight! 
Estelle: Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.     
Jerry: You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the  order. Did you close with the swirl? 
George: Supposed to close with the swirl? 
Jerry: Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression  there. I told you to write it down. 
George: Yeah, yeah, should've written it down.   
Jerry: Yeah? 
Buzzer: Elaine. 
Jerry: C'mon up.  You know what? Do me a favor. Don't  even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.   
Jerry: Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred  dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything.  I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye. 
George: What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it  is. He's not gonna cheat you. 
Jerry: Except that it's not Putty. 
George: What happened to Putty? 
Jerry: Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other  place. I think they might be trying to screw me. 
George: Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think?  That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. "By the  way, you need a new Johnson rod in there." "Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well,  you better put one of those on."   
Jerry: Hey, Elaine. 
Elaine: Yeah, yeah, hello. 
Jerry: Is it something I said? 
Elaine: Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore. 
Jerry: Really? 
Elaine: Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing. 
Jerry: What is it? 
Elaine: Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's  like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*. 
Jerry: Huh. 
Elaine: I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of  my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me,  when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing! 
George: Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle  involved in any way? 
Elaine: Yes. As a matter of fact, there is. 
George: I think that's mine. 
Elaine: I'm not surprised. 
Jerry: Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're  gonna see him? 
Elaine: Why? 
Jerry: You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is  trying to screw me. 
Elaine: An estimate? How am I supposed to do that? 
Jerry: Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just  kind of bring it up at the right time and find out.  
Elaine:  What? What is this? 
Jerry: That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry. 
Elaine: Fusilli Jerry? 
Jerry: Yeah. Kramer made it. 
George: All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.   
Jerry: Hey, Assman! 
Kramer: Hey, well, this is Sally. 
Sally: Hello. 
Jerry: Hi. 
Elaine: Hi. 
Kramer: Shall we go? 
Sally: Okay.      
Estelle: You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself. 
Frank: You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out with a  dumbbell yesterday. I feel *vigorous*. 
Estelle: Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do. 
Frank: I got things to do, too. 
Estelle: Don't upset me! I can't cry! 
Frank: Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh? 
Estelle: Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me. 
Frank: Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy. 
Estelle: I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab. 
Frank: He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him!   
Elaine: Hey, let me ask you a question. 
David: Sure. 
Elaine: What do you charge for blown shocks? 
David: What? 
Elaine: Two, three hundred? 
David: I don't know. Maybe five hundred. 
Elaine: Ah.   
Elaine: What about a bad gasket? 
David: Bad gasket? 
Elaine: Yeah. Like a terrible gasket. 
David: What is all this? 
Elaine: Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do. 
David: What kind of car is it? 
Elaine: Oh...any kind of---of a Swedish car. 
David: All together, that could run about sixteen hundred. 
Elaine: Oh.   
Elaine: Is that with the parts and labor? 
David: Uh-huh. 
Elaine: Hmm.   
Elaine: Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....   
Nancy: Wow. That was...*great*. I mean...*wow*. 
George: It just came to me. 
Nancy: I---I've never in my life have---have I---. What was that? 
George: You mean in the end? 
Nancy: Uh-huh. 
George: A counter-clockwise swirl.   
Nancy: What's that? 
George: What? 
Nancy: On---on your hand? Let me see what's on your hand. 
George: Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt. 
Nancy: Give me that.  I wanna see what's on your hand.   
Nancy: Number one. Take her leg.... Oh, my god! Crib notes? You've got  crib notes?!! 
George: It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all. 
Nancy: Oh, my god, you're sick.  
George: You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!   
Frank: Assman? I'll get him, Assman!   
Jerry: Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me  off. 
Elaine: So what are you going to do? 
Jerry: Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this. 
Elaine: Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore? 
Jerry: Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know  what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.   
Jerry: Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...? 
Frank: Where's your friend Kramer? 
Jerry: I don't know. Why? 
Frank: Because I'm looking for him. That's why. He stopped short. 
Jerry: What do you mean? 
Frank: In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't know  what that's about? That's my old move! I used it on Estelle forty years  ago! I told everybody about it! Everybody knows!  Hmmph! I  stopped short. 
Jerry: Really, stopping short. That's a good move. 
Frank: You're not kidding it's a good move!   
Kramer: Hey. 
Jerry: Hey. 
Kramer: Hey, Frank. 
Frank: Don't Frank me! I know what you did. How dare you stop short with  my wife! 
Kramer: C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking about.   
Frank: You think I don't know, Assman?!! To think I almost split the  profits on the Manssierre with you. 
Kramer: Bro. 
Frank: Manssierre! 
Kramer: Bro! 
Frank: Manssierre! You...!   
Frank: Aah!!! 
Jerry: Oh, my god!     
Jerry: If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it. 
Elaine: Me either. 
George: They say this guy's the best. 
Jerry: He had to use cork-screw pasta.   
Kramer: Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.   
Kramer: The name on the boat. Look at it. 
Jerry: Assman! 
Kramer: Yeah , he's the Assman! Jerry,  *he's* the Assman!   
Doctor: Which one is the son? 
George:  I am. 
Doctor: Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want you to know that this won't  take long. And he's going to be fine.   
Kramer: Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the  wrong license plates?  Dr. Cooperman: Yes. I'm still waiting for the motor vehicle bureau to  straighten it out. 
Kramer: So...you're the Assman.   
Frank: It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.   
Estelle: Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! I've  been waiting for hours! 
Frank: I fell on some Fusilli. 
Estelle: Fusilli? 
Frank: You know, the corkscrew pasta. It was a Fusilli Jerry. It got stuck  in me. Had to go to the proctologist. 
Estelle: The proctologist? Are you okay? 
Frank: Yeah. 
Estelle: Oh, I was so worried.  
George: Ma, don't cry! 
Estelle: Oh, I can't help it! 
George: Ma, your eyes! 
Estelle: Oh!
