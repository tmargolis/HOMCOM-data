JERRY:  Let me ask you a question. 
ELAINE: Mm-hm. 
JERRY: You're a hostage, captured by terrorists- 
ELAINE:  Who, me? 
JERRY: You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing  the laundry? 
ELAINE:  They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention. 
KRAMER:  You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!   
KRAMER: Hey, Georgie.  JERRY AND ELAINE: Hi.   
JERRY:  What's the matter? 
GEORGE:  My mother caught me. 
JERRY: "Caught" you? Doing what? 
GEORGE: You know.  I was alone.. 
ELAINE:  You mean..?! 
GEORGE:  Uh-huh. 
KRAMER:  She caught you?   
JERRY: Where? 
GEORGE:  ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed  to be working.  My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it.. 
JERRY: "Glamour"?   
GEORGE: ..So, one thing lead to another.. 
JERRY: So, what did she do? 
GEORGE: First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it. 
KRMAER:  Man.. 
GEORGE: I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up. 
JERRY: What did you do? 
GEORGE: I zipped up! 
ELAINE:  So, she fell? 
GEORGE: Yeah.  Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was! 
ELAINE: No, I guess you couldn't have.. 
JERRY:  No, I wouldn't think so. 
ELAINE:  ..done that. 
GEORGE: So, she fell, and then she started screaming, "My back! My back!" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital. 
ELAINE:  How is she? 
GEORGE:  She's in traction. 
ELAINE:  Ok, I'm sorry. 
GEORGE: It's not funny, Elaine. 
ELAINE:  I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious. 
GEORGE: Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George, why?!".. I said, "Because it's  there!"   
JERRY: "Glamour"?   
GEORGE:  Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again. 
ELAINE: What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together? 
GEORGE:  All together.   
ELAINE: Oh, gimme a break.. 
JERRY:  Ohhh yeah.. right. 
KRAMER: Oh, like you're gonna stop?  JERRY AND ELAINE: C'mon.. 
GEORGE: You don't think I can? 
JERRY: No chance. 
GEORGE:  You think you could? 
JERRY: Well, I know I could hold out longer than you. 
GEORGE: Care to make it interesting? 
JERRY: Sure, how much? 
GEORGE: A hundred dollars. 
JERRY:  You're on. 
KRAMER:  Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this.  
JERRY: You? 
KRAMER: Yeah. 
JERRY: You'll be out before we get the check. 
ELAINE:  I want to be in on this, too.  GEORGE AND JERRY:  Ohh, no. No, no, no.. 
ELAINE: Why? 
JERRY:  It's apples and oranges.. 
ELAINE: What? Why?  Why? 
JERRY: Because you're a woman! 
ELAINE: So what? 
JERRY: It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man. 
ELAINE:  Oh. 
JERRY: We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving. 
ELAINE: Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs. 
KRAMER:  Not everyday. 
GEORGE: Alright, look, you want to be in? 
ELAINE: Yeah! 
GEORGE: You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars. 
KRAMER: No, a thousand! 
ELAINE: No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty. 
GEORGE: Alright, you're in for one-fifty. 
JERRY:  Okay, one-fifty. 
GEORGE: Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing? 
JERRY: Well, obviously, we all know each other very well,  I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system. 
KRAMER: Alright.          
GEORGE:  No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course  I'm gonna come by. Alright.  My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?!  Because she caught me?  You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist..  
JERRY:  ..Yeah? 
GEORGE:  Whatever.   
JERRY: How is she? 
GEORGE:  She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight. 
JERRY:  Yeah? 
ELAINE: It's me. 
JERRY: Come on up.  
GEORGE: Hey, what are you doing tonight? 
JERRY:  Dating Marla. 
GEORGE: Oh, the virgin? 
JERRY: Yeah. 
GEORGE: Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest? 
JERRY: Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.   
KRAMER: Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street.   
JERRY: Where? 
KRAMER: Second floor from the top.  See the window on the left? 
GEORGE:  Wow! 
JERRY:  Who walks around the house like that?!   
GEORGE:  Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people.. 
KRAMER: ..Yeah..  yeah..  
JERRY: Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room? 
GEORGE: I would imagine it's all naked. 
JERRY: What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too? 
GEORGE:  They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops.  One big nude-a-rama.   
ELAINE: Hey.  JERRY AND GEORGE:  Hey. 
ELAINE: Well,  where's my money? Who caved? 
JERRY:  Not me. 
GEORGE:  Not me. 
ELAINE: What're you looking at? 
JERRY: There's a naked woman across the street. 
ELAINE:  This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life.  So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics  class. I'm gonna go tonight. 
JERRY:  Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back. 
ELAINE:  So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin'  to Mars. 
JERRY:  Uh-huh. 
GEORGE: Have a good time.   
KRAMER:  I'm out!   
ELAINE: What?! 
KRAMER: Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest. 
GEORGE: You're out?! 
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah..  what? 
ELAINE: Well, that was fast! 
JERRY: Well, it was that woman across the street.  You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next.    
ELAINE: ..And then there were three.       
ELAINE: I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find  my son treating his body like it was an amusement park! 
GEORGE:  Ma. 
ESTELLE: Don't give me "Ma". It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open. 
GEORGE: Ma, people can hear you. 
ESTELLE:  Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of  people could watch you! You could be a big star! 
GEORGE:  Alright, Ma, that's enough! 
ESTELLE: I want you to go see a psychiatrist. 
GEORGE: No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist! 
ESTELLE: Why? Why not?! Why won't you go? 
GEORGE:  Because I don't want to. 
ESTELLE: I want you to go see somebody. 
GEORGE: Well, I am not going. 
ESTELLE: It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.   
SHELLY: Hello, Aunt Estelle. Look at you - how did this happen? 
GEORGE:  Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?!   
NURSE: Hi, Denise. Six-thirty, time for your sponge bath.   
DENISE: Mmm.. is it six-thirty already? I fell asleep.   
SHELLY:  So, George, what are you doing now? I hear you got some kinda television, writing - thing? 
GEORGE:  Yeah.. television.   
NURSE: Let me help you out with that. Here, just slip it over your head.. 
DENISE: Oh.. thank you. 
SHELLY:  Well, it's about time. We thought you were gonna wind up on the street.   What is it you're doing, exactly?   
ESTELLE: George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you!       
JOYCE: So, when was the last time you took a class? 
ELAINE: Oh, it's been a while. 
JOYCE:  Are you psyched? 
ELAINE:  Yeah. yeah, I'm really.. psyched. 
JOYCE: Well, you're gonna thank me for getting you in here. 
ELAINE: Why is that? 
JOYCE:  See the guy with the dark hair and the red shorts?   
ELAINE:  Oh, my God.  John F. Kennedy Junior's here! 
JOYCE: He's gonna be in your class today. 
ELAINE:  In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?! 
JOYCE: I can get you a spot right behind him. He has got a great butt. 
ELAINE: Yeah. Butt. Butt. Great butt. John-John's butt.       
MARLA: Let's slow it down a little. 
JERRY: "Slow it down"? 
MARLA: Well,  You know.. 
JERRY: Ah, yeah.. I know. 
MARLA: You're okay with that, right? 
JERRY: Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me.  I don't  care about that. 
MARLA: So, I'll see you Saturday night, then? 
JERRY:  Sure, Saturday night. 
MARLA: Alright, then. Good night. 
JERRY: Goodnight.  Not just a good night - a great night.              
KRAMER:  Goood Moorrrnninng! 
JERRY:  Yeah, good morning. 
KRAMER: Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time.  
JERRY: She's not there. She's doin' her wash. 
KRAMER:  Oh. So, did you make it through the night? 
JERRY:  Yes, I'm proud to say I did! 
KRAMER: So, you're still master of your domain. 
JERRY:  Yes. Yes I am.  Master of my domain. But I will tell you this: I am going over to  her apartment, and  I'm tellin' her to put those shades down! 
KRAMER: Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say? 
JERRY: I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in  this contest - something's gotta give! 
KRAMER: Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?!  This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to  stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it. 
JERRY:  Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way. 
KRAMER:  No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our  bedroom windows, we would think: "Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off?" And now that wish's come true, and you want to  throw it away?! 
JERRY: Look, I'm sorry- 
KRAMER: No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry. 
JERRY: Kramer,  get outta my way! 
KRAMER:  No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much!  Now, come on. Please, Jerry. Please! I'm  beggin' ya! Please!  Come on! Please!   
JERRY: Alright..  
KRAMER: Yes! 
JERRY: ..Alright. 
KRAMER:  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  
JERRY: She's not there! 
KRAMER: Oh, I can wait..       
JERRY: So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath? 
GEORGE: Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient..  I was going nuts. 
JERRY: Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital. 
GEORGE:  Well, my mother, Jerry..   
JERRY:  But are you still master of your domain? 
GEORGE:  I am king of the county. You? 
JERRY: Lord of the manor.   
ELAINE: John F. Kennedy Jun-ya! 
JERRY: What? 
ELAINE:  He was in my aerobics class. 
JERRY: Really? Did you talk to him? 
ELAINE: No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at  the exact same moment, and he says to me,  "Quite a workout." 
GEORGE: "Quite a workout"? What did you say? 
ELAINE:  I said, "yeah." 
JERRY:  Good one. 
ELAINE: So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out.  So we're walkin' and  talkin', and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me: "Do you wanna split a cab uptown?"  And I said, "Sure" - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior  we're talkin' about!  So, then, he says to me, "Where do you live?" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he  dropped me off in front,  and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house..  Oh, God.. 
JERRY: But the question is, are you still master of your domain? 
ELAINE:  I'm queen of the castle.        
ESTELLE: You're back. 
GEORGE: Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit. 
ESTELLE: I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this. 
GEORGE: You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you? 
ESTELLE: You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a  sandwich.. 
GEORGE:  You got it, Ma.  A little later.  
ESTELLE:  Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak. 
GEORGE: Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference? 
ESTELLE: I don't understand why you can't do this for me! 
GEORGE:  I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a little time with you. 
ESTELLE: But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over! 
GEORGE: Ten minutes! Here, here,  Have some Tic-Tacs. 
ESTELLE: Get the hell outta here.  I'm sorry you came.   
NURSE:  Six-thirty. Time for your sponge bath.   
ESTELLE: George.. I'm huuunnnggry! 
GEORGE:  Hang on, Ma.. hang on..       
JOYCE: Hi! 
ELAINE: Hi. 
JOYCE: Did you get your hair done today? 
ELAINE: No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit.  
JOYCE: You know who - isn't here. He was in the early class today.  But I think you made quite an impression on him yesterday. 
ELAINE:  What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression? 
JOYCE: Let me just put this back.    
ELAINE: No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?! 
JOYCE:  He asked about you. 
ELAINE:  He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?!  What did he say? 
JOYCE: He wanted to know your situation. 
ELAINE:  What situation? I have a situation? 
JOYCE: I-I told him you were single. 
ELAINE: That was good. That was very good. 
JOYCE: He said you were just his type. 
ELAINE:  Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me. 
JOYCE: He also told me to tell you that he'll be in your neighborhood tomorrow around nine o' clock - so he's gonna stop in front of your building if you want to  come down and say hello.         
JERRY: Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent,  wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye.  
KRAMER:  Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there..  It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed.. that's good, that's good.. yes, yes, yes.. 
JERRY:  The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The  wheels on the bus..   
KRAMER: The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on..               
GEORGE: All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee? 
JERRY: I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside!  Yeah?! 
ELAINE:  It's Elaine. 
JERRY:  Come on up!  
GEORGE: Where did you get those socks? 
JERRY: I don't know. 
GEORGE: I think those are my socks! 
JERRY: How are these your socks?! 
GEORGE: I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore! 
JERRY:  Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to  have them! 
GEORGE: Yeah, well, they're my socks! 
JERRY: They're my socks!   
GEORGE: Oh boy.. 
JERRY: What are we doing here.. 
GEORGE: ..Oh boy. 
JERRY: This is ridiculous. 
GEORGE: Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting. 
JERRY: I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody. 
GEORGE: Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.   
ELAINE: Hello..  
GEORGE:  You caved?! 
JERRY: It's over? 
GEORGE: You're out? 
JERRY: Ohh-my-God. The Queen is dead.   
GEORGE: I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring. 
JERRY: What happened? 
ELAINE: It was..uh.. John-John.  JERRY AND GEORGE: Ohhhhh.. John-John. 
JERRY: But you made it through the day before. 
ELAINE: Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight. 
JERRY: Why outside here? 
ELAINE: Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.   
JERRY: Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me. 
GEORGE: And then,  there were two. 
ELAINE:  Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior..       
MARLA: Let's go in the bedroom. 
JERRY: Really? 
MARLA: Yes. 
JERRY: You sure? 
MARLA: Yes. 
JERRY: You really want to? 
MARLA: I do. I'm ready. 
JERRY: Okay.. 
MARLA: I know how difficult this must have been for you. 
JERRY:  You don't know the half of it.   
MARLA: What do you mean? 
JERRY: Well, it's kinda silly, but..   
MARLA: Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends? 
JERRY: No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother- 
MARLA: I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind.     
ELAINE: Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you- 
MARLA: I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends.  Ooohh, get away from me! You're horrible.  Horrible! All of you!     
ELAINE: What happened? 
JERRY: I told her about the contest. 
ELAINE: Ohh. Boy, she's a whack-o.   
GEORGE:  Hey, what happened? 
ELAINE: What? 
GEORGE: I thought you were meeting Kennedy. 
ELAINE:  He didn't show. 
GEORGE: Yeah, he did. 
ELAINE: What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go.. 
GEORGE: No, no, no. He just left. 
ELAINE: What? 
GEORGE: Yeah, he was talking to Marla. 
JERRY: Marla? 
GEORGE: Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away. 
ELAINE:  He left with Marla, the virgin? 
GEORGE: Yeah. 
ELAINE: They drove away? 
GEORGE: Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's- 
JERRY:  Oh my God in heaven!   
ELAINE:  Is that..? 
GEORGE: Kramer?!   
ELAINE: He's waving..         
MARLA: Ohh, John. That was wonderful..
