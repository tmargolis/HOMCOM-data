Jerry: Why?   
Kramer: Cause I’m getting rid of it.         
Jerry: YEAH?    
Bania:    
Jerry: ALL RIGHT, COME ON UP    
Kramer:  So ...   
Jerry: Well, well, why are you getting rid of your refrigerator?    
Kramer: Well after that Kidney Stone I only want fresh food. It's gotta be fresh. I’m not eating any more stored food. Plus you know I want the space.   
Jerry: Well, what for?   
Kramer: Well I could put a, dresser in there. I could get dressed while I’m making breakfast.      
Bania: Hey  Here you go.    
Jerry: Yeah.   
Bania: You didn’t think I was really going to give you a suit, did you?

Kramer: No, you'll never get a better deal than that.   
Bania: All right. I’ll leave you alone.    
Jerry: Yeah, I’ll see you.   
Kramer: All right, ooh look at that Armani, huh, yeah.      
Jerry: Yeah, that's a deal. That's a horrible deal. I don't want to go out to dinner with him. I’d rather make my own suit.      
George: I did it! It's all done!   
Jerry: Hey.    
George: I did it. Hunh, we're going out as soon as she gets off of work and it'll still be daytime. You know I, I’m much better in the daytime then I am at night. it's less pressure.

Elaine: You know I, I have to say, I've never admitted this to anyone, but um, I kind of like airline food.    
Simon: That's probably because of ...    
Elaine: What?   
Simon: What?   
Elaine: Yeah, what?   
Simon:    
Elaine: What?   
Simon: Where I come from, we don't say “What?” It's proper to say “Pardon?”

Elaine: Nothing.     New scene.  Beautiful aerial shot of Central Park and part of the city  -- looks to be a beautiful autumn day. Then to the waitress  and George strolling along a path in the park. Each has a coat on and their hands are in their pockets.   
Kelly: So then about a year ago I started selling, these funky little hair clips. It's going pretty good. I make them in my apartment.      
Kelly: I’m just doing this waitress thing for a while, because I wanted to go to Europe this summer and I could use a few extra ... Careful    
George: Oh. It's just horse manure  Horse manure's not that bad. I don't even mind the word “manure.” You know, it's, it's “nure,” which is good. and a “ma” in front of it. MA-NURE. When you consider the other choices, “manure” is actually pretty refreshing.      
Kelly: That's a nice watch George.   
George: Yeah.   
Kelly: You know, my boyfriend has the same one.   
George: Huh. Really?   
Kelly: Yeah, he loves watches. He's a real watch freak.   
George: Well, how about that?   
Kelly: Ooh look out.  You stepped right in it.   
George: Yes, I sure did.      New scene.  Exterior of Jerry's brick apartment building with the staircase - then inside where George and Jerry are talking.

Jerry: Boy, It's the way they just slip that in there too.   
George: Yeah, like it's just part of the conversation. “Oh my boyfriend really likes watches. He's a real watch freak.” Well that's fabulous.    
Jerry: Well let me ask you this. What exactly did you say when you asked her out?   
George: I said, “would you like to go for a walk or something.”   
Jerry: Oh, a walk, well --   
George: Or something. I said, “Or Something!”   
Jerry: Or something. Yeah, that's a date.   
George:  There you go.   
Jerry: You know there is always the possibility, that she called an audible.   
George: What do you mean?   
Jerry: Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didn’t like the looks of the defense and changed the play.   
George: I think things were going ok. We were having a nice conversation.   
Jerry: Uh huh.   
George: I mentioned how I liked horse manure.   
Jerry: You did?   
George: Yeah.   
Jerry: Yeah. You said you liked horse manure.   
George: Yeah. You know, about how when you break it down, it's really a very positive thing. you know, you have a “nure,” with a “ma” in front of it. MA-NURE. It's not bad.   
Jerry: And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend?   
George: Yeah.  ... Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it.   
Jerry: I’m just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure.   
George: So you don't think she really has a boyfriend?   
Jerry: My honest opinion, I think she made it up.   
George: Well then she's just a Liar, Isn't she?      
Kramer: Hey.   
Jerry: Well ... you want something to eat, don't you?   
Kramer: Ahh, no, no, no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself of things. It's fun. Very monastic.

Kramer: It's all fresh. Fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. I buy it, I omniga nominga, I eat it.   
Jerry: Well I’m glad it's working out.   
Kramer: Oh yeah, it's working out. And I got a date with that waitress that works at Reggie’s.   
Jerry: Boy, if i could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place.   
Kramer: Yeah, well, I’ll tell you, she's a full-figured gal.   
Jerry: Is she?   
Kramer: Oh you better believe it buddy. Hey George, we could double sometime.   
George: Yeah, yeah, yeah we could. You know, ah, Kramer, the next time you talk to her, find out if she knows Kelly, from Monk's. I wanna know if she really has a boyfriend.   
Kramer: All right it's done.         
Jerry: Hello?   
Bania: Hi, Jerry. It's Kenny.

Jerry: Yeah, you wanna get that meal, don't you?   
Bania: How about Mendy’s, ooh, ever been there?

Jerry: I’ll have the salmon.   
Waiter: And you?   
Bania: Ahh, you know what I think. I’m just going to have soup. Yeah, I’ll save the meal for another time.   
Jerry: Another time? What other time?   
Bania: I had a hot dog earlier. I’m not that hungry.   
Jerry: No, no, Bania, no. This is the dinner. The soup counts.   
Bania: Soup's not a meal. You're supposed to buy me a meal.   
Jerry: I’m not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything you want.   
Bania: I don't want anything but soup.   
Jerry: Then that's the meal.   
Bania: But I had the hot dog.   
Jerry: I didn’t tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have a hot dog?

Jerry: I don't know? Consomm or something.   
Elaine: Consomm, hmm.   
Jerry: What?   
Elaine: Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean if he had gotten Chicken Gumbo, or Matzah Ball, or Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hardy soups.   
Jerry: Elaine you're missing the whole point.   
Elaine: What?   
Jerry: The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, its a meal.   
Elaine: Was it a cup or a bowl?   
Jerry: You see -- ah, uh ...   
Elaine: I’m just curious.   
Jerry: A bowl, ok?   
Elaine: Did he crumble any crackers in it?      
Elaine:  Did he crumble, any crackers in it?   
Jerry: As a mater of fact, he did.

Jerry: Well, I have some money. What do you need?    
Simon: Well, 20 should cover me.  Thanks mate.

Jerry: I’ll have an egg white omelet.      
George: What's it gonna be? ... You hear that?   
Jerry: Yeah, that was bad.   
George: Did you feel that tension? We use to have banter -  - there's no more banter.      
Jerry: Oh, no, it's Kenny. Slide out so he can't sit down.    
Bania: Hey.

Jerry: ... Oh, I’m joking.   
Bania: OH! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Can I squeeze in?    
George: Sure you can.      Kelly the 
Waitress: Can I take your order?   
Bania: What kind of soup do you have?   
Jerry: Why don't you get a sandwich?   
Bania: Ok, I’ll have tomato soup and ah, tuna on toast.   
Jerry: OK ...  This is it ‘cha know      
Jerry: This is the meal ... so stock up buddy boy.   
Bania: What are you talking about? this isn't a meal.      
Jerry: Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal.

Jerry: Doesn't matter, This is it. This completes the transaction

Simon: Hey mate. Fancy a beer?   
Jerry: Ah, no thanks.         
Jerry:  Hello? No, I’m sorry Bania ... I’m not going over this again. Well who told you to order soup? ... No! There's no dinner. There's not going to be any dinner. You've had a sandwich and 2 bowls of soup and that's it. Good-bye.      
Jerry: Hey, what size suit are you?   
Simon: 40.   
Jerry: 40. Perfect. Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?

George: I can't go in there. I feel too uncomfortable.   
Jerry: Oh, what are you saying? So we're not going to go in there anymore?
