JERRY: Thank you! Goodnight!  
SALLY: Jerry! 
JERRY:  Hey. Hey! 
SALLY:  Sally Weaver!  Susan Ross' roommate from college.. hello!  
JERRY: Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show? 
SALLY: Saw it? I loved it! And thank you for the free tickets. You are so funny. 
JERRY:  Oh, thanks. 
SALLY:  No, no, I mean it. You're very funny. 
JERRY:  I believe you. 
SALLY: Oh, anyway, let me show you Memphis. I am taking you  out to dinner. 
JERRY:  Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport. 
SALLY: Ohh.. that's too bad.. Susan thought we'd really get along - I guess because we're both wacko!  You know what, um..  You have to give this to them for me. Okay? Here.  It's a wedding present. 
JERRY: Oh? 
SALLY: And Jerry? Be careful with it, okay? Be very careful. 
JERRY: Uh-huh.      
FRANK: George, as you may be aware, your mother and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida. 
GEORGE:  I am aware. 
FRANK: So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor? 
GEORGE: A billiard parlor? 
FRANK: Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity..   
GEORGE: Well, that's.. Elaine! 
ELAINE: Oh, hi, Frank. 
GEORGE:  Sit down. Join us, please. 
ELAINE:  Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing. 
GEORGE:  Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down. 
ELAINE:  Okay..  So..  Frank, did George ever show you that photo? 
GEORGE:  What photo? 
ELAINE: You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said "Costanza"? 
FRANK:  There's a Costanza in Tuscany?  Did he look like me? Did you talk to him? 
ELAINE: I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it. 
FRANK: I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo. 
ELAINE: Who is that? 
GEORGE:  When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind. 
FRANK: I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated. 
ELAINE: So, you weren't born here? 
FRANK: No. That's why I can never be president.. It always irked me. That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse to vote.  They don't want me, I don't want them! 
GEORGE: I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas- 
FRANK:  Don't bring me down.  Do you have another copy of that photo? 
ELAINE: No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might. 
FRANK: The Maestro? What Maestro? 
ELAINE: He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him. 
GEORGE: Really? Why? 
ELAINE:  Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars. 
GEORGE: Who? 
ELAINE: You know the Three Tenors? 
GEORGE: Yeah..  Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy. 
ELAINE:  The other guy.      
STEWARDESS:  Could I take that box for you? 
JERRY: Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it. 
STEWARDESS: Oh, then, I'll have to put your bag in the over-head. 
JERRY: Oh, okay..   
STEWARDESS: There we go.        
JERRY: Ohh.. look at this.. 
KRAMER: What? 
JERRY: I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this  stupid thing. 
KRAMER: Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce.. 
JERRY: I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin. 
KRAMER:  I see.. 
JERRY: No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show. 
KRAMER: Well, why don't you do your material? 
JERRY: I'm out. 
KRAMER:  Well, you better get to work. 
JERRY:  Thanks for the tip.   
GEORGE: Hey, buddies. 
JERRY: Hey. Hey, this is for you.  It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally. 
GEORGE: Oh yeah..  Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off. 
JERRY:  Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box.  What the hell are you doing? 
KRAMER:  I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you?    
JERRY:  Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on. 
KRAMER:  Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam? 
JERRY: Like what? 
KRAMER: Well, uh..  "What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?" 
JERRY:  Where's the punchline? 
KRAMER: It's all attitude..  
GOERGE:  Well, this is certainly a crappy gift.. 
JERRY: A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?! 
GEORGE: Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express. 
JERRY: Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?! 
KRAMER: Look, it's personalized.  "The Costanzas" 
GEORGE: No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it. 
KRAMER: Well, maybe your father would be interested in that. 
GEORGE: I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom. 
KRAMER:  Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..      
KRAMER: So, what's your game? What do you like to play? 
FRANK: Eight ball. 
KRAMER: No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight pool.. hmm? 
FRANK: You like to gamble, Cosmo? 
KRAMER: Yeah, now and then - you know how it is.. 
FRANK: Five dollars a game, huh? 
KRAMER: I'll break. 
FRANK: Okay.        
GEORGE: What's all this? 
SUSAN: Oh, I'm just moving in some more of my stuff. 
GEORGE:  More stuff.. 
SUSAN:  Oh, I put up my doll collection..   
GEORGE: Oh my God! What is that?! 
SUSAN:  What? What is it? 
GEORGE:  This doll  looks like my mother. 
SUSAN: George, it's a doll. 
GEORGE: I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother! 
SUSAN:  Oh, get outta here..      
ESTELLE: What's going on in here?  Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours! 
FRANK: We still haven't finished the first game. 
ESTELLE: The first game?! 
KRAMER:  Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table. 
FRANK:  he knows the Maestro. He could have the picture.. 
ESTELLE: Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin. 
FRANK:  You don't know that!  We're gonna go see him, huh? 
KRAMER:  As soon as the game is over.. 
FRANK:  Oh boy. 
KRAMER: Eleven, corner pocket.       
GEORGE: What is this thing doing here? 
SUSAN: Oh, I used to love to sleep with my dolls when I was a little girl..   
GEORGE: Uh, I'm sorry, I can't do this.. 
SUSAN: Why? 
GEORGE: I feel like I'm in bed with my mother. 
SUSAN: Oh, stop it.        
JERRY: Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent. 
ELAINE:  Oh yeah? 
JERRY: Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist! 
ELAINE:  Oh, that's dynamite. 
JERRY: Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show? 
ELAINE: Who else is on the show? 
JERRY: Uh.. one of the three tenors. 
ELAINE:  The Three Tenors?  Which one?! 
JERRY: Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo.. 
ELAINE:  The other guy?! 
JERRY:  Yeah, the other guy. 
ELAINE:  My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show! 
JERRY: Why? 
ELAINE: Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph? 
JERRY: Why not? 
ELAINE:  Wow! The other guy!   
JERRY: Hey, you look awful. 
GEORGE:  I'm on no sleep, bro. 
JERRY: Problem in the bedroom? 
GEORGE:  Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it.   
JERRY: Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night? 
GEORGE:  ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky.  It's freakin' me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat. 
JERRY: I thought you didn't want the doormat. 
GEORGE: I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow. 
JERRY: Sally?  Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York? 
GEORGE: Yeah,  Susan said you'd be excited. 
JERRY: Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?! 
ELAINE: Who's Sally? 
GEORGE: Susan's college roommate. 
JERRY: It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show. 
GEORGE: So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you. 
JERRY:  I will - don't worry.  In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap! 
ELAINE: That's sounds pretty juvenile. 
JERRY:  Hey! A dinosaur!      
FRANK: His name was Carlo Costanza. We played together everyday until I was four. If I could just look through your photographs, maybe I could recognize him. 
MAESTRO: Unfortunately those photographs are at home. 
KRAMER: Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room. 
FRANK:  Yes, It's, uh, it's.. uh, uh.. What do you call it, Kramer? 
KRAMER: A billiard room. 
FRANK: No, not billiard..  Not billiards.. it was.. Come on, already. Come on.. 
KRAMER:  What? 
FRANK: We call it.. the, uh.. 
KRAMER:  The Place To Be! 
FRANK: The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be. 
MAESTRO:  Ah, then I shall be there. And now, Gentlemen,  if you will excuse me - I must prepare for the symphony. 
KRAMER: Oh, yeah?   
MAESTRO:  Ohh, my pants.  It's an old conductor's trick I learned from Leonard Bernstein. 
KRAMER: Really? 
MAESTRO: You keep a perfect crease by not sitting in them before the performance.   
KRAMER: That's good thinking.      
GEORGE: You see?.. You see?! 
JERRY: Well, it doesn't look exactly like her. 
GEORGE: Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years! 
JERRY: Why don't you just get rid of it? 
GEORGE: I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming.  Susan's so attached to this thing. 
JERRY: Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.   
GEORGE: Hi, Elaine.   
ELAINE: Did you see that?! 
JERRY: I'm just glad it's outta here.  What's that?  
ELAINE: Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors. 
JERRY: Oh.  Yeah? 
SALLY:  It's Sally. 
JERRY: Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce? 
SALLY: A whole case. 
JERRY:  Excellent.  So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about? 
ELAINE:  No. 
JERRY: How come? I told you - It's fantastic. 
ELAINE: Eh, I like mine. 
JERRY: I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me? 
ELAINE: I don't want it. 
JERRY:  I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better. 
ELAINE:  It doesn't matter to me.   
JERRY: Come in.   
SALLY:  Well, here I am! 
JERRY: Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally. 
ELAINE: Hi. 
JERRY: How was your flight?  Pretty uncomfortable? 
SALLY:  Actually, the seat next to me was empty, so, there was no problem at all. 
JERRY:  Oh..  Oh, wait..  This isn't the sauce that I asked for! 
SALLY: That's right. It's a special gourmet sauce. "The Pride of Memphis!" 
JERRY:  No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin! 
SALLY: This is much better. And frankly, in Memphis, we think that other sauce as  kind of a joke. 
JERRY: I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing.  Nothing! 
SALLY: You could just do your material. 
JERRY:  I don't have any material! 
ELAINE:  He's got nothin'!      
DOLL: Georgie! Don't eat with your hands!  Why do you eat so fast?! You can't even taste it! 
GEORGE:  Don't tell me how to eat!   
DOLL: You're wearing that shirt? You've had it for five years already! Why don't you get a new shirt?! 
GEORGE:  Because I like this one!  C'mon, let's go. Let's go!  Oh, hi..  
WOMAN:  That man should really be in a sanitarium.       
KRAMER: Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain perfectly creased. 
FRANK: It's him!  It's Carlo Costanza! 
KRAMER: Come on. Are you sure?   
FRANK: I'd know him anywhere. 
MAESTRO: I've seen that man in Tuscany. Eccentric fellow. Reputation of being kind of a village idiot. 
FRANK: I still say we're related. 
MAESTRO:  Ohh, I love this piece.  
KRAMER: Alright, come on Frank. It's your shot. 
FRANK:  I can't make anything.. 
KRAMER:  Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly. 
FRANK: Follow through? What do you mean? 
KRAMER: Right here, come on, I'll show you..  Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly..   
FRANK: It's a little unnatural, but I think I'm getting the hang of it. 
ESTELLE: Oh, my God!    
JERRY:  That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about. 
ELAINE: Well, have you ever considered writing new material? 
JERRY: Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done. 
ELAINE:  Me? Are you talking about me? 
JERRY:  No. You're never here. 
ELAINE:  Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it? 
JERRY: Yeah. Really.  Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show. 
ELAINE: What? 
JERRY: Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny.  I'm gonna call them.   
SALLY: Hello? 
JERRY: Hello, Susan? It's Jerry. 
SALLY: Hi Jerry, it's Sally! 
JERRY:  Oh. Is George there? 
SALLY: No, but he should be home soon. 
JERRY: Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her. 
SALLY: Is this for your comedy routine? 
JERRY:  Yes. 
SALLY:  Don't worry.  I'm on the case.        
MAESTRO:  I, uh, think I'll get some air.  
KRAMER: Yeah..  See? This is no good..  Hey, the baton.  I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss.  13 in the side pocket.  Giddy-up.  Six in the corner.  This table's mine.  You know where it's going..       
ELAINE AND JERRY: Hey! 
ELAINE: Is George here? 
JERRY: Not yet.  The other guy.   
ELAINE: It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me? 
CARRERAS: My pleasure.  
ELAINE:  Oh, thank you so much.  Thank you so much, Mr..  Camaro.  Mr. Casea?  Well, whatever.  I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center. 
JERRY:  Well, that's one hell of a gig.  Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent! 
ELAINE:  Ohh.. thank you.  Huh..  Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box? 
JERRY: Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging. 
ELAINE:  How am I supposed to carry this thing?  What are you doing? 
JERRY: Well, I want to sit down. 
ELAINE: So? 
JERRY: It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants.       
MAESTRO:  Madame, you have been an extremely gracious hostess.  
ESTELLE:  Ohh.. thank you, Maestro.  
FRANK:  Here, take a look at this. 
ESTELLE:  Yeah, what is it? 
FRANK: It's Carlo. I found him! 
ESTELLE:  You've been cooped up in this room too long. 
FRANK:  You never support me! Let's see what George says about this.. Where're my pants?  
KRAMER:  Aw, beautiful!      
SALLY: Hey there, Mr. Hairy legs! 
JERRY:  Where's George? 
SALLY: Don't worry, I brought your doll..  Tada! 
JERRY:  No! That's the wrong doll! 
SALLY: Jerry, I saw the doll you were talking about - not funny! This doll's much funnier. Look, it has a little bowtie, and a cute little hat.. I think it's a riot! 
JERRY:  This is a nightmare. 
SALLY: Oh well, I'll be watching.  Don't screw up.    Too much sauce..  
JERRY: My pants!   
STAGEHAND: Mr. Seinfeld, you're on.      
MAESTRO: Elaine? What a surprise. 
ELAINE: I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this. 
MAESTRO: Ohh..  Ori-dent - that electric toothbrush I've heard so much about.. 
ELAINE: No, no, no. Not the toothbrush..  this.   
MAESTRO: Ohh, what a sweet gesture. And autographed poster of my favorite tenor, with.. those two other guys. Oh, Elaine, this is magnifico! 
ELAINE: Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany.. 
STAGEHAND:  Maestro, you're on! 
MAESTRO: Oh, Elaine.. wait for me after the concert? We'll celebrate. 
ELAINE: Oh, ok!         
SUSAN: I want to know why you took my doll out of the house. 
GEORGE: I just wanted a second opinion.   
FRANK:  Take a look at this. Doesn't that look like my flesh and blood? Of course, your mother-  
DOLL: Oh, stop bothering everybody with that picture. It's ridiculous! 
FRANK:  Ridiculous?! I'll show you ridiculous!  Come here! 
SUSAN:  No, Mr. Costanza! No, no!   
FRANK:  There! Now what have you got to say for yourself?! 
GEORGE:  I told you it looked like her..      
FRANK:  Carlo! It's me, Frank!  I'm your cousin, Frank! Aren't you Carlo? 
MAN: Carlo? No. Mi nome e Giuseppe. 
FRANK:  What do you know.. Alright.  I guess I was wrong.
